This project is about categorizing user reviews. I collected data set from amazon. Using POS tag pattern,
I identified the features of the product. But there can be lot of features. but i need most important features.
Using Apriori algorithm, I could fetch the most frequent features. then categorize reviews according to  their feature.
Split data set for train and test. here I used LogisticRegression, Naive Bayes Classifier, support vector machine, and
random forest classifier to train the model and predict the accuracy.
