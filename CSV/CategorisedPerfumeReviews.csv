I haven't been a big fan of Prada's fragrances over the years but absolutely fell in love with the sweetness and candy-like scent of this perfume! This smells like a sweet decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I'm not sure what else but it smells great! Although I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle! You could get the . oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus (the . oz for around $ if you prefer a smaller bottle)! Love the smell of this!,Neutral
Got this product and I never heard of this so I took a chance and when I got it I fell head over heels for this new smell I won't let anybody use this perfume but me sounds selfish but its my favorite now so thanks for selling a wonderful perfume I will be stocking up on this product My new smell!,Neutral
This is a beautiful perfume! Nice clean scent! Perfect for day or night and never gets old. I ordered this perfume (and this was the best price offered) and it came with a lotion too! That was a nice unexpected surprise! :) One of my favs!,Neutral
This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance.  My bottle was not open tampered with or have a strong alcohol smell. I love how clean this perfume smells. I tried it out at Macy's. I wanted to try a fendi  scent but the salesman asked me to try Bright Crystal and another Versace scent. I smelled the other first and then Bright Crystal. I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal. I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price. The bottle is huge! I'll be wearing this everyday to the office I'm sure I'll receive tons of compliments. Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean I don't have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting. Thanks amazon! Smells clean,Neutral
I like this perfume. I first discovered it when it was an insert in a magazine i was reading and i fell in love with it. i purchased it on amazon and received it shortly afterward. I really like this soft flirty smell but i didnt get nearly as many comments/ compliments on it as i do with my regular perfumes... kind of a bummer... but i still like the fragrance.... yummy soft smell,Neutral
I am not a perfume wearer but I heard that this is very light and unlike any other perfume. I got this in the roll-on and I don't care for it at all. Just like all other perfumes it makes me nauseated. I'll be giving this to a relative for Christmas. Not for me,Neutral
Sorry about the title. . . I couldn't help myself . . . . Anyways Let me begin by saying there are few things more subjective than a fragrance especially a woman's fragrance. I'm a woman (and proud) and I know how finicky we can be. But that's besides the point let's focus on Stella.Instead of expressing a biased opinion I'm going take a objective POV. I'm going to explain the ingredients . . .Yes you heard me . .the ingredients . . .Sure . .The /are/ listed here but do you really know what they are . . .I'm not going to explain them all but hopefully enough to help you understand the science of the scent as well as the actually scent itself. H'okay here we go!*Centaurea Cyanus = the common Cornflower aka bluebottle aka the Buttonierre Flower*Squalene (which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark {most likely its just synthetically created now}) = a natural moisturizer. It penetrates the skin quickly but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka Sweet Almond (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate  is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a skin protectant whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength it lasts around  hours or so it's a casual scent . .not to fancy but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent. It takes a mature nose to adjust to the kalaedoscope (sp?) of smells that is STELLA. STELLLAAA!!!!!,Neutral
For having a bunch of promises about how well it'll work this bottle is only about a two-week supply and it makes no difference in anything--sweat breath etc. Save your money and just use perfume and lots of soap and mints! Does NOTHING,Neutral
I'm on accutane which has caused me to get some dandruff (I normally never have it). After freaking out and doing research I bought this. It seems to have lessened the severity of my dandruff after just one use but the smell is SO AWFUL! It's like I dipped my head into a freakin tank of gas! I have long hair and to try to get that smell off is  impossible. I have to put really potent anti-frizz serum in it then spray some of my strong perfume DIRECTLY on my hair in order to TRY to mask up the smell. Even then it still stinks.If you like the smell of tar and gas this is for you. If not try to get the clean scent. I haven't tried it so I don't know if it's realyl different. Honestly I'm thinking I'd rather have dandruff than stinky hair. It works...but the stench!,Neutral
I have been a sufferer of dandruff ever since I was a child. When I was younger my head would itch so bad I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt.One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  The doctor said Neutrogena T-Gel. I asked Is that a prescription? No he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work so I gave it a shot.This stuff has been a life-saver. It's not very glamorous looking - brown weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick curly hair.  The longer you let it sit on your scalp the better -  minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle your hair just smells fresh and clean.Unlike other shampoos I have never had to take a vacation and use another shampoo to liven up my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient Coal Tar is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  I have used T-Gel for almost  years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head  times a year. About % of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos but just after  hair washings w/o T-Gel my scalp will start itching again.  It seems expensive when you see the price but one bottle usually lasts me for - months since you only need a little dab.When I used to color my hair I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still no itching.If you have dandruff and haven't tried T-Gel just give it a try - in one week you should be symptom free! works wonders!,Neutral
No perfume smell or irritant to scalp. Hair feels clean and not weighted down from conditioning. Very happy with this product and will continue to use. Best Rinse,Neutral
I really have only one complaint; so far as I can tell in essentials this bar cleanser is much the same as it ever was but I could SWEAR that the bar I used several years ago was fragrance-free. I know I would never have even tried it if it had smelled like this then. I mean part of the Cetaphil brand's selling point is that its skincare products have no fragrance added to them that would irritate sensitive skin. So why does this Cetaphil product have any fragrance at all?I usually have no problems with lightly-scented skincare products provided they are only LIGHTLY scented. I'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients but I still have to avoid most of them because for me strong perfumes set off major migraines. Other than that some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice. But this... THIS was like my worst nightmare of every ancient long-expired bottle of old-lady perfume dumped into a single bar. It's intolerable. I couldn't even just throw it away; it still stunk up the whole bathroom from the bathroom trash can. I ended up taking it straight outside to the dumpster. And I still had to empty the half-full bathroom garbage to get rid of that sickening cloying unbearable scent that sparked off a -day migraine.Maybe I'm just missing something obvious. I would appreciate it if someone could let me know IF Cetaphil still makes a fragrance-free bar soap/cleanser. I'd like to go back to using an old favorite but I can't find the old favorite. What happened to the Cetaphil bar I used to know and love?,sensitive skin
After many different skin moisturizers for my sensitive skin I stopped at this one to balance my skin type. No perfume and not greasy. My favourite skin moisturizer,sensitive skin
On my doctor's advice I started using Cetaphil products. I absolutely love the moisturizing cream as it seems to really sink into the skin and moisturize it. I always apply this cream before going to sleep at night followed up by an application the following day. During particularly dry seasons I may apply this cream several times a day.This stuff really works. I suffer from very dry skin and Atopic Dermatitis. Applying the Cetaphil cream seems to help alleviate these skin conditions. What is really nice is the skin cream is unscented. Sensitive skin like mine can be irritated by perfumed lotions.Highly reommend. Wonderful for sensitive dry skin,dry skin
I do like this face cream. It does not have perfume. The consistency is watery and my skin absorbs it quickly.  However on those days when my skin got very dry I found it to be not moisturizing enough. I recommend it for the summer use. For winter it depends on your skin. If your skin tends to be very dry then you may want to find something else. Good for not very dry skin,Neutral
First of all I'm  so I'm not a  year-old who has no real wrinkles or skin issues such as unevenness and sun damage. I've got it all plus super sensitive skin. I've been using this product during the day and even sometimes at night for a few weeks now with no irritation and great results. Some of my friends had mentioned another product that might be even better so I briefly switched to RoC's Deep Wrinkle line. OMG. I only lasted two days using it because of the perfumes and the general heaviness/oiliness I experienced not to mention it made my eyes water (and I didn't even put any around my eyes). I took those products back needless to say. The grass is always greener--not.Neutrogena Healthy Skin is a great line in general. I now use the eye cream and the night creme as well as the day creme. I will stick with this line and not stray again. It goes on silky no oily feel no harsh perfumes and no skin or eye irritation (and I use it around my eyes). I wake up looking a little brighter every day. Deeper smile lines and brow furrows are softening more and more skin is more even and sun damage is lightening up. :)Love the line. Works for me.UPDATE APRIL   (I am now . fyi)Well I have to admit I've been lax about using my little best buddy face cream since I wrote my original review...To my dismay at my skin check my dermatologist asked me What are you doing differently since I saw you  months ago? Your skin looks more uneven and I think you may even need a special cream for some developing actinic keratosis. (common rough patches from UV exposure that can lead to skin cancer). I freaked out a bit and thought immediately that about six months ago I stopped using this cream...damn. I had moved and disrupted my routine blah blah blah and thought that a couple of days wouldn't hurt me. Well a couple of days turned into months...She told me that I could either go the prescription route that stings like an SOB and makes your face all red and weird for days....or I could go back to using the Neutrogena and STICK WITH IT. I think I'll do the Neutrogena...live and learn my friends. RoC doesn't Rock like Neutrogena does!,sensitive skin
I've tried nearly all of the major anti-aging creams out there. I've tried all the big drugstore brands (olay Roc etc) I've tried department store brands (clinique origins etc) and I keep coming back to this one every time. I love that it does not have a fragrance (the overpowering scent of perfume is what turned me off from Roc). I love that it's not greasy but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed. Most of all I love that this -something girl still gets carded regularly when I buy a bottle of wine at the grocery store. Really what more can a girl ask for from a wrinkle cream? The best cream for the money,Neutral
The Neutrogena Body Oil is very light. I use this when I get out of the shower and within minutes it is absorbed into my skin and my skin is hydrated through out the day. My skin does not feel oily or greasy just soft and smooth. I love that this oil is very lighly scented and does not interfere with my perfume or body spray. Hydrates Your Skin Perfectly!,Neutral
Two days after I started using this product which I love I noticed that my skin was mush smoother and shinier than it had been before. I love the way it smells and after using it and then going out I've gotten complements on my perfume even though this body oil is all that I was wearing. I put it on mysking while it's still damp just when I get out of the shower. Highly recommended. Fantasti,Neutral
BUT NOT ANYMORE!!! This product is awesome. I put just a wee bit in my bathwater and voila!! Gets to places I was too lazy to reach. I'm not itchy from this terribly dry winter we're having and my skin doesn't feel tight. I love to also use this oil as a massage oil. There's no fragrance which I like because it allows me to put on perfume without feeling too scented.Pros:Not greasy in the bathtubHydratingSoothing for itchy dry skinSpreads easilyAbsorbs quicklyCons:Can get a little priceyMust...have....more..... So I have dry itchy skin....,Neutral
I have always loved this oil.  I haven't used it in a while so I was thrilled to get it for such a good price.  I use it on my wet skin right after a shower or bath.....it's WONDERFUL!!!  It's light and not greasy at all.  The smell is divine but not overpowering; you can still wear your favorite perfume or body spray and it won't clash.  It's also great as a cuticle oil. Have always loved this oil,favorite perfume
This is hands down THE best product for dry hands! As it says on the front of the tube just a dab rubbed into the back of each hand and poof scales cracks dryness and pain are GONE. The effects last for several washings. It's amazing. One tube lasts a long time because you use only a dab at a time. Don't over-apply! Suggestion: draw a short thin line of product across the back of one hand and use one finger of the other hand to massage it in from wrist to fingertips; after the gel turns white and then disappears into your skin repeat on the opposite hand; then rub your hands together to get any remaining gel onto the inside of your hands. Apply sparingly. Don't use it like ordinary hand lotions/creams - it's not like those products; it's a one-of-a-kind product. Applied correctly it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy. It's fragrance-free so there's no obnoxious perfume smell. Enjoy! Just A Dab results in Hand HEAVEN!,Neutral
I don't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser.  I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream.  It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either.  I don't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product.  It's really too bad because it is a good price and I can't afford more expensive products. Strong perfume frangrance did not remove mascar,Neutral
This does have the extra ingredients that some people on here are unhappy about but it does not sting or burn me whatsoever. It feels very mild and nice on my face. Everybody was raving about the smell so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother's perfume. It's not a bad smell at all though. The cream takes my make-up off nicely even tough liquid liner. I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever. You only need a very small amount to do the trick. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody! Great product!,great product
Trying it on face but still has perfume added to it so it's a no go for me. It didn't do anything but make face sticky. POND'S Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer .-Ounce,dry skin

I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price.  It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless.  When I got home I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product.  I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original almost-odorless formula. New bottle tint and perfume,Neutral
Good  house hold but not for the skin.What u pay is what u get Intense smell of chimical perfume,Neutral
I wanted to like this body wash. I really did. The price was right and I thought the product would be natural enough for me. Apparently not.Immediately upon opening the box I could smell the perfume. The bottles weren't leaking at all either. So very strong scent. Now let's be clear: I AM mildly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes but I can't recall ever sneezing uncontrollably to anything NATURAL. I use essential oils all the time (which have strong scents though natural) as well as heavily scented natural products. Never a problem there. This made me sneeze like crazy when I used it. That's not a desirable effect in a shower with hard surfaces to knock one's head on when you're flailing like well a person who is sneezing like crazy. It's especially not good for someone who recently had hip surgery (no people I'm actually only ) because sneezing can make you nearly fall over in a slippery shower especially when you're already unsteady. When I first got this (before surgery) it was still making me sneeze a week later. I thought *Hmm that might fade. I might get acclimated to it. I'd better give it a good go since I bought so much of it!* I bought this in November. It is now April. I have NOT acclimated to it. Still sneezing and it's from this product. I know because I've made brief switches to other products (Burt's Bees African Black bar soaps castile soap) and haven't sneezed. Then I use this again. I shower sneeze my brains out hope I don't crack my head or fall almost do and kick myself for buying this. I'm not exaggerating; the sneezing fits are really quite extraordinary. I leave the door unlocked so my husband can rescue me in the event of a sneezing catastrophe. But well... at least you know it lasts a long time!? I wish it didn't. Why am I still using it? Waste not want not with a caveat: Hope you don't die in the shower.There is definitely a chemical smell to this. Lavender? HA! One of my favorite essential oils to use is Lavender. This is NOT LAVENDER! It smells (to me) like a chemical re-creation of lavender. A very poor one.It does have its merits however. What I can say for the wash is this: A couple of pumps does the job rather well though I'm petite so you may need a few more. It lathers well for a not-so-conventional wants-to-be-natural body wash. It makes you feel clean without drying yet doesn't make you feel over-moisturized or coated in something like super-moisturizing washes do. It also hasn't caused any skin irritation which is a miracle for me considering my reaction to the scent and sensitive skin. The product is a good value if your body doesn't give you violent reactions to it. So three stars. I'm trying to be fair.Given the cleansing performance of this product some (curious or self-destructive) part of me is tempted to try the tea tree. I love tea tree almost as much as lavender. But since this smells like chemical NOT-lavender I'm afraid of what the tea tree would smell like/do. Perhaps it will make my eyeballs bleed and fall out? Okay I'm kidding about my eyeballs. But I wouldn't buy this product again. If there is an unscented version I might try a sample to see if it makes me react. Otherwise when I'm done with this I shall steer clear of the body wash of doom. Smells like chemicals not Lavender. Sensitive people beware!,long time
I never thought a soap could make such a big difference.  I switched to this soap about ten days ago and I can't believe how much better my skin feels especially my face and hands.The Aveeno bar looks and feels completely different from any other bar soap.  It does not lather to any great extent which may bother some people but the fact is that lather serves no cleaning purpose.  It does feel creamy and pleasant.  It also has a smell that well smells like oatmeal so that is an adjustment.  It is not unpleasant just different.  It does not transfer to the skin nor can I smell the bar when I walk into the bathroom which is important to me as I do not like perfumed or flowery soaps that (to me) stink up the room.I was worried that it would not be effective in removing makeup especially mascara but it works just fine.Aveeno also has a new product a moisturizer for people with eczema Aveeno Active Naturals Eczema Care Moisturizing Cream  Oz that I also started using a week ago and the effects of the combination of the two is a marvel.  I occasionally have mild eczema outbreaks so I cannot speak for those with more severe cases or itching skin but this bar and the moisturizer have worked wonders for me. Amazing!,Neutral
Can't stand perfume and its in everything. ( Perfumed toilet paper is just strange!) This is great for medoesn't take forever to be absorbed. I have it on auto ship. Sent to me every other month cause I have my husband use it too. He's had a lot of skin cancer on his face and this spf  is just enough for regular daily use. I use this in the morning and a heavier one at night. The dermatologist says my  year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass. Lets keep it that way! great for sensitive skin and noses!,sensitive skin
I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it's unscented.  (Hurrah if I want perfume I prefer what I use!)  I've been very happy with it ever since. It's not messy is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it.  If you wear make-up it'll go over the moisturizer with no problem. The anti-aging must work as I get a lot of comments that I don't look my age! () I don't wear make-up except for eyes and mouth so what people see is what's there wrinkles and all.Recommend highly. Olay Total Effects -in- Anti-Aging UV Moisturizer SPF ,Neutral
After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years I really wanted to try it.  I actually tried it about two or three years ago and found it to be too heavy.  But I think my problem was not the moisturizer but the face wash I was using.  I had always thought my skin was oily so I was constantly using products designed for oily/acne prone skin.  I think I was drying my skin out causing it to produce extra oil to compensate.  Anyway I'm now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin which work great.  Up until about  months ago I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin which was working fine but I wanted something with anti-aging properties since I just turned .Since I've been using the Total Effects I've noticed that my skin is softer.  It also appears to be a little brighter.  The tone is evened out some as well.  I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose.  That has not completely gone away but it is diminished.  I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now especially if I moisturize before bedtime (I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream) but more often than not I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing.  Also I use the Fragrance Free version (with SPF) and it truly is free of any perfumes.  The only smell I get is from the SPF.I like the pump design but it is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle.  I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount.  One bottle has lasted me from the beginnng of August until now (Oct. ) and there is a little left which I expect to run out any day now so about  months.  I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle which is  oz so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.I'm very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it along with my other Olay products. It's just right,Neutral
I've tried many different moisturizers.  I've been looking for something that helps with the fine lines but doesn't make my face greasy or clog my pores.  I love this moisturizer!  It feels like velvet absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my face to break out.  The description says it's unscented but it does have a very very light fragrance.  It's not perfumey just fresh and clean.  I'm on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin. This formulation is perfect for my  year-old combination skin.,Neutral
This creme is priced well very hydrating is not perfumey and it doesn't clog my pores. It won't make old wrinkles disappear but since it's so hydrating I do notice my wrinkles stand out a lot more when I don't use it. Whether or not it prevents new wrinkles I don't know; but I do get told frequently I look much younger than I am. As a side note I think it feels very nice and refreshing on the skin. Hydrating and well-priced,Neutral
Used for about  months.  Did seem to help soften the wrinkles that I had started to notice.  Product absorbs quite well and isn't overly greasy although consistency is rather thick.  I have acne prone skin and dry skin areas and while it did not aggravate my acne it didn't really help the dry areas either (surprising considering the consistency).  I hate strong perfume-y night cream on my face when I'm trying to sleep (which is one of the reasons I don't care for olay products) and this product could pass exactly for a tub of margarine or butter for color smell and texture.  It was better than perfume but I didn't exactly love it either. margarine,dry skin
Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar is a non-alkaline non-soap bar that its makers claim to be non-comedogenic hypoallergenic and free of harsh detergents that might dry or irritate the skin. The makers also state it can be used for facial or full body cleaning and is designed for dry sensitive skin to moisturize as it cleans.  Its active ingredient they state is Triclosan; it is a neutral pH formulation that will leave no residue.  The manufacturers further claim that it is good for many skin conditions such as eczema and is as mild as the mildest bar cleanser. It is manufactured by Galderma Laboratories major benefactor of the Dermatology Foundation helping to fund dermatology research.This bar has worked very nicely for me.  I turned to it after messing up my hands by use of a perfumed soap bar: mind you I know/knew better than to use perfumed soap which has always caused my hands to get red raw and covered with rash.  But when a bar of perfumed soap comes as a gift from someone of whom I'm fond I can't resist it.  So anyway after a few weeks' use of the Cetaphil bar my hands are looking and feeling much better not nearly as red sore and painful.  You might give it a try if you find yourself in a similar situation. Good for Many Skin Conditions,sensitive skin
I have spent hundreds of dollars on lotions and have a cabinet full that just didn't seem to do the job. Rich and creamy this lotion is the only lotion I will use now. I have bought the lavender and the vanilla for my mom.  My aunt saw my arms and legs and asked how do I keep them looking so great! Ecco Bella i told her.  Now Ecco Bella is the only lotion she uses also.  A little goes a long way so although it may feel expensive it is worth it.  The vanilla scent stays all day long.  Even when I use a vanilla based perfume like Shalimar it will fade but the lotion scent will come though.  I have found i get the most compliments when I use the Ecco Bella Bouboun Vanilla Perfume along with the lotion.  I use this every morning.  My skin does not feel the dryness I used to always experience.  My doctor told me to take care of my feet as they were cracking.  **blush** Last time she saw my feet she was impressed and is now an EccoBella lotion fan herself. My skin is so soft and supple.  Really the best lotion i have ever used. Vanilla Heaven,Neutral
Thick rich and creamy almost resembling custard this lotion not only gives an intense and healing comfort to the skin but the scent is pure heaven! I also adore the fact that the brand is holistic and cares about animals no cruel testing and it uses pure plants and botanicals to produce a truly nourishing product.Brimming with goodies such as aloe sunflower coconut safflower sesame babasu oils vitamins E and A organic calendula and chamomile and a yummy burst of vanilla this lotion hydrates all day and well into the night. The scent was the best part of it slightly smoky at first little plasticky ( I know it sounds weird) it mellows into a cake like aroma within minutes of putting it on and I swear I could smell the vanilla bean all day long. It was quite an experience to smell like a cupcake until the nightly shower I might have to stock up since the bottles are small but I can't seem to get enough of it. I skip wearing perfume the days when I use this so that I can enjoy the strong delicious scent exuding from the skin. This brand has a few other fragrances that I want to try but first I have to satisfy my vanilla craving which are being fueled every time I wear this.Also this lotion has no water in it making it really luxurious and very emollient great for anyone with dry skin who likes scented lotions. Lack of preservatives is also a plus something I pay more attention to as I get older and wiser  : )- Kasia S. Belissima vanill,dry skin
I will put my review here although the product I've been using is their Grapefruit scented lotion.  This lotion is rich creamy and long lasting.  I can apply it in the morning after my shower and it lasts all day.  The smell is quite neutral (very mild) - which is helpful because I like to wear perfumes & essential oils.  It leaves the slightest oily residue but it really isn't noticeable - I even apply the lotion to my face.  If you find it to be oily just add a little bit of water when rubbing into the skin and you will feel quite tender & juicy - a naturally supple feel to the skin.  A little bit goes a long way.  My  oz bottle lasted me  year and sadly my store stopped carrying it - so I have recently tried numerous other natural lotions only to be disappointed.  I will stick to Ecco Bella lotions from now on.  Nothing else compares.  No Parabens SLS etc either! Creamy & Long Lasting Lotion,little bit
I have pretty sensitive skin and have tried a number of different masks through out the years and they almost always either make my face itchy or cause me to break out after using them (in those horrible big and painful zits!)...this one doesn't! It seems like it both dries out the extra oil in my skin and moisturizes at the same time. After washing it off my skin is always a lot softer. If my skin is a little dried out I tend to get those little bumps on the outer edges of my cheeks but they always clear up when I use this. It has a good consistency and is easy to apply though if you wash it off with a wash cloth it looks sort of nasty but no big deal. It does have a little bit of a scent to it but it's not a fake perfumey type of scent it's a more natural one. And one of my favorite things about this mask it's cheap! Definitely recommend! LOVE this!,little bit
I love Alba products for being natural and wonderful!  I also love the micro nutrients in the sea minerals.  This moisturizer is great for my dry skin it tones and leaves my skin feeling great and nice and soft.  It takes a little bit of time to sink in but it does sink in eventually and the moisturizing properties last and last.  I love this stuff.I've tried the Olay total effects and I hated it.  It was heavily perfumed greasy and never seemed to sink in.  Alba's is light and MUCH nicer without being greasy it is much better.  Alba's products are always nice cruelty free and natural as well a MUST HAVE for me.  Great product!  Also you can apply make up cleanly over it once its absorbed after a few minutes.  Really great.  ^^ great moisturizer great company!,great product
Not sure why everything needs to be so perfumed these days.  I would especially expect a product advertised as 'natural' to be just that natural w/o perfumes.  Not the case.  I won't buy it again just because of that factor. Nice feel but too much fragrance,Neutral
I have always spent a lot of money on shampoo. I am a fan of the original Pureology lines (not the cheap crap you get now at Target) and I love LUSH but they're both so *expensive*. It was the case that the only vegan/cruelty-free/high-quality ingredient/environmentally safe/people safe shampoos were hard to find and pay for. But. . .Finally! A shampoo that is:-good for oily scalp without stripping the life out of the rest of your hair-ok for color treated (mine is bleached)-smells and feels wonderfully cool and refreshing without a hint of fakey perfume-affordable (!)-good for the environment animals and people-made by an ethically empowered company you can feel good about supporting-responsibly packaged with post consumer recycled content-lacking in artificial colors scentsThis is not quite the experience you get from a $ bottle of shampoo but it's darned good anyhow and you can't beat the price tag at a fraction of the cost of the salon bottles. If you have oily scalp but don't want to turn the rest of your hair into straw this is worth a try and if you don't like it you won't be so broke you can't buy something else. FINALLY! Good for oily hair environment AND other living things,Neutral
Ok ok...I'll admit it. I'm a convert. Looking back I am able to see how silly I was - but at the time purchasing Badger Balm just seemed...unnecessary. Like a luxury. Why pay for Badger Balm when I can use olive oil to work with metal clay (PMC) and use lotion to condition my skin the rest of the time? I would rather spend those bucks on more PMC!Or so I thought until I took the plunge and bought some Badger Balm. In my defense olive oil is cheap. And readily available. And easy to use. And natural so it's safe for kids and those with allergies. And a little goes a long way. But...BUT...those things said there just isn't any comparison with Badger Balm. Talk about a little going a long way? Hello! Badger Balm has that covered. The smell? A light fresh scent - nothing overpowering or stinky. It isn't greasy. Don't get me wrong - it does kind of coat your hands but it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy - or like you're helpless. You can still open jars with Badger Balm on...not so easy with regular lotion impossible with olive oil slathered all over your digits!Badger Balm easily coats your PMC tools and work surface - without leaving everything slickery if ya know what I mean. It also seems to be a good skin conditioner in general - I finally remembered to put some on my feet when I went to bed - and it helped to soften the skin. I can see how using it on a regular basis could easily eliminate dry cracked heels. (Not that mine were that bad mind you.) This is the perfect moisturizer to throw in your purse.So here's the low down: I would buy this again. Especially since it seems the  oz pot I bought will last a very long time. I like this much better than olive oil for use with PMC. I'm not sure how it stacks up against regular lotion - since I live in a very dry climate I'm a lotionaholic. Badger Balm takes up less space won't spill if you're traveling and like I previously said doesn't leave your hands all lotiony. Or perfumey. (I'm using a lot of my own words...sorry!) However I have a hard time remembering to use it instead of lotion. The price seems reasonable - especially since it lasts for so long. I think it's a good thing to keep around - which is definitely true for those needing a good release agent for PMC...however I don't see it replacing my lotion anytime soon. To be totally honest I'm not sure I see a huge difference between Badger Balm and Bag Balm - except the Badger Balm seems to be lighter. I would love it if someone would please explain why Badger Balm is better than Bag Balm (for use with PMC) - and how it's different. (I don't believe either is water soluble.) Anyway you now have the skinny on Badger Balm and how it relates to olive oil PMC and lotion...and even a bonus question about Badger Balm vs Bag Balm. Try it - I think you'll like it. Badger Balm is Da Bomb (for PMC),long way
I applied Olay Total Effects one time.  I thought the scent was strong but hoped that it would dissipate in a few minutes.  Wrong.  I had to wash my face and hands - twice - to get rid of the stink.  And I do mean stink - overwhelming fake floral yukkiness.  Like perfume that costs $. for  oz. at Walmart.If artificial fragrances bother you give this one a pass. Overwhelming cloying scent.  YUK.,Neutral
This has become one of my favorite creams.  I love the soft silky feel on my face and the lightly perfumed scent.  I try to use it sparingly so that I don't run out.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in a larger size.  Would definitely buy again. Great Cream!,Neutral
I'm a sucker for anything rose-scented especially body products. I eyed this Rose Milk Skin Care Loton for a very very long time before I finally thought what are you waiting for? and ordered it. I must mention that have no nostalgia tied to the product no memories of my mother or grandmother smelling of its elegance-by-association with as they kissed me goodnight.So with no pre-set expectations I opened it immediately (even as other family members were clamoring for their part of the order) and breathed it in: a powdery true rose scent almost old-fashioned somehow. Just the way I like it. I let out two sighs one of relief and one of delight.I've first I applied it a few times to my hands and arms and later my body's shoulders d&eacute;colletage legs and feet.My reactions:) This is far more moisturizing than I expected! Many perfumed lotions will wind up only drying you out (Bath & Body Works for example has never satisfied my skin. And I only use one kind: Pink Peony because it includes notes of rose.)a) The alcohol content of Rose Milk is not specified but it does come towards the middle of the ingredients list meaning the prime ingredients are: water mineral oil and glycerin before the various types of alcohol start popping up.)(Comparatively my B&BW; list reads water glycerin petrolatum and then cetyl alcohol launched the longer list of ingredients.)b)  Maybe that mineral oil is giving it some staying power? All I know is my skin feels so good and I won't be reaching for the bottle again and again. That's a relief.) The rose scent is light indeed. I'm not slipping into a silky peignoir made of rose petals to be sure. But I won't be overwhelming innocent souls who must work next me to or sleep beside me. It's my personal fragrance in my personal space. I like that.A) This stuff does NOT smell like grannies! Despite the nostalgia factor for some as someone whose grandmothers did not use t I do not associate it with little old ladies at all except that I think it would be a wonderful useful well-enjoyed gift for Nanas everywhere. :)) The lotion is creamy enough for a little to go a long way. A dime-sized amount is enough the moisturize both my hands and arms.) I'm noticing the fragrance seems buildable perhaps. Apply in layers to carefully strengthen the scent!) I have but one complaint: this is not a pump bottle nor does it have a snap cap. A loose cap is a challenge no matter who you are no matter how old you are. It can easily be knocked off the dresser or bedside and could roll out of reach under furniture. If there are dogs or children around yikes! Danger! It's quite quite frustrating as I have a tough-luck history with such things (no not children and dogs but runaway caps.)Ultimately I had to take away a star (I wish I could only dock it a half star) for the loose-bottle-top issue.But otherwise this Rose Milk is a romantic soothing skin softening treat and and excellent value over luxury brands I haven't even mentioned. You had me at rose! A lovely effective moisturizing lotion.,long way
It was difficult to choose which of these Clearly Natural soaps to purchase but I finally settled on honeysuckle.  I don't use bar soap anymore body wash or shower gel tends to be my preference but I was drawn to Clearly Natural because of the cost and the fact that it claims to be a natural glycerin soap.I've used the unscented glycerin soap and I like it but this one?  I'm just not sure.  I'm not sure that it is as pure and natural as it is claimed to be.  It was extremely drying and somewhat harsh on my sensitive skin.  It is a brilliant yellow which indicates a fair amount of dyes in it.  And the fragrance?  It is a bit too perfumed for my liking.  Honeysuckle is supposed to be a light floral scent but this soap is scented strongly.  I can't explain it but it is migraine-worthy.  There is no humectant in the glycerin which also left me an unhappy camper...and I don't like to write bad reviews.  I thought glycerin soaps were meant to be soothing and gentle but this one is just not my favorite by a long shot.I definitely won't repurchase this soap in honeysuckle but maybe I'll try the aloe vera one.  As mentioned previously I also like the unscented version because it contains no dyes or perfumes.  The unscented one is clear/transparent and full of natural skin-loving ingredients unlike the honeysuckle one.  The packaging is somewhat eco-friendly and at least the product is inexpensive so even if you don't like it there will be no guilt about throwing money away. Not sure about this one...,sensitive skin
A few years ago I began to notice little red patches all over my skin just as spring and the season of shorts was approaching. One panicked trip to the dermatologist later I found out that I had nummular eczema which is basically a fancy way of saying that my skin was a dry finicky old hag who I needed to start treating with kid gloves: no fabric softener no perfumed skin products and lots of daily moisturizing. My doctor recommended that I start using Aveeno products because their natural ingredients are among the gentlest on the skin and she specifically said that the Aveeno Active Naturals lotions tend to do the best job at moisturizing. $ seemed a little steep when I bought my first bottle from a local drugstore but I swallowed my complaints and started applying this daily after my morning showers to help lock in the moisture. Within a week the eczema had cleared up considerably and not long after that I actually started getting unsolicited compliments on how soft and smooth my skin was -- it had gone from angry hag to cooing baby in just under a month (Benjamin Button eat your heart out).Aside from it helping alleviate my skin condition this Aveeno lotion is also just pleasant to use; it's unscented and unobtrusive and it rubs into your skin really well without leaving any funky sticky residue behind. After a while I started using Amazon's Subscribe & Save service to stock up which has saved me money (it's usually under $ per bottle) and the worry that I'll ever run out of this great stuff.In short: Aveeno products may cost more than other brands but they're worth it. Take it from a former hag-skinned girl. Simply the best,Neutral
For really irritated hands Aveeno Hand Cream Intense Relief with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal is IT! My hands have actually been so dry that the skin was cracked and hand washing and drying was torture. THIS PRODUCT was the solution. No other hand cream on the market can match it's ability to protect so well that the skin can begin to heal. There is no perfume or medicinal smell. Works like magic! Soothing protection!,dry skin
My husband & I do not like moisturizers with perfumes.  We both like this one very much because it absorbs into the skin and doesn't smell like a perfume counter.  We use it every day and before going to sleep.  This is a heavier version of the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion; if you like a lighter lotion you may want to try that one.  This lotion has shea butter which is super rich & moisturizing.  It will feel a little greasy when you first put it on but it absorbs quickly & becomes less greasy.It also works wonders on dry heels elbows & chapped hands.  And it does this without perfumey stink!Lighter Version:Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion  Ounce Super Moisturizing without Perfume,Neutral
First you can never go wrong with Aveeno lotion.  Your skin will be silky smooth and not needing more in  mins!  I bough this kind for my mother who can not stand any perfumes or lotions with perfumes in them.  She is extremely sensitive to smells and she raved about this kind and begging me to buy her more!  She often complains about &#;fragrance free&#; still having some sort of smells.  Avveno lives up to its words!  Will be buying again Great Lotion!,Neutral
I like to use SPF during the summer months and this moisturizer fits the bill.  It feels great under makeup has no perfume-y odor and is a great price point. It is no frillsbut does the job!  For the winter months I would suggest layering this with another moisturizer if you have dry skin.  Overall great product and I haven't burned yet! Lightweight and SPF!,great product

This is a nice spray perfume.  The scent stays on longer that others.  My husband liked it too.My teenage daughter snuck some when I wasn't looking. I liked the price too. Hugo by Hugo Boss for Women  Toilette Spray,Neutral
If applied over wet skin right after the shower it helps seal in moisture.  It has a lovely almond-like scent.  The scent is not very strong and does not clash with perfume. Soft almondy scent,Neutral
The product name Stress Relief Body Wash says it all. This wonderful product put out by Aveeno does the job. Made with wonderful ingredients like lavender chamomile and ylang-ylang you feel the stress of the day melt off of your body. Its special soap free formula gets the job done in addition to the wonderful addition of oatmeal as a base. It smells heavenly without being tacky or overly perfumed. Please use this if you need a lift or simply a release from day-to-day pressure. This is good as a companion item to any shower in America...... This product really delivers...,Neutral
Very high quality considering the low price. The only drawback is that it is highly scented. It has a perfume smell that doesn't appeal to me since I have a low tolerance to certain scents. Highly Scented,Neutral
The tops of my hands suffer with multiple hand washings per day. They get so dry that they crack over the knuckles and none of the creams my dermatologist suggested helped much.  They were thick and oily but they didn't seem to penetrate deeply enough to help. They simply rubbed off and my chapped knuckles were just as dry underneath.Udderly smooth penetrates really well. It penetrates fully in just a few seconds even when you apply a thick layer. It dries to a silky finish rather than a greasy one or a silicone-coated sticky feeling (like Working Hands does).The only thing I don't like is the fragrance which is like baby powder but fairly strong. It would be better unscented for sure. When I want fragrance I use my perfume - and I prefer my lotion not to interfere with the scent. More moisture than greasy lotions but not slick,Neutral
I have been wearing this scent off and on since high school. It is still and will always be one of my all time favorites. It has a light crisp scent that is very unique. It is not overpowering or heavy. It truly reminds me of the ocean with hints of lily.I don't pick up any fruity notes; I would say it is closer to a floral scent. This is certainly a summer or spring time scent. Very refreshing. I read a review of the perfume not lasting long enough.Here are some tips when applying perfume;. Moisturize your skin while damp this will help the perfume stay longer. Allow Moisturizer to absorb and dry. Before dressing spritz on each wrist behind the ear behind the knee and/ or at your elbow. These are pulse points where the natural heat of the skin slowly releases the ingredients in the perfume. Do NOT rub wrists together after you spray this will break down the ingredients in the perfumeIf you follow these steps your scent will stay on all day long. Beautiful Summer Time Scent with Hints of Lily and the Ocean,Neutral
This perfume is so overrated. It smells OK the scent is not lasting and is too subtle. The male scent is far better. It is barely worn. Sorry I bought it over rated,Neutral
By far my all time favorite perfume. I have worn it for years and still get compliments on it. It smells nice and a light scent lingers all day long. Also the scent doesn't clash with the types of scented lotions I wear with it from time to time. Pretty bottle too! My Favorite Perfume,favorite perfume

Sensitive Skin? Check.  Irritated by Perfumes and Scents? Check.  No bad reactions to this product:? CHECK!  I love Olay and their fragrance free products.

I should have known better than to purchase a dish soap that had a high fragrance I thought this would be a nice change and allow me to actually enjoy washing dishes (no dishwasher) yes it smells great but leaves a bad residue which you can taste on everything!! It's especially bad with plastic it soaks up this soap like no other and even when you rinse it a million times you can still taste it. Awful!! And yeah they're not green this stuff gots chemicals too just look it up on ewg.org. Leaves a bad perfumey reside...that you can taste!!,Neutral
Smells exacty like natural lavender which is spicy and herbal versus the overly powerful and too-sweet synthetic/artificial lavender most often used in soaps and perfumes.And that's a good thing.Degreases well for a mostly natural product and sudses well too. Yeah yeah I know. Ionic surfactants can clean without suds but let's face it--tons of suds are cool I like them I want them and any product I use to wash my dishes (along with my hands at the same time) needs to have them. Simply put I won't buy a dish-cleaning product that lacks them.Decently priced for how much you get and how long it lasts this is also available priced similarly at my local GE Markt Distr store and at my Tarjay. Lovely Lavender,Neutral
I've used this product for several years now but it isn't working very well lately.  The main problem is that there's very few bubbles and I found I was having to use more and more product to get my dishes and pans clean.  The consistency appears to be the same but it just doesn't clean.  In fact this is my main complaint with most all of the Mrs. Meyers products I've used.  They smell nice but don't do much beyond that.  I feel like I'm using a product that was devised for a reniassance home - lots of perfume to cover the bad smells but no cleaning power.  What a let down.Update: Thanks Christopher Davis for the confirmation that the formula was changed by the manufacturer.  It was pretty good prior to the change.  Not so much so now.  I still stand by my review! Soap from the Middle Ages,Neutral
Very disappointed in this soap.  The scent is not lemony...it stinks of old lady powdered perfume.  If you know what I mean by an old powdered scent...you'll know what I mean.  You get this on your hands and you will have to smell it for hours.  It's horrible raising food to your mouth with this perfume on your hands.  You can't wash it off either.Besides that after washing a few cups during the day I noticed my hands were now chapped and burning.  The detergents in this soap opened the cuticle of my skin on my hands so horribly that they felt like someone had taken sandpaper to them.Absolutely horrible stuff.  Oh your dishes will smell of this perfume too.  I raised a cup to my mouth to drink coffee and smelled the powdery perfume smell in the cup.  Had to rinse and rinse and rinse.  Never buy again. Scent is overpowering,Neutral
I bought this hand soap after discovering what a joy Mrs. Meyer's housecleaning products are to use.  I love that the company is truly green that they don't use animal products and that there is no harsh chemical smell because they don't use harsh chemicals.  Cleaning whether your home or yourself is all about staying healthy and fresh scent included.  Unfortunately this new parsley scent smells more of an artificial honeydew perfume muddled with something unpleasant that I haven't been able to put my finger on.  If pleasant soaps are one of your small joys in life then this scent is not for you. Smells off,Neutral
I won't send this back but I won't be buying anymore of this particular fragrance. It instantly reminded me of an elderly lady who use to visit us. As other reviewers said it does stick to your hands for a LONG time. It is so overpowering and not in a clean fresh way but in a very strong rose water way.I am middle aged and I would not be caught dead wearing this fragrance on purpose. Smells like old lady perfume,long time

My all time Favorite... Geranium Hand Soap!,Neutral
I really liked the smell of this at first.  It didn't take long however to be overwhelmed by the scent.  Calling it Basil is a stretch.  It just smells sweetly perfumed to me - to the point that you can smell it when someone has washed their hands with it and they walk by you.  I won't buy it again. Perfume,Neutral
No perfumes no dyes no taste.  This is a great lip moisturizer for someone who is looking for something simple and non-irritating.  I apply this less than I did when I used Burt's Beeswax (too minty).  It feels great. yes!,Neutral
Neutrogena lip balm is the same as Chap Stick SPF  without the % petrolatum. Neutrogena is clear none tasting no perfume no wax no PABA which is hard to find otherwise it has the same ingredients of Octinoxate and Oxybenzone. It is great when I am mountain biking but not great )in real hot weather or )surfing in the ocean. For that I use Carmex  in the tube since )tube is the best to hold in the ingredients when melting )nothing offers the protection of the petrolatum in the salty water of the ocean. Carmex is % Vaseline+wax but in a small tube with SPF . No Petrolatum...,Neutral
I bought this along with the DHS Zinc shampoo by advice of my dermatologist.  I have psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin. I can use both with no problems. This product is perfect for the other day shampooing. (I like to switch my shampoo and conditioning every other day) This shampoo does the job cleanses without drying or irritation and that's all I need. I love that it doesn't have any perfumes added. I really hate all those shampoos and conditioners that are so ridiculously overly scented that give me a headache directly out of the shower. Well anyway that enough of my ranting. I just wanted to add a positive post for those of you that are thinking about it but can't make up your mind.  As I said its good for people with sensitivities or that are easily irritated. If you are looking for something high performance shampoo then this may not be the one for you. Perfect for people with sensitivities or scalp irritation.,sensitive skin
Recently my allergies have been out of control and with my symptoms it has meant that I've been itchy... all over.  Even my scalp has been itchy. So I decided to change shampoos. In particular I was looking for a shampoo that was free of scent of unnecessary chemicals.Looking through all of Amazon's offerings my eye landed on DHS Clear Shampoo and the good ratings other customers had given it. And after dithering and consideration I went ahead and made my purchase.I'm pretty happy. I've have used it twice now and while I'm still not entirely itch free elsewhere my scalp is no longer irritated.  I credit the lack of perfumes and colorants and other chemical for my present state of happiness.Definitely recommend you try this if you have an irritated scalp. I saw definitely improvement after the second shampoo.  I'll come back and modify the review after I see how it effects my long hair --dries it out or not. Clean and Clear,Neutral
I bought a bottle of this years ago and just started using it again and fell in love with it all over again. I didn't remember wear I got it nor did I know if they still made it. I found it here by accident and bought more. YAY! The great thing about this oil is that a little goes a long way and it smells delicious. Expensive perfumes just don't have this staying power. How can this be so good but so inexpensive? This has a casual flirty scent that I love for every day. So glad I found this here,long way
This is one of my new favorite perfumes and so inexpensive!  It is intoxicating warm and inviting.  It has a powder smell which is the nature of sandalwood I usually hate any powder smell but this is so very different the vanilla adds a little extra sweetness and softness. I found a store near my house that carries all of the auric blends fragrances and I spent nearly an hour smelling each and every one and ended up buying three that I simply could not live without. They are far superior to any expensive brand name perfume.  I used to work in a perfume shop and nothing I came across can beat the staying power of this perfume oil. I've experimented mixing each of my new scents and every one turns out just as delicious as the original. new favorite,Neutral
This perfume smells really good a slightly sweet floral scent.  The scent is strong enough but not overwhelming.  I like to mix it with the Sandalwood oil to take some of the sweetness down.  The roller ball applicator works well. Egyptian Goddess perfume oil,Neutral
I've smelled versions of Egyptian Goddess before and they always smelled soapy or too much like a stick of incense. Based on the overall positive reviews here (and the price) I decided to try this oil. It's warm sexy and layers nicely with some of my other perfumes (like Boyfriend by Kate Walsh). And I have been getting compliments on it (mostly by women so I'm still uncertain if it appeals to men). I do wish the fragrance lasted longer though. pleased to add this to my collection of favorites,Neutral
I love Auric Blends perfume oils.  I have tried several different scents.  This one is currently my favorite.  It reminds me of Obsession (a Calvin Klein fragrance).  I find that the scent stays with me all day unlike other perfumes I've tried.  Highly recommend this (and all of) Auric Blends product. Love this stuff!!!,Neutral
If your looking to smell good without smelling like you put a bottle of perfume on this is it. Not heavy at all and the scent is perfect I love this more than my Lancome lol Smells so good,Neutral
This perfume is absolutely divine!  I have been trying for years to find a light sweet floral perfume that didn't smell like sickening sweet cotton candy or bubble-gum.  I've found it.  I did a google search a few weeks ago entering in best selling perfume for women and the website Auric Blends came up with Egyptian Goddess listed on the site.  I took a chance.  I had no idea what the perfume would smell like ... I just knew that I needed to try something new and I knew that I did not want to pay $ for a . ounce bottle just in case I hated it.  I decided to try the $ roll on fragrance.  Oh I'm so sorry that I didn't buy the larger bottle now!This oil based perfume is a sweet soft musk smell with floral undertones... the minute I rolled this water of the nile on my wrists my mood lifted tremendously.  I'm a big aromatherapy fan -- love incense and aromatic oils and fragrant soaps... all that great stuff.  This being an oil based perfume will ensure that the fragrance lasts.  Oh I love this stuff so much.  Now I have two favorite perfumes:  Lalique (French) and Egyptian Goddess... I'm in heaven! ;) Oh My Gawd...,Neutral
Review about Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess by DayDream..When I smell this perfume oil product I like smell it's light and stay about hours on my body but on th day when I open this bottle and I don't get any scent smell. I thought I got cold but I asked my family members did you guys smell this?? any scent smell is there? my family members laugh on me so badly and we realized no more scent smell and it's just oil now!! above half of the bottle still remains... I trashed it straight away..don't purchase this product by Day Dream.Yes I got Black opium from vendor name Xtremek that perfume oil still nice smell. I am more purchasing from Xtremek Black opium. but do not buy this Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess from DayDream this is the my bad experience of this product.... I tried similar products in India called Attar from Ratlam Aerochem is company name its nice one but bad luck that I don't get online so I am trying this products now...don't waste money on this Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess by DayDream.Smell gone after couple of days or within days. Just think if you plan to gift someone this product after days???? ugghghhhhh???No smell.. No smell..- Thanks : HP Smell good but after days all smell gone just oil in bottle now...,Neutral
This perfume blend is exotic and sexy but definitely a bit more powerful/heady than I (a light or non-perfume wearer most days) am used to.  I love wearing it on date nights but I recommend starting out light and adding a bit more as needed. My husband really likes the way it smells. Beautiful heady fragrance,Neutral
I have ordered several items from Auric Blends so far and have loved every one of them.  Lover's Moon is my favorite so far.  A light cool floral with staying power.  As with all perfume oils a little goes a long way.  This is a great perfume for a great price.  I hope they keep making them! Love this stuff,long way
I don't know why everyone is complaining about the faint smell. Yes it is faint when you open the bottle cap and sniff it. Once you dab it on you - just a quarter size and let it sit and go into your skin the fragrance will start to grow. Initially when you first buy the perfume you may need to put on about  of it on your body to detect the scent. Then go out for a day or so (walk around in the fresh air) and you'll start to notice the scent. After your nose can delineate between the fresh air and the scent you'll notice that the scent is actually quite strong. Later just a dab will last you  hours - through showers and repeated hand washing / dish washing.This fragrance reminds me of my Kindergarten teachers and older women in their late s up to s wearing this stuff. This is definitely not for women in their s as it smells too motherly and married. It's a comforting sweet scent but it smells old as in a popular scent that we grew up with when we were little so it lends itself as an older woman scent from the last generation. Strong perfume - just a dab and lasts  hours. Not that suitable for s.,Neutral
I have always loved the heady rich and intoxicating scent of Plumeria even though quite honestly florals are not my favorite fragrance type as I prefer mossy woody milky or musky scents.Auric Blends has been a favorite scented roll on oil based fragrance and this scent sure doesn't disappoint. The second I put it on my wrists and neck the rich buttery aroma of Hawaiian Leis envelops my senses and puts me in a good mood. This morning as I got to work I quickly dabbed some one and my new coworkers started asking what that scent was and how good it smelled and I sit feet away yet it bursts with luxurious bouquet of freshness. Plumeria is an incredible scent all in it's own but this oil really makes me appreciate the fine craftsmanship of true artisans of perfumery. MMeeow yummy!,Neutral
Although this is probably considered more of a female-oriented scent (it reminds me a little bit of baby powder) I find the Auric Blends brand of African Musk to be both incredibly sensuous and yet very clean (not overly heavy). It's a light musky and somewhat powder-y scent which I actually dab on the back of my neck and arms when I'm working out at my stinky gym (I wouldn't wear this at work).  I find that it doesn't end up smelling like a heavy body spray when I'm working out (and I've had more than a few folks tell me they really liked it).  It smells like a VERY light version of musk incense that street vendors sell but much nicer.Although a particular perfume scent is hard to describe if you do see this being sold anywhere else try the sample bottle. I actually bought my first bottle about  years ago for $ from a street vendor in NYC who was also selling incense but I haven't seen Auric Blends being sold on the street in awhile so I've been buying here at Amazon. Price here is good too. About $. cheaper than what I've seen online at other places. Lighter (powder-y) African musk.....,little bit
Purchased  roll-on fragrances in / oz bottle size: Majic (ok) Africian Musk (better) Forbidden Desire (ok) Egyptian Goddess (weak not ok) Black Coconut (ok).  Not particularly impressed.  Too much carrier oil and not enough of the perfume scent.  So you have to use more of the fragrance (/ oz won't last long).  The shipment was fast was wrapped well and the bottle/dispensers work very well.  I just wish the scents were more powerful.  Maybe I should try a few different scents... Scents are a bit on the weak side,Neutral
With an inexpensive perfume brand like Auric you can generally expect to find one or two scents done surprisingly well amid a lot of scents that are mediocre or frankly bad. Egyptian Goddess is a cult favorite because it falls under done surprisingly well and is a decent straightforward Egyptian style musk without a lot of frills.It wears pretty close to the skin and is light without being sharp or soapy ever so slightly nutty evocative of clean skin with emphasis on skin rather than clean. The musk is accompanied by some quiet and unobtrusive woods and spices that are hard to pick out (which in this case means they're doing their job well). It's a truly unisex fragrance. Fans of Egyptian Goddess would probably enjoy Special Delivery from the small soapery Dirty Sanchez Soaps on Etsy; it's an extremely similar musk.Side note: almost every musk oil fragrance on Amazon has its share of disappointed reviews from people insisting the product smells like nothing at all. Musk scents are created by several different types of molecules and interestingly some people are anosmic to these molecules -- simply can't smell them. It's sort of the olfactory equivalent of colorblindness I guess. And people who can smell one kind of musk molecule just fine can still be anosmic to other kinds of musk. So it's not the product it's just that the people leaving one-star reviews literally can't smell the perfume. Surprisingly good quality at the price,Neutral
So disappointed with this perfume oil. You are paying for a bottle of oil with very little scent in it. This oil is so diluted and weak. It smells amazing in the bottle but once applied the scent is gone in a couple minutes. Auric needs to really increase the scent to oil ratio. Until then I would not purchase again sadly. very weak product,Neutral
Upon arrival the bag that was containing the perfume was drenched with leaked oil. The writing on the bottle had rubbed off. Other than that the scent is great and lasts a long time. Maybe you will have better luck than me. Fairly good product.,long time
I ordered the Egyptian Goddess roll on perfume from Amazon just based solely off of reviews.  I'm really picky with scents but I decided..what the heck it's a great price and I can't go wrong.  I'm glad I did because I absolutely love the scent.  I was curious about the other scents they have so I went to the Auric Blends website.  They have tons of awesome sounding fragrances!  There are so many to choose from!  They make them all sound so tempting so I splurged and ordered $ worth of samples.  I know that is kinda crazy and extreme but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do.  I'm so glad my husband gets me. :)  It was so much fun opening up all of the samples and trying them on.  I can't say enough good things about this company and their quality natural perfume oils!  Even though I love Egyptian Goddess I like all of the other scents too just depending on my mood.  Hey it's a girl thing!  I have to say that the Water Lily fragrance is my second favorite! The best natural perfumes around!,Neutral
i was leery to try this perfumew/all purchases via internetu can't try before you buy which can certainly lead to regretfu purchase..However i was very pleased w/this oil. EGYPTIAN GODDESS is so many things. In reading reviews alot said it smelled different on everydayi haven't experienced that but the scent is  i quite enjoy& i'm looking forward to purchasing a larger bottle as well as solid perfume(when available). My ONLY drawback was that some reviewers stated to only buy from Auric Blends i've no prob w/this&thought I HAD but when i recieved perfume in mail the order invoice stated it came fromOLD GLORYi've no prob w/O.G.it just troubles me that i clicked on Auric Blends in order to be sure the E.G.oil was the real thing&still ended up getting it from elsewhere.It still smells great but i WILL make sure to have a witness for my next purchase lol! Enjoy this perfume oilit begs to be wornshared&experienced..just be careful in crowded placesyou may find yourself overwhelmed! amazing......subliminal....magic..,Neutral
This is a very light and soft scent that is NOT floral. Sandalwood is definitely the more dominant of the two lending a powdery and airy quality to the fragrance. The vanilla is more subtle and comes to the top more throughout the day as you wear the fragrance.This scent is not in the least offensive and it would be difficult to put on too much. As I said this scent is reminiscent of a luxurious body powder. It would be perfect for a teenager who wants to enter the world of perfume. Auric Blends are very high quality oils. Light and soothing,Neutral
I found this perfume oil in a store called Success Express in NJ when I was visiting family one year.  I absolutely love it!! It's warm and soft with a light scent that isn't over powering or headache inducing.  I recently ran out and my Mom sent me a package with a bottle in it as a surprise.  I was so happy to have more...I've been milking my last bottle.  I highly recommend trying this product or any other auric blends product.  Very good quality for a good price. BEST PERFUME OIL EVER!,Neutral
This is a scented OIL so take it easy (this is in response to the reviewer that said it is overpowering)... it doesn't evaporate like perfume sprays so the fragrance stays put for some time.  Black Coconut doesn't smell purely like coconut... this oil smells like the most yummy tanning oil you could ever imagine.  It smells like you are drenched in sunlight on some glorious white sand beach.  I adore this scent.  It's fantastic soothing and sexy all at once. Aaaaaaah..... so beachy,Neutral
I have to say this is my second Auric Blends scent purchase and I am now addicted. For only $ and you get an amazing smelling totally unique perfume oil that lasts all day?? Where can you go wrong?! This one smells very sweet like flowers and a sweet ball of cotton candy while you're being hugged by a maternal figure (if that had a scent!) Not my favorite scent but still amazing and long lasting! Xxx WOW!,Neutral
This is a heavenly clean smell that I will continue to use forever -  and it's true a little touch of it is all you need and it lasts all day! best perfume ever!,Neutral
I decided to purchase this perfume based on the great reviews written but unfortunately it is just was not what I was hoping for. The scent is so light I feel as if I have to literally douse myself to smell anything.  I am suspecting that the item that I got is an old batch. Not what I expected...,Neutral
Take the cap off and sniff and you'll get a light whiff of this perfume. Not bad really. But roll it on and the scent disappears. I've used it several times and the result is the same...nothing. I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin. I am aware that an individual's personal chemistry can affect perfumes but I expect some scent even if different once applied. Disappointing to say the least and I am afraid I cannot recommend this product. Very little scent straight from the bottle,Neutral
I recently purchased an organic bath wash which had honey almond in it.  It smelled so great that I wanted something else with the scent. This was great!  I love to wear designer perfumes but I also like simple fragrances as well.  This oil goes a long way and has a great smell.  I have used it many times for the last month and the bottle still looks completely filled.  I think it will last for a long time.  Great purchase and excellent price. Great subtle scent,long time
I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint and that you couldn't smell the fragrance.  I should have paid attention to it.  But having said that I am also one who likes a strong fragrance.  This one is extremely mild but pleasant.  It's a pleasant fragrance I just should have saved my money.  I just assumed maybe it was just the difference in chemistry and maybe it would work for me....it didn't. I should have listened!!!,Neutral
This is really awesome. I wasnt expecting too much from an eight dollar fragrance but damn this is like on eof the best perfumes Ive ever had and Im a vet at fragrances Im a perfume junkie!!Especially oils and Ive used the best! From Kuumba Made to Madinni and Possets I Love perfume oils and this is the best one!Its not fake smelling or synthetic smelling at all and its very subtle and awesome almost like an invisible perfume and it lasts all day. You dont need alot and I catch these whiffs of it thruout the day and its fabulous Love it!! I was amazed at all the good reviews all over the internet and decided I cant go wrong and they are right it is awesome! omg...,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfumes.  It is very feminine without be sweet or very strong. It is a floral scent. This is my third bottle and these little bottles last for months even using it daily.  The Auric Blends brand is made from high quality oils and don't change their scent as you wear them or fade. Even though perfume is a very personal item and you can't tell what a scent is like without smelling it I would recommend the Auric Blends line as well as Night Queen in particular. It is high quality perfume oil at a price you can experiment with until you find what you like. One of my favorite scents.,Neutral
Majik- I know the product says &#;A deep and earthy scent with a touch of sweet.  Myrrh adds a rich sweetness and amber brings a touch of spice.&#; But most amber scents are sweeter this is spicy almost peppery. I'm not in love with it but I think my Mom would like it. So I'm giving it to her as a stocking stuffer.I do however love how long the scent stays on you I put some on my wrist a while ago and as I type I can smell it very well! The scent definitely reminds me of the holidays because of the spice almost like a yummy burning candle or wax diffuser. I would love the scent as one of those but not as my perfume. But we all have different taste! I think it's a good quality product. Would be better as a candle fragrance,Neutral
Which is why im giving it  stars. I personally think it smells like old lady perfume. Once my mother reminded me I remembered that she used to wear this perfume when I was younger ( her and a few other women). It even made her reminisce about the days she used to wear this before she had children. This is the second Auric blends roll on ive tried that I do not like ( the first was the vanilla) and have given to my mother(she seems to like them a lot and they even smell different on her). Uh..my mother liked this one too...,Neutral
I get what I wanted. Sandalwood scent. It fits perfectly for my use which is to layer it with other perfumes. I'm not sure why other people cannot smell anything. My bottle is great. Very nice,Neutral
I love this perfume. It smells so good. I love to put it on especially after a bath or shower. Has strong staying power so you don't need to apply it often. Love this stuff!,Neutral
What can I say this perfume is amazing!  It's rich spicy sexy and very womanly.  It's a mature scent without being old lady-ish.  Think sultry bombshell draped in rich brocades and silks. Positively intoxicating,Neutral
I love Opium oils I am out and probably have to purchase some more this is the company to go to for that smokey oil I love it. Love this Perfume...,Neutral
I just simply do not like the smell of this oil.  Different body chemistries make the fragrance different on everybody so you should probably try for yourself.  After I first apply it the smell is like that of Opium perfume.  Unfortunately on me it morphs into a body odor smell shortly afterward.  I didn't realize at first that it was the perfume oil and was concerned that I was having a sweating problem (even though I was not sweating and I shower at least once a day) - after smelling my wrists repeatedly I realized it was the perfume oil.  I am going to give this to a friend to try I hope it works better for her.  I won't be ordering this fragrance again. Morphs into a smell of body odor,Neutral
I've bought oils for the past  years everywhere from the bazaars of Saudi Arabia to the fine perfumiers in Paris and the French Quarter in New Orleans and have always been a fan of oils vs perfumes. For years I've made my own scents from oils mixed with various carriers as well. Disappointingly weak single note fragrance doesn't last long at all..maybe a half hour...poor quality and very weak. At this rate it'll be gone in a few days. Not a good value for the $$$ would not buy again. Weak Scent,Neutral
This is a great smelling perfume oil.  I cannot describe the scent other than to say it stays close to the skin and is very sexy.  This particular line of products are all wonderful. Smells Good,Neutral
No fault of the seller- my perfume oil sat for four days at a USPS facility within twenty miles of my home.  Finally it was delivered I get to try the product.  Goes on strong but does not last.  Each persons body chemistry is different this could be one of the reasons for the scent of the oil dissipating within an hour. I had to keep re-applying the oil.  Fragrance is nice I wish it would last on my body longer.Would I place another order (??????) I do not know . Goes on Strong - Dissipates,Neutral
Ive bought several of the Auric Blends perfumes and loved them but this one I just don't like it.  More of a masculine scented oil bordering on aged powder.Its not a disgusting scent just not what I thought it would be.It would probably smell nice on an older gentleman though. Not quite for me,Neutral
I'm running low on my signature perfume and I want to experiment with different fragrances but don't want to spend a crazy amount of money. Auric Blends perfume oils are perfect for this purpose. You may be able to find these at health food stores wicca shops even in a farmer's market; but the easiest place to find them is here. It's a bit of a gamble to buy things like fragrances online especially if you don't get a chance to sample smells but for $ or $ a bottle it's worth it. And if you don't like the smell you can always give it to a friend.I bought Black Opium and Majik and I really like both. Here's what they smell like:Black Opium- A floriental with touches of vanilla & patchouli smells absolutely intoxicating you can't go wrong trying it. It reminds me of a perfume my mom had but I can't put my finger on it. It's gonna be one of my regulars. This is probably how Stevie Nicks smells--in a good way!Majik- A sweet woodsy earthy smell with touches of amber & myrhh. When I first smelled it it smelled kinda soapy but on my skin it was sweet and a little spicy with vague touches of cinnamon. It's not for everybody some may consider it headshoppy but it's a unique scent and I like it.Keep in mind that these scents will develop over the course of a few weeks so give it a little time if you're not sure you like it. I love that these are quality long-lasting perfume oils with no alcohol or chemicals. The packaging is also very convenient; a small and portable bottle and the rollerball doesn't leak. These are great perfumes at a great price and I look forward to trying more :) Gives cheap perfume a whole new meaning!,Neutral
It does remind me a bit of the well-known perfume Opium which I loved. It has a very strong scent so I would recommend that you try just a little at first. For the low price it is quite nice. It makes me feel a bit sexy which isn't easy when you are my age!! My husband doesn't like strong scents though so it would make his eyes water and nose plug up but not with endearing emotion! Black Opium perfume oil,Neutral
I wanted to love Auric Blends based on everything I had read and accidently stumbling onto their perfume oils here I decided to order three different scents based on their website descriptions. This scent Black Opium is decent I suppose but only by comparison with the others that were horrible failures Majik and Egyptian Goddess. This is the only scent that actually smells okay and stays on you for a few hours. I had hopes of ordering - others but based on these three I will not be buying anymore Auric Blends. Not what I was expecting,Neutral
I usually forget to put on lotion but this smells so good and goes on so smoothly I always remember. I use it instead of perfume because it smells better than the (expensive) scent I have. Great product,great product
First let me say that I adore this lotion in addition to the Tuscan Honey I also have it in Vanilla and Mago Beach II.This review is strictly for the Tuscan Honey fragrance - which isn't my favorite scent.The Tuscan Honey has sweet honey undertones buried beneath a strange perfume that is heavy and un-appealing.The lotion itself absorbs quickly but it does leave a powdery  feel in its wake. Not my favorite scent,Neutral
I have loved this lotion for years and was so sad when a local store stopped carrying it. The scent is light and feminine and goes well as a fragrance alone or many feminine perfumes such as Tatiana. It is not greasy feeling and absorbs immediately and truly makes your skin feel silky and smell beautiful. Seller was prompt ith delivery and the price is a great bargain. I will buy this again from this person! Camille Beckman -Camille Lotion,Neutral
I got a slightly different assortment of things in my kit: I got a Lemon scented Vitamin E bath and body oil orange essence soap and peppermint soap instead of whatever that are in the kit sold here.I would say that my favorite is the banana hand creme! That just smells way too good-- it smells better than a banana in fact it smells like banana bread fresh out of the oven! I put this stuff on like every other hour just to sniff it. Thats why I went and got a full sized = )The soaps are kind of small they go quickly...but I love the peppermint one.The cuticle creme I would say is the most useful because I also use it as lip balm (if you compare the ingredients with their lip balm it's not that different) and it works well on lips because it smells delicious and is very thick.  I don't have problems with my cuticles but I imagine it would work well on those too. Seriously that little tin of creme lasts a LONG time.The milk and honey stuff is my second favorite I also went and got a full sized bottle of that. It seems watery at first but it forms into a nice protective thick creme as soon as you spread it around and it leaves my face and body soft for hours. It also smells like heaven my cat keeps wanting to drink it.The honey lip balm...ugh. I cannot stand the strong perfume-ish musky smell. It does not smell that natural to me. I gave it to my bf and he likes it (thats what boyfriends are for ^_^).The hand salve is useless. I would say that's the only thing in there that could be replaced. It does not smell good and it is way to greasy.The lemon scented oil works very well on dry skin better than the honey milk lotion so I am using it carefully = )Over all this would make a great treat for yourself or your loved one. Good stuff,dry skin
It smells bad doesn't work smells like the worst cheap perfume ever and I just can't get over the smell. IT made me wanna puke. ew,Neutral
Scented soaps just like perfumes and colognes are a subjective matter and as such; I cannot actually criticize or say this is a bad soap because in and of itself- it is a quality soap-just too strongly scented.If you like Patchouli or know others who do and would like to consider this as a  something for your personal use or a gift keep in mind that this soap bar is heavily scented.I bought it and the response from those who used it was that the scent was too overpowering for their taste(it actually permeated one floor of the home after someone used it in a shower).Now- if you like this scent and you like it on the strong side- this could  be a good thing.If you like it more subtle than this bar of soap is going to smell overpowering to you.All in all- if you consider buying this think of the Patchouli scent and how strong you enjoy its essence because this brand is  definitely not subtle. Popular with some- too pungent for others,Neutral
Natural not heavy greasy and doesn't have a perfume odor.  The only drawback is that it stings a bit when getting too close to eye. Very nice,Neutral
Thick cream which is helpful for my dry skin but the fragance is too strong in cheap way. Jason needs to make this product without any perfume scent. I use this to supplement my primary moisturizer. It's only been about  weeks but I haven't noticed any effect to my skin. Overall I prefer their Vitamin E cream. the scent ruins it,dry skin
Every November my hands begin to crack.  I found Burt's Bees hand salve about four years ago and have faithfully purchased a tin each fall because it is the only product that I have found that can assuage the discomfort and help my hands heal.The consistency is somewhat greasy but the product spreads easily over hands.  The product is absorbed within five minutes of application.  I typically apply at night and in the morning.  This routine keeps my hands moisturized and soft.I am very sensitive to perfumes.  This hand salve has a distinctive scent but one that is very herbal in nature.  The smell can fill a room or work office but I don't think the scent rises to the level of being obnoxious.  I regularly apply it at work and have had no complaints.  Typically the scent dissipates in twenty minutes.  If you are worried about the stares of colleagues try to apply it after a nighttime shower.A little bit of this product goes a long way and a three ounce tin typically takes me through winter and spring.  I like that Amazon offers the two pack so I can keep one at work and one at home.Overall a fantastic product that is highly recommended. A yearly cold weather purchase,long way
I wash my hands a lot (kids chores cleaning etc) and I have naturally dry skin anyway so during the winter my cuticles and fingertips will often crack from being so dry. This product works wonders lasts through handwashing smells good (no chemical smell) and uses natural ingredients. I'm very sensitive to heavy perfumes and this salve has a pleasant smell like natural honey-beeswax.If you have cracked hands give this one a try. I find that it works even better than vaseline. The Best Product for Ragged Cuticles and Cracked Fingertips,dry skin
This product works well for a regular facial wash. I do not suffer from acne but I do have combo skin that has been leaning on the dry side lately. I used this every day one bottle lasted a while. It is one of the better products I've used. I only have an issue or two. One is that it smells strange. It's supposed to be a natural product so there are no dyes or perfumes (not the issue). Another issue I had is that it made my face awesomely dry.I owned a set so I immediately had to follow up with the Aloe toner; if I didn't my dry spots would flake.  I followed up with moisturizer (night time cream) that I used for both the day and evening. Overall I feel the brand is average and while my skin had no irritations I don't feel there was any huge improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. Average Facial Cleanser,Neutral
This is one of the first eye creams I have ever enjoyed using without getting red eyes itching or discomfort. I had stopped using any eye creams due to unpleasant red eyes.It goes on and disappears does not migrate into the eye.  The small bottle with a pump is great for not contaminating the product and also getting out just a bit at a time. Light and without any perfumes. I have used it as an over all face moisturizer under make up while traveling (reduce the number of things I need to take with me). It works well for that also.I would recommend it as a good product at a rational price. Very comfortable eye cream,Neutral

I use this product on my natural african american hair and it is great. It adds much needed moisture to my hair.The scent of this product is not good. It smells like really cheap perfume and like someone has sprayed A LOT of it.My only other critique is that this bottle is very poorly made. When you spritz it goes everywhere so I have to pour this product into another (effective) spritz bottle. Smells a bit like cheap perfume but it is effective for adding moisture.,Neutral
Best fragrance ever!!!!!! One of the greatest body scrub's out there.  I use this at least twice a week to exfoliate and moisturize my over sunned legs arms and shoulders.  This is wonderful for winter dry skin and summer sun and pool chemical skin treatment.  For the price--this product cannot be beat--It is every bit as good as the high dollar scrubs--and I have tried them all--and always come back this.  I hate to brag about how great it is too much--because I selfishly do not want the price to go up:-  This fragrance blends perfectly with the body lotion and perfume & perfume I use.  It is a soft fragrance.  I think Lavender is a fragrance recommended for helping in relaxation:-  I get compliments after using this on the glow of my skin and the fragrance.  Do be careful as it does make the tub and shower a bit slippery.  Thank you for offering. Perfect fragrance-wonderful scru,Neutral
I have really enjoyed this toner.  It has a light fresh smell.  I noticed some complained about the scent being too strong.  I am typically pretty sensitive about scents and don't like most women's colognes/ perfumes.  I found this scent to be very pleasant and light.  This toner  is very mild and makes skin feel nice and fresh with zero drying effect.  Very gentle.  Highly recommend and will continue to purchase/use for myself. No other toner will do now....,Neutral
I am truly impressed with this product. I have struggled with both dry and acne-prone skin since I was a teenager (I'm  now). I've tried all sorts of acne treatments and toners that tend to dry out my skin while not really seeming to alleviate the acne. I continued to have regular breakouts - times a week.I tried this product after hearing about it on youtube and I couldn't be happier with the results. Not only has this controlled my breakouts but I can also tell that my skin is smoother and brighter looking! Since the product is alcohol free it doesn't have the drying effect of most toners but it's also effective at removing my makeup and keeping my acne at bay. I now only use this and Cetaphil cleanser which really seems to contribute to the improvement in my complexion. I will admit that I'm not a fan of the rose/ granny perfume scent but I'm eager to try more of the formulations that Thayer's offers (aloe and lavender).I highly recommend this for anyone suffering from acne and/or uneven skin tone. Amazing results,dry skin
Thayer's makes one of the best Witch Hazel. This one is no exception with a lovely natural perfume of pressed rose petals and an added moisturizer from the aloe vera.  I use this everyday and is a must-have in my low-maintenance sulfate-free morning wash regimen.  I recommend to anyone that wants to tone his/her skin without stripping the natural oils. The best all-natural Toner,Neutral
I love the smell of this toner!  Yes it's roses but a subtle rose instead of a fake perfume rose.  I also like the moisturizing qualities.  I do still experience breakouts using this toner but I usually have to follow with a mild acne cream regardless of what toner I use.  I'd rather use this toner any day over the acne toners that dry my sensitive skin.  I took one star off because I find it leaves a mild film and slight shine on my skin but since I use it at night it's not a big issue. Moisturizing and smells divine!,sensitive skin
best.  smell.  ever.  Can they make this into a perfume please?  Light and refreshing.  I opened it and stood sniffing the bottle for about  minutes.  Works nicely to tighten pores and refresh.

PLEASE make it into a non-toxic perfume for me !!!!! best. smell. ever.,Neutral
this is the best perfume in the world i absolutly love it and so does my boyfriend yea its a little spendy but completely worth it :) the best,Neutral
I've purchased this particular perfume at department stores for a few years now since the fragrance smells great (fresh doesn't make you want to sneeze) and decided to get it from Amazon since it was cheaper. It doesn't smell exactly like the one in stores (although it smells similar) which makes me think it could be fake (or watered down??). The perfume fades quickly which is strange since I've only needed a spray or two of this perfume in the past and it stays on for a long time. I wouldn't buy this from Amazon again and wouldn't recommend anyone buy this from Amazon. Might not be the real thing,long time
This is a really great perfume. It's floral but not overpoweringly so. It smells clean too. Wonderful smell,Neutral
Ralph Lauren's Ralph is one of the best perfumes i have EVER bought! It not only smells GREAT but the bottle is absolutley charming.  It is worth every penny because it really DID stay on all day! I reccomend you buy it as soon as possible. Ralph Lauren Ralph AMAZING,Neutral
This is my most favorite perfume ever. It has a distinct sent that is very hard to explain. I have been looking for this forever and so glad it was on here!!! Best ever,favorite perfume

I take a lot of medication because of my disabilities.  Several of the medications have the side effect of drying my skin.  If not treated the skin begins to crack which brings the danger of infection.  Usually the biggest problem is my hands.  For various reasons I wash my hands many times a day (one day I counted twenty times).  Every time I washed my hands I make my skin dryer.So my physician told me to find a body wash that is not soap.  Most products that I found were body washes with drying agents and perfume. The bars of soap that I found mostly emphasized chemicals to remove the products of hard dirty labor.  The few exceptions were beauty bars that were full of lotions (usually with alcohol which dries the skin).Then I heard about Basis but could not find it in my stores.Recently I found Basis on Amazon.  Basis does not have perfumes or dyes so I do not need to worry about reactions to chemicals.  Basis also avoids drying agents.  With Basis I need only watch the moisture lost due to toweling and chemicals in the water.Using Basis  almost eliminates drying of my skin.  Basis contains camomile and aloe vera so it is very gentle.  I highly recommend Basis  especially for people with dry skin. Cleansing Bar,dry skin
I was looking for a dual-purpose rose water and I have realized after the fact that what I really need is a true hydrosol. Since I read the consistently high ratings for this brand at the time though and the budget friendly price I decided to go with this one. I received it yesterday and used it last night in my face cleaning routine. The smell is okay. Maybe I just don't like roses as much as the next person. It was by no means offensive but I personally wouldn't want to wear a perfume that smelled like this. I transferred this into a fine-mist spray bottle and spritzed it on after cleaning my face and neck and applying Hyaluronic Acid and before my moisturizer. Since I have several steps in fighting the melasma wrinkles and adult acne my face gets dry by the time I'm ready to put on my moisturizer. I will definitely continue to use it as it does seem to keep the dryness at bay while I go through my routine. It is refreshing on the skin and I had no negative reaction to it.For the dual-purpose part: I had Lasik eye surgery  years ago and I've been suffering from extremely dry eyes for about two years. I wanted something without all the synthetic ingredients that all the OTC drops have. Many people have commented that rose water drops are very good for dry eyes. Turns out this rose water is just distilled water with rose essential oil added. I need to do some further research but I don't think this is going to work. For skin moisturizing purposes though it's fits the bill. Still on the fence on this stuff,Neutral
I LOVE this. I have been using it for years to spritz on my face throughout the day when my skin feels dry or oily and I don't have time to wash it and it's very refreshing. I also use it after I apply my makeup to set my powder foundation. It smells lovely. I can't handle &#;real&#; perfumes (not that this product is really trying to be a perfume at all) because I am sensitive to strong lingering scents and they usually give me headaches. So I use this instead for a natural little spritz of scent that is refreshing lifts my spirits and isn't too strong. Makes me happy. And no chemicals or yucky stuff that I try to avoid. A staple for me for years!,Neutral
I adore the scent of roses. My family has a special connection to it and it always makes me smile. There is a very calming quality to the scent which is probably why people use it in aromatherapy. Heritage Products has a wonderful product in their rose water. It has a delicate note to it without being overpowering. What's more if you are having a skin allergy/redness of any kind just dab a small amount on a cotton ball and it resolves your issues while leaving you feeling as fresh as a rose garden. I like to drip a few drops on my clothing and my pulse points. Highly recommended and a little goes a long way. A terrific toner astringent and perfume....,long way
I love the scent; I bought it  for use as a facial toner but it's strong enough to use as a perfume splash. Highly scented which could be a good or bad thing.,Neutral
Great product I use it in my hair. Its healthy and it smells wonderful too. Between you and I I've used it as a quickie perfume too. In that capacity it's not an all day thing but the first couple of hours got me complements. Great Product,great product
I like to use the rose water in spritzes when I do my twist outs. It leaves my hair not only smelling great but nice and soft. It also enhances the curliness of my twist outs. I'm ready to buy more of this!The rose water sold by Heritage has no unnatural ingredients in it. There isn't an artificial rose scent added to make it smell like roses while not containing actual roses. This brand uses mainly European roses -- I believe. It is also made organically. I was surprised also to not have an allergic reaction to this brand of rose water when I have sensitivities to perfumes. Great for homemade spritzes for maintaining your curls,Neutral
I love using rose water and glycerin as a moisturizer...and love just using rose water as a toner and perfume. But wish it came in a spray bottle instead of a squeeze bottle...I know this probably helps keep the cost downbut would be so much more convenient. Heavily scented...if you love the smell of roses as I do (reminds me of my grandmother) then I highly recommend this for you. Very nice for the price just wish it came in a spray bottle,Neutral
This is really good lotion for hairstylists ! It really soaks into the skin and keeps your hands soft. I mixed it with a little of this Victoria secret lotion  just a tad because that one is too perfumey so when I mix it with the skin trip it calms it down and makes it softer I will be ordering more when I run out I love it . The scent alone is good too tho. I love coconut I was just bored one day and decided to mix it :) good stuff,Neutral
If you like Bath and Body Works or youthful smells similar to that you'll HATE this. I stupidly thought it would smell good based on other reviews. DUMB! It smells WORSE than Estee Lauder and that grandma stench. I kept it on for a while at home and thought that horrible smell would fade leaving a not so bad smell. Nope. I had to wash it off my wrist after a while because it was so bad.  BAD I SAY!!Don't do what I did and buy perfume you've not smelled. Once I find a post office I'm sending this sucker back. I'm going back to Bath and Body Works and Victoria's Secret for perfume. This was disgusting. Worst perfume EVER!!,Neutral
I didn't know if I would like this as I normally prefer very clean or single-flower scents.  I don't like Opium-type spicy perfumes. However when I got this earlier today I did NOT sniff it straight from the bottle.  After reading dozens and dozens of reviews on it I knew that it had to warm up to my body chemistry before I would know what it really did for me.  I lifted my hair and sprayed a little on the back of my neck.  A few hours later I can tell you that I absolutely LOVE this!  It smells great and has a bit of a clean tone to it.  I intend to stick with this one.  :-) I didn't know if I would like it,Neutral
This is one of those perfumes you must test for yourself before buying or you are destined to be dissapointed.  I bought a sample vial because I read so many good reviews and am glad I only spend three dollars! This stuff reeks! This is worse than grandma scent its nauseating. I asked my husband what he thought and his response was: Phew! What the hell is that?Yeah. It does last a very long time but what's the use. Awful,long time
A completely unnecessary and strong stench: perfume I guess is what some people call it. I have seen estimates that as much as a quarter of the population is sensitive to these scents; some know it and some don't realize what is causing their sneezing coughing choking watering eyes headaches feelings of malaise difficulty breathing (!) etc. So why put scent in a product that is supposed to color hair? I didn't see it listed as an ingredient on the package; otherwise I would not have spent my money on it. Only when I used it and had to ride in a closed vehicle with someone else who is very sensitive to this allergen did I realize the strong unwelcome addition to something that was supposed to cover the gray not somehow change my odor.I THINK it does work to color the wisps of white hair I'm getting. But of course now I can't use it again. I suggest looking elsewhere for a product that won't make people sick. Colors somewhat but contains a stench,Neutral
I am in love with this perfume it smells so sweet and so sweet the bottle is pink and cute!! I get many compliments on this perfume!! Smells Wonderful!! Sweet!,Neutral
I purchased this and used it for one cycle.  days really...I believe I missed a day.  During this time (pre-period) I didnt experience any improvement in sleep quality nor in acne breakouts (which generally bother me before my period begins.  I am not entirely sure WHAT benefits I experienced. I chose to skip this cycle and will re-start next month as I travelled and missed the start date (after ovulation) to use it for December.  The scent is ok. Nothing perfumey really...infact...it smells a bit medicinal but it fades away in less than mins. (For reference: Am . Not menopausal at all. Have a regular cycle. Chose to try this to balance hormones to seek clearer skin...naturally.) Not Sure Yet....,Neutral
One of the best anti-bacterial and viral on the market. This soap handles many problems associated with aging which is a bacterial problem.  Neem Oil not the kind for insect protection read the ones on how the Neem oil works in soaps & salve.  Neemaura Skin Salve and Thera Neem Leaf shampoo & skin lotion.  Most folks do not understand that you must detox your bod as you age and their are  different types of bacteria on the OUTSIDE of your body.  Two of which if allowed inside can kill you. While there is somewhat of a order that lingers I do not find it offensive.  What offenses are women who ware perfume to the guy. This soap also need to be tough to kill bacteria and so folks with sensitive skin should use on the backsides and legs and areas that are not so sensitive.  You will find itching is significantly reduced when these products products are used. Another must have in you 'aging kit' is Redmond Clay is also a fantastic product NOT TO BE WITHOUT. Great stuff would like to see this product go auto ship.,sensitive skin
Excellent buying experience very good choice of perfume because perfectly fulfills my needs its aroma is exquisite durable citrus and fruity type an entire show to smell perfect for gift giving or for personal use. .. Delivery time and attention was correct. thanks! Excellent,Neutral
Ordered this as a gift for a friend who is in love with this particular fragrance. She practically bathes in perfume so I had to get her the large version. Timeless scent,Neutral
I just love the intermediate scent that lies between perfume and cologne. This smells fresh and springy like taking a super clean shower. I just love how light and refreshing this smells and it's great for everyday use. Fresh,Neutral
I have certain perfumes for certain occasions. This I use before working out or when I'm feeling sporty in general. Smells &#;eh&#; in the bottle but smells damn delicious on the body. A classic clean scent. So Yummy,Neutral
I love this perfume and the price was awesome...I have paid more for it in the past and since I have amazon prime it was a great deal. love the scent,Neutral
I got a bad bottle. It didn't smell like it was supposed to and dried down to a horrible waxy smell like an unscented deodorant.It's irritating that Amazon won't let me return it! bad perfume,Neutral
This is a unique feminine scent with notes of powder flowers vanilla and something else...maybe almonds? Whatever it is the effect is great. It's a subtle fragrance that's very different from most mainstream perfumes. Sadly the staying power isn't that great though. Good scent poor staying power,Neutral
Shopping for perfume is always a pain coz there are so many of them and you might come across more than  of them that you really like. It's hard to pick. But this one is different because it's different from any other perfume and it's got very distinctive smell and it just pops up among  others and you know it's your favorite.I always wanted to get one but i was not too satisfied with the price in the malls and I just recently found it on amazon and decided to buy it. The shipping was fast and I'm really really looking forward to it.I really really like vanilla and I also like Burberry Brit a lot but after comparing these two I decided to pick this one coz it's more unique and less common. it's excellent!,Neutral
Reminds me of a room fragrance plug-in like the Kitchen or Caramel or Sugar Cookie scents from Bath & Body Work or Yankee Candle but more layered & sophisticated. I would love this as a home fragrance spray especially in late Fall and through to the holidays. But for me personally I can't stand it as a perfume.That said I love two other Hanae Mori scents - Couture and Mystical Moon. Better as a plug-in air freshner,Neutral
Live this perfume.  vanilla and sweet.  I will use this often because I get many compliments  when I wear it. Fragrant,Neutral
It takes a lot to get me to spend more than  bucks on something for my beauty routine and if you've actually convinced me to spend that  bucks I probably have a coupon hidden away somewhere to make the cost less! But when a friend started raving about Hope in a Jar and all the good things it does for her skin I was tempted to try it and was able to find a small jar for only $. at my local Sephora store. I cannot tell you how fast I was hooked onto this moisturizer!I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts along my chin and I've tried tons of different moisturizing products but all are too heavy and/or greasy for someone with an oil issue. This one is super light and non-greasy and absorbs into my skin within just a minute or two rather than the - minutes I would wait with the heavier creams. I only use the tiniest bit each day so this really small jar has already lasted me about  months and it's not even / of the way gone.I liked the scent it wasn't perfumey or overly medicinal it just smelled like unscented lotion which was nice. And though it doesn't matter for the use of the product the styling of the jar is cool and modern which makes these Philosophy products great for gifts.My only complaint is that this particular formula does not include sunscreen. I've since been informed that there is a High Performance formula that includes SPF  but it's more expensive. Sunscreen is pretty necessary these days and most moisturizing products and makeup products automatically come with it so that was disappointing.Other than that I'm very happy with my purchase. Definite value for the money,Neutral
Not for Sensitive Skins-- Perfume is UnnecessaryWhy would a company put such a heavy perfume in a facial moisturizer? It seems that the majority of the negative reviews are because of the odor.I usually use Clinique or Bare Minerals which is completely fragrance-free. Even then I sometimes get reactions (usually to chemical sunscreens that are in a lot of day creams).This product is not a good choice for women who have sensitive skin. It didn't make me break out because it actually burned and I had to take it off immediately. This product contains Diazolidinyl Urea which is irritating to a lot of people (including me).Conclusion: Lots of good reviews so I guess it's worth a try but skip it if you don't like perfumed moisturizers. Not for Sensitive Skins-- Perfume is Unnecessary,Neutral
Not sure how Philosophy did it but this truly does smell just like a margarita from the lime to the tequila right down to the salt. Definitely rings lime but not in a overly citrusy way. The scent is very fragrant is the shower but as all  in 's this does not linger on the skin. I know for most people the lack of these scents lingering is a con but for me it's a plus. I personally do not want to smell like a margarita all day and in general I prefer to not have shower gels linger as it interferes with my perfume.I'm a sulfate free girl when it comes to shampoo so I haven't used this on my hair but it doubles are a bubble bath just as well as a shower gel lots of bubbles. Also lathers very well as a shower gel.Would repurchase. So good,Neutral
I've been a long time fan of Philosophy fragrances particularly 'Amazing Grace' and 'Pure Grace.' However this is my first experience experimenting with the shampoo gel bubble bath line. I opted for the 'Cinnamon Bun' fragrance based on reviewer popularity.I couldn't wait for the first shower.  I had high anticipation that I would experience an olfactory delight --- that of walking into a bakery where 'Cinnabon' rolls were just being removed from the oven.  Was that my experience?  Well not exactly. Yes there is a cinnamon fragrance but it is rather artificial with plasticky undertones.  That said it was still nice.  But as soon as the shower was over the scent in my bathroom and on my body dissipated almost immediately. This has been an ongoing complaint of many Philosophy products including the fragrances that require frequent reapplication. I'm not sure why this can't be rectified. I have used cheap grocery store shower gels that perfumed half my house and I could still smell the scent on my skin the next morning. What gives?Although somewhat disappointed with the fragrance I was pleased with how soft the product left my skin.  I actually forgot to apply body lotion after the first use which is always a post shower ritual for me.  I can see this product assisting with winter dry skin issues so I think I will keep some handy for that reason alone. I do think I will try a couple of the other fragrances too. Oddly my hubby seemed to like this one more than me so it's not a very feminine fragrance. It's one that can be shared with the entire family. Nice with a couple of reservations,long time
I am in love with this scent it smells clean and fresh. If you layer it with the lotion and perfume it will last all day. Makes a great bubble bath too!! LOVE THIS STUFF.,Neutral
...that's all I can say! This shower gel is out of this world... it smells better than the perfume even and that's saying a lot! Oh my god.,Neutral
I don't know what's in this perfume but every time I wear it I get compliments.  Even my son stopped me the first day I wore this and pulled me close to smell me and said &#;mmmmmmmmmmm&#; which says a lot seeing as I wear perfume every day and he has never done this before.  It will be one of my signature fragrances for sure.  Great price for a huge bottle as well.  A little goes a long way and I smell the fragrance all day as I move. Love Love Love,long way
This perfume is soo atractive. I always get compliments on it!!! It came fast and was packaged perfectly! It's the original scent wasn't tampered with. This seller is trustworthy I will buy again! All Time Favorite Scent!!,Neutral
This perfume arrived SUPER quickly and in perfect condition: in a brand new unopened box. I was nervous because I had read some reviews from people saying that they had gotten a knock-off or a perfume that didn't smell like anything. This perfume smells nice; warm and sweet and lasts all day. I sprayed it this morning at am and now at :pm I still smell it just as strongly as I did + hours ago. The bottle itself is a decent size (especially for the price) and looks very pretty on the vanity. Long Lasting,Neutral
I don't usually write reviews on Amazon anymore since it seems many who read them view them as a chance to start an online bash fast if the review given doesn't agree with their own personal opinion of the product...but I wish I had paid better attention to the not so positive reviews of this perfume before adding it to my wish list.Anyway I put this on my Amazon wish list because I love Glow by J.Lo and since this got so many great reviews I stupidly assumed I would love this one too. Like other reviewers have stated it does smell a bit &#;grandma-ish&#; for lack of a better description. When I first sprayed it it just smelled cheap.After mixing with my own chemistry it's just ok nothing special. At least it fades enough so that I am not one of those women strangling others near me with overpowering perfume. I have learned my lesson to first try a perfume before buying or putting on a wish list!As with any perfume it's all about how it mixes with your own chemistry so just be sure to try this one out first to make sure it's a good fit for you. Try it out before purchasing,Neutral
This a wondrously heavenly sexy  light  aromatic scent.  I am rather smitten by Miss. Lopez. I simply adore her and I am very pleased with this perfume. Heavenly,Neutral
It's supposed to be one of her more sophisticated scents and I certainly agree. The bottle is pretty cool. The scent is like a light musk. It's very soft which I think u could do during the day. It's like a strong floral so it's not too overly powerful. I could see myself going to work with this like it's not one of those head turner perfumes it's subtly musky.It's a day time thing in MY OPINION. But it's also a nice night time scent it's versatile in that sense. For a very detailed review see: [...]Hope this helped :) Love it!,Neutral
This is a great perfume. I've always loved Jenifer Lopez's perfumes because they are really good quality perfumes. This one is no exception. Awesome,Neutral
I love this perfume! I had this a couple if years ago and all this time I had no idea its on Amazon.I'm so happy I can find it easily now! I just received it and it smells so soft and pretty...I really love this scent! smells good,Neutral
This perfume is a must have for women who want a casual but professional scent. It is very nice and the price isn't too bad. Great Perfume,Neutral
This perfume should be selling for about $.. There is nothing outstanding about the scent. I do not know what the rave is about with this perfume. It doesn't last long the bottle is not attractive and the scent is normal. I am disapponted withDonna Karan.. pull up your socks!!.. you will lose your customers Not impressed with the scent for the price,Neutral
This fragrance is really stunning.  It's classy and soft and leaves a great trail of perfume behind you.  It's definately a summer fragrance.  It's a nice soft floral that won't turn too sour in the heat of the day.  It has the kind of smell that reminds you of playing out in the fresh cut grass.I think this is a little different to other perfumes out there and it's so beautiful that you really have to try it.  If you love soft floral and classy fragrances then this is for you.  I don't think Donna Karan is great in the perfume department but this has been the one great standout of hers.  Go try it. Stunning feminine scent @}->----,Neutral
this smells good but unfortunately the scent doesn't last long :( as often as id have to refresh it it wont last long guess ill order the actual perfume the next time instead of the cologne also noticed it smells almost identical to another cologne called th avenue. smells good,Neutral
I love this perfume. It smells wonderful. It is a very sweet scent but kind of suttle at the same time. GREAT PERFUME!,Neutral
This is by far my favorite perfume I usually get sick of something after a bottle but not this. This is very feminine and soft. I have always had great compliments on this perfume and will continue to purchase even as new perfumes come out this is a keeper. Shop around for prices but beware of fakes. Also it's good to layer this perfume with the lotion and wash as one down fall is that it doesn't seem to last though out the day. Or keep a handy mini bottle in your purse to freshen up. My favorite still after  years,favorite perfume
i just recieve this perfume and also  more i was so happy about it box looked great bottle also but at the time that i tried na na!!! fake perfume smells like water with alcohol! this is so frustrating and dissapointing. its wonderfulbut the original one,Neutral
for those of you who don't like heavy collognes that saturate the air...buy this! I bought this for my boyfriend fro Christmas and it is masculine and light and he and I love it. He smells so good! And it's not a heavy overly perfumed smell (yuk). It's just right. It's light enough to wear during the day (which he does) and that scent stays on him all day. NICE. smells nice,Neutral
I purchased it for my husband I never used or smelled FCUK perfumes before only have some clothes from them but I am really very happy with the perfume the price was great and the bottle is BIG!!! It's clean and crispy slightly spicy and sweet - not sugary or candy like sweet but good fragrance like sweet :) It's perfect for casual use and bold enough for the evening. I would recommend it for men under -. I would not probably buy it for my dad. very nice smell,Neutral
First off I am . I have pimples and I have big pores no wrinkles and a jawline that can't handle even slightly perfumed cleanser yet my reddest pimples are there. I was in heaven when I got the original foundation. I couldn't find an exact color match (which they recently released!) but dusted on very very lightly you can make your pimples a shade lighter. I would not recommend piling on on any of these products this one included especially if you're anything like me.But for the part of my skin that shines I decided this would be great! I mean it doesn't have that shimmer like the original something my t-zone doesn't need. Well disaster. It makes imperfections look worse even with a light dusting doesn't really combat oil if you have a problem with it and inflamed pretty much everywhere on my sensitive skin where the original did not. Be careful with this and test it on a small part of your face at an Ulta salon. It's free and you can see if you'll have a reaction-- this is true for all of these products. It's worth the trip.I wouldn't buy this again and would not recommend it to anyone with any skin problems and suspect it may give problems to many who have good skin. However in spite of my low rating I wouldn't say you should just give up. Some of those  star reviews may end up being you if it works. Love the product line hate this product.,sensitive skin
Gorgeous fragrance for some  seconds zero staying power. No one including you will know you are wearing it. Just like that  dollar stuff you get at the drugstore. Which leads me to believe the stuff is very cheaply made despite the hype. Try Flowerbomb by Victor and Rolf- very similar but long lasting and totally worth the money which this one is not. The same with all Philosophy fragrances and products. Hype hype hype. Are we so stupid to believe this is a quasi-religious experience ? Save your money for retirement. I will buy nothing from this hypocrit company. YyyyeeeeccccchhhhhhhhhhhEdit //- I thought perhaps I would edit my review in that it maybe was too harsh? Upon reflection I increased the negative review intensity. This product is still a big rip-off.Try Al Rehab perfume oils like Soft. Nice product no hype fair price. Baby boomers-save your money for retirement,Neutral
This is a very lovely perfume.  It smells of blackberries with something deeper and muskier underneath.  The deep scent grounds the berries keeps the scent from being too overwhelmingly sweet and makes it sensual.  This is a happy scent and one well-suited to wear in all seasons.  The one drawback is that this is not a particularly long-lasting fragrance which is a shame because it's beautiful. Blackberries,Neutral
I do love this fragrance but even when I layer the Falling In Love body wash body lotion and the perfume spray it does seem to fade a lot faster than other perfumes. Falling in Love is a really great scent so when I do wear it - I will continue to refresh the scent with an occasional spritz throughout the day. Falling In Love is my nd favorite fragrance,Neutral
Nothing else I know goes so well with spring & summer as Anais Anais. It's a fragrance I've loved for the past  yrs & still continue to wear it today (not every day but it's always in my perfume collection). Fresh floral bright vibrant feminine clean invigorating. It never fails to lift my mood when I want a pick me up. On fabrics it lingers for days which I love. Dries down beautifully & softly. Always a winner.I tried the eau de parfum also but I much prefer the eau de toilette which I find is lighter & fresher. The parfum is heavier in floral scent with more sillage. The price for the large .oz EDT here on Amazon is amazing compared to the .oz price. A lifelong favorite,Neutral
I was first introduced to this perfume in the 's when my friend in high school wore it. I loved it. It was such a soft floral scent that was really feminine and girly. I sort of forgot about it over the years but smelled it the other day on someone passing by and a flood of memories came back. Now I have to buy some for myself. I forgot how lovely the scent was until I smelled it again! A Classi,Neutral
Had not seen this product for years then noticed it on-line.  After purchasing it I remembered why I stopped using it  years ago.  It's really strong smelling.  Although I get good reviews from my husband and others who smell it on me I find it a bit overwhelming now.  Can't say how it would be on you.  I do recall that guys used to love it when I was in my 's and dating--which is always a great sign but I don't recall it being that strong when I put it on.  I find WISH is wonderful and much milder and get great reviews from people when I wear that perfume now. cacharel Anais Anais,Neutral
I have been a rabid fan of Lush products for years often having them shipped to me form Canada before they were so easy to buy in the states. Each product has a certain Earthy quality it and its nice knowing that people who make each an every single on of these luscious concoctions love them as much as the customers do and it shows!The Karma soap looks like a slab of gold in shape but is really reminiscent of candied carrots I would find in fruit cakes I used to eat as a kid growing up in Poland. The clarity of the fiery jewel like color is quite attractive as it makes for a nice soap to put in the guest bathroom or for self spoiling with hand made soaps that beat the other cookie cutter types by a mile. The scent itself is a breezy breath of citrus with mother earth embedded deep in the core. The lavender and patchouli are a whisper a shadowy backbone to the zest and freshness. The multidimensionality of layering scents makes fore a very uplifting experience and I can smell the heady aromas every time I was my hands with it. I also love the Karma perfume which smells almost exactly as the soap.I find that my hands don't get as dry when I use this glycerin soap as opposed to regular soaps laden with chemicals and lards. But I always use a hand cream afterwards preferably one of those gooey Burt's Bees creams that come in heavy glass jars. My hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry the air or how cold it is when I used Lush soaps and a good hand cream.- Kasia S. Jewel like beauty,Neutral
My first experience shopping in a Lush store was in Victoria BC and it seemed a bit like a beauty bakery. You may go to Victoria to see the Butchart Gardens but if you want to scent your world with floral and exotic scents then this company has a lot to offer. You can truly surround yourself in natural bath bliss that is reminiscent of everything from freshly cut grass (the Jungle conditioning bar) to perfumes from the Mediterranean.The Bath Ballistic is an explosion of heavenly scented pink bubbles that float about like flowers and then seem to relax into little tropical islands floating in a pink sea. The color is rose but the scents are a blend of Synthetic Musk Jasmine Clary Sage and Ylang Ylang. The rice paper flower in the center opens up and drifts around in the water like white rose petals.After soaking for a while you start to notice your skin being deeply moisturized and after your bath you might notice you need to use half the lotion you normally would apply. If you try this at night you will awaken the next morning warm snuggly and still heavenly scented with essential oils. The wide range of feelings experienced after your bath may include everything from wishing to fall asleep in soft pink flannel pajamas to wanting a night of romance on the town (dimly lit restaurants with candles). Either way you will be relaxed happy and feel quite sexy.The softness of your skin may inspire you to wear silkier fabrics cashmere robes or look for a pair of pink marabou slippers and a chiffon baby doll outfit.A small sampling of delicious products arrived with this purchase and the solid jungle bar conditioner was fun to use in the bath because it doesn't drip all over and really seems to adhere to each strand and by the end of your bath you will have silky skin and baby soft hair reborn from a moisturizing treatment that includes ingredients like Cocoa Butter Passion Fruit Bananas Kumquats Ylang Ylang Cypress and Vetivert.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.

I bought one of these a few months ago and stored it in my bathroom cabinet for safekeeping till I was ready to use it. Every time I opened that cabinet the whole house would be perfumed with the smell of it! Finally last night I went ahead and used the bomb for my bath. The water turned a very pretty pink color and I thought the fizzing action lasted a lot longer than with other bath bombs I've used in the past and was somewhat stronger. (It's good if you do that trick of putting the fizzing bomb underneath sore muscles to get some light massaging action from the bubbles.) I love the smell of it -- it's like a perfect halfway between candy and floral scents. The fragrance stuck to me all night too; it was great. My skin also felt quite nice getting out of the bath (probably because citric acid is a major ingredient in the bomb -- it helps soften skin when put in a bath.)I do wish they were a bit less expensive but I knew what I was getting into when I bought it. That's why I saved it for a discontented day whereupon I felt I really needed it! Like floral candy,Neutral
I simply love this whole fragrance line. It's one of my favorites. I layer with this  starting with the shower gel then the body lotion then the perfume. I get many many compliments on it. It has a clean just showered fragrance that lasts all day!! TRUELY AMAZING AND FULL OF GRACE!!,Neutral
This has been one of my favorite perfumes for about  years now. It lasts a long time it is light smelling but effective and I always get complimented whenever I wear it. It also is cheaper on Amazon than it is at the Clinique counter at Macy's. Last a while,long time
A truly lovely and uplifting scent. Clinique definitely had a winner with this but unfortunately I cannot love this perfume. It was a staple in my high school and every other teenager I knew claimed it was her &#;signature scent&#; after Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) made this perfume popular for tween and teen girls in Legally Blonde. I wore it and so did every girl I knew. (This and Love Spell from Victoria's Secret and Cucumber Melon from Bath and Body Works... ugh) I can't stand to wear it anymore and when I smell it on someone my age I honestly wonder why. I have to think that they don't have the same baggage attached to this scent that I have.But I do find myself sometimes picking up a bottle and spraying a bit if I'm in a store and there's a tester sitting out. It does hold some nostalgia for me though quite bittersweet. Too High School,Neutral
I purchased Happy based on reviews of it here and from fragrance sites.  I've been using Estee Lauder's Pleasures on and off since they first introduced it alternating with Philosophy Pure Grace and Amazing Grace so my comparison is mainly between those and Happy.Happy is described a floral citrusy scent which is not exactly the way it smells on me.  I detected more of a synthetic sweetness to it along with an almost grapefruit scent rather than the more rounded and definitely floral Pleasures and clean fresh floral and powdery Philosophy fragrances.  I had a difficult time distinguishing the floral and citrus notes separately; from the time I put it on to several hours later and sniff tests from a friend the fragrance never changed or warmed up enough to smell any differently than it did straight out of the bottle.  I also have dry skin and it's winter and both could be the cause of the single-note results.Using the parfum spray alone and not layered with other related products like lotion the fragrance was noticeable for about six hours on me based on my friend's nose; mine didn't detect it past an hour which I expected since I only used a light application.  This is what I'd consider a day fragrance it's a little sharp for my taste of perfumes for evening.Buying perfume based on others' recommendations is always a shot in the dark because what's the best scent on earth to one person is a horrible sneeze-generating odor to another.  I didn't love Happy but I don't necessarily consider it a lost cause.  I'm going to try it again in the summer when my skin isn't as dry and cold.If you have the chance I would recommend trying out Happy from someone else or the beauty counter first to get a more accurate sense of what it'll smell like on you. Better tested from the beauty counter before buying online,Neutral
I saw Happy to Be in an email announcement from Clinique when it first came out.  I wasn't really interested in trying it out because I thought I'd like Happy Heart but don't.  I was shopping in a department store one day and saw that if I purchased the $ bottle I got a nifty little tote bag with a very cute small size bottle of the perfume.  I couldn't resist!Let me just say I love the bag but not the perfume!  It's too citrusy...  I like subtle perfumes and this one is definitely strong!  I think of the Clinique perfumes I'll stick with Happy although I now own the whole Happy set.  stars because it's part of the Happy family!,Neutral
literally I don't know they found this or what they did or how long this was sitting around but I got the bum end of the deal I used it pretty much to cover up bad smells around the house to use it up........ it was awful and ruined the like I have for the original bottle that I had bought at a department store....... will NEVER buy perfume off internet again. SMELLED LIKE CRAP!,Neutral
I get so many compliments when wearing Clinique Happy that I've stopped wearing anything else. It's fresh and light and slightly flowery. This order came from PerfumeWorldWide and was completely satisfactory. Beware of sellers who may be unloading old stock that has lost its original fragrance. Fresh and light,Neutral
This is my go to perfume. I have used it for years. It is great to use in the summer or winter. Happy makes you Happy!,Neutral
I sample tried this same perfume at the department store in the mall and I loved it.  But when I went to buy this online the scent is not quite the same.  I'm not sure why... maybe the seller had an old supply and therefore the scent faded?  I'm not sure but definitely noticed a significant different in the scent.  Much weaker and also not the exact same scent.  I'm not super happy about it since it was over  bucks. Different than at the department store,Neutral
I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law and it arrived on time and packaged nicely. Sometimes Macy's is out of this perfume so it's nice to buy it online and know that it's always available. It has a nice scent and the . oz is a perfect size to last about a year. Bought as gift,Neutral
This perfume smells simply amazing! it has pretty good staying power and you don't need a lot. It is a very clean scent and i have received many compliments on it. Highly recommended!! &lt; Love it!,Neutral
This perfume smells citrusy more on the orange side and a little sweet.However this perfume is too simple for me. For example J'adore is a sophisticated perfume with a hint of citrus but this perfume is just orangy and sweet which I liked when I was a mid-teenager (-) but not now.If you like a simple perfume that smells citrusy/orangy and a little sweet then this is a good choice. If you'd rather have a sophisticated than a fun perfume then I'd suggest J'adore it is fresh sophisticated lady-like and with a hint of citrus. simple sweet and orangy if that is what you like.,Neutral
It's a lovely light refreshing perfume. Lovely for daywear. Loves it guys! Oh So Perfect!,Neutral
[Good]It's cheap.It cleans.Cool looking bottle.There are no weird dyes like another product from Suave:Suave Men -in- Shampoo + Conditioner Ocean Charge . Oz (Pack of )Suave Professionals Men  in  Ocean Charge Shampoo/Conditioner . OunceIt smells alright; more on this below.[Bad]There is no peppermint smell. I really hate false advertising.The smell is really strong and it lingers. Why does every cheap product have more perfume than more expensive products? Wouldn't the manufacturer save more money by using less perfume? Using this shampoo is a great way of announcing to the world how cheap you are.There is no peppermint or menthol like feeling on your scalp.[Verdict]Decent and cheaper American Crew alternative. works,Neutral
Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask -  oz.  I wasn't aware that Neutrogena made hair care as well as skin care products but we have one right here.  I've been using this product for a while and find that I like it: it has a pleasant scent; yet it doesn't seem to activate any allergies so it's evidently not overly perfumed. The packaging is handy easy to grasp and work with.  The product is simple to use does not require the ultimately damaging utilization of a blow dryer and gives good results: my hair feels as nurtured as when I have used beauty salon products that cost much more.  It can be used weekly with good results. Simple to Use and Gives Good Results,Neutral
This cream is fantastic. It is light non-greasy & lovely to apply. Unscented so it does not interfere with perfumes etc.One jar seems to last a long time. First got this at Trader Joe's but they do not carry it any longer unfortunately.I am delighted to find this on Amazon. It is a wonderful product. It is amazing that very dry hands are almost instantly repaired with this cream. My hands were dreadfully cracked and painful. After one application I noticed an immediate improvement!I also like the price. It works far better than other creams! And I pretty much know most of 'em. (Jergens Lubriderm Eucerin Cetaphil Clinique etc.etc. etc....) This cream works splendidly with moisturizing gloves & does not soil anything.And Alaska is a challenge-it can be quite dry here in the winter-time.So if this cream works well here it'll probably do nicely elsewhere in the country. I've been using it for years. Just love it!A word on ordering:  Even though I sent it to the lower  the S&H; cost was about the same as the cost for the cream effectively doubling the price.  however I am so delighted with this product that the vendor did not succeed in ruining  it for me. Exercise caution on distributor-not from Amazon itself.Best hand cream at the best price! Best hand cream at the best price!,long time
I chose this over the other Clean&Clear treatment because it also contains glycolic acid to fade marks. This isn't a bad formulation - its a clear gel that soaks in well. Burns a little bit going on but nothing drastic. The smell is very overpowering for me and I wouldn't buy it again because its so loaded with perfume. But its not bad for a % salicylic acid product. Wouldn't buy again,little bit
I don't expect miracles from any wrinkle cream used entire tube.  This one is light has a hint of a slight flowery scent which I could tolerate but did not like --- hate perfumey smells especially when trying to sleep at night.  Seems to help a bit with acne and wrinkles. no miracles but good,Neutral
I used this for a little while. It worked very well for small fine wrinkles near my mouth. It also does a nice job with skin texture. It has a very light smell which I appreciate because I'm sensitive to strong perfumes.What it does not do well is lighten spots. I originally got it to lighten some very light sun spots and freckles. After about a month those had not changed at all. I also like others do not advise using it around your eyes. It will dry out that sensitive tissue.I switched to Ambi for a little while to lighten spots but do plan to go back to ROC because it is a good night cream. Good for small wrinkles,Neutral
This is a great product for those of us with acne prone yet aging skin. I was reluctant to purchase ROC for many years because I am a bit of a high end product snob. But it delivers. My skin responded well right away with no ill side effects. The only downside to this product is the fragrance. I am very sensitive and was turned off by the perfumey smell of the product on my wrist. However once it absorbs on the face you cannot smell anything. I wish all of the ROC Retinol Products could be Oil-free Non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) Dermatologist tested AND fragrance free... Best of RO,great product
I've been using this dilligently for - months and love it.  It works it works it works!  I had a lot of sun damage and fine wrinkles on my forehead that are simply gone.  And it's completey smoothed out my skin.  I had rough patches here and there plus oily T-zone and this cream was great on my entire face.  No breakouts and the texture of my skin is fantastic now. Concealer and make up go on a lot smoother now. The ONE thing I hate about this product is the heavy perfume smell which is completely unneccessary but I finally got use to it. I wish ROC would lessen the fragrance or take it out altogether. But I've tried expensive dept. store brands and this one works just as good and great price. I saw results in the rd week I started using this.  I don't use it every night anymore like - times a week now that I have the results I want. Love this cream. It works!  But heavy on fragrance.,Neutral
I've always used organic or mostly organic body lotion.  I have used Burts Bees Honey Milk lotion Aveda's body lotions and many others but my friend in NY had Alba lotion and i'd never heard of it so of course used it while i was staying with her. I am totally converted.  There is something about this lotion that makes your skin almost tingly at first but it absorbs quickly makes skin feel smooth for over  hours and smells light and doesn't conflict with perfume smells. I was happy to find it at such a deal. I'll be trying more alba products as they are cheaper than aveda. Best body lotion yet,Neutral
A good solid clean especially for pregnant bellies where itchy skin is an issue.  Clean non-irritating.  The scent doesn't bother me even though it is strong it's not a fakey perfumey smell.  I've been using it for quite a while. Good soap,Neutral
I cannot begin to say how much I love this product. I have tried many skin care solutions over the years and run into a number of problems because they are scented with perfumes or have heavy petroleum additives that upset my sensitive skin. This oil is quite dense not watered down like in some body sprays. The scent is refreshing and I find it works better for me than lotion. I've recently lost a large amount of weight and this has been the best solution to helping my skin firm back up again. My scars from surgery and my stretch marks have faded very quickly since I started using it. I also use it as a replacement for shaving cream (since I am allergic to most) and have found that it does a great job of protecting my skin and seems to make the blades on my razor last a bit longer. Best skin care product I've ever found,sensitive skin
My number one criteria in a new face wash was that it had to be all-natural/organic.  From reading the ingredient list you can rest assured about what you are putting on your face.  But I also needed a face wash to take off a solid layer of foundation every night and this product does just that!  It removes all my make up and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean.  I do need to use a moisturizer after washing both morning and night but that is normal for me.  Does it smell good?  No...without any artificial perfumes you can't expect a good smell.  It smells faintly of cheap bathroom cleaner but it isn't that bad.  It is very thin; it's about the consistency of baby oil except it isn't oily.  But even though it's thin it lathers up better than any face wash I've ever used!  You can't dispense it from the refill bottle it comes in so I put it in a cosmetic spray bottle.  That way there's no mess plus I use a consistent amount of three squirts every time.So overall I highly recommend this product!SummaryPros:all-natural/organicremoves all make upsqueaky clean feelinggreat lathereasy use in spray bottleCons:smellneed moisturizer (normal for me) This stuff is great!,Neutral
I have been a loyal user of Inner Grace for more than a year--and that remains my fave Philosophy shower gel. However I got a yen to try one of the others. I almost got the Amazing Grace but at the last minute changed to this one. Why? There's something about this scent that takes me back. There is this baby cologne smell that is reminiscent of the way children smelled in my Cuban childhood. Not the violet baby cologne but a more perfumey less floral one--crisper more unisex and soapy. That nostalgia is worth paying extra for.I like the creamy formula even though it does have a strong surfactant--SLS--which will irritate some. I have supersensitive skin and sometimes I have to go strictly with Cetaphil or Aveeno or Aquaphor or other unscented products. But when I can handle scents I like Philosophy's line as it doesn't irk me like some skinwise. Between the more sensual Inner Grace and this crisper Pure Grace I have shower gel/cream to cover a couple of my moods.For a cream this lathered exceedinly nicely on my washcloth. I felt very clean--well duh it has a strong cleanser--but also moisturized somewhat which is nice.Not everyone is gonna love this scent. Some might find it on the sharp side on the Zesty soapy side but it fades quickly like all other Philosophy bath scents. Layering only helps slightly. Dunno why but Philosophy scents just don't have hold. But that's okay. Smells so nice while you're showering.One star off for the . strong cleanser when they've made a cream formula to be gentler and . the quick dissipation of scent.But I would rebuy just the same. Nostalgia is a potent thing.Enjoy Crisp clean retro soapy smell in a nicely lathering cream formul,Neutral
Boyfriend bought this for me because he knows I like amber-based perfumes. This stuff has a slightly woody earthy scent but that fades a bit and leaves behind that lovely sexy amber note. Boyfriend finds it irresistible. A little goes a long way too. Sexy As Hell,long way
In their home fragrance line L'Occitane en Provence offers an Amber Solid cube that is lush with amber vanilla myrrh and other notes.  So appealing is this scent to me that I took to wearing it--grating it with a Microplane and dabbing it on with a cosmetic brush.  An expert in wearable fragrance warned me that my obsession with this amber might result in some skin breakout and took it upon herself to find me a substitute that was safe and cloned the scent that I liked so much.She found it!`Amber Butter' by Auric Blends produces almost the same aromatic blend albeit in a wearable format that comes in an intriguing little carved pot that looks great on your vanity.  Sliding your finger across the top of the butter and anointing your throat earlobes or wrists will swathe you in a sweet amber cloud that will stay with you until you bathe.Please note that as I am unaware of the actual ingredients that formulate the composition of Amber Butter I can only say that the aroma is similar to that of L'Occitane's Amber Solid.There are two negatives.  Given he softer consistency of this solid perfume when compared to other solid scents it seems as if Amber Butter will not last very long given the small amount in the pot and the quantity that your finger will pick up if you are not careful.  Additionally be aware that as the cap doesn't secure tightly I would not recommend this solid for travel in one's purse.Bottom line?  Auric Blends Amber Butter is a lovely amber scented solid that will please lovers of amber and especially those who enjoy L'Occitane's Amber Solid Home Fragrance cubes.  Highly Recommended.  Please note the small yet lovely packaging.Diana Faillace Von Behrenreneofc Just the Fragrance I Wanted!,Neutral
OK so admittedly I am an amber maniac! Always have been. I have tried almost every amber perfume out there oils and solids but I prefer the earthy more natural-smelling ones. I bought this amber butter on a whim and all I can say is that I was absolutely blown away! It is this type of scent that originally got me hooked on amber!  The first amber oil I ever purchased smelled exactly like this butter but I could never find the oil again as the supplier went out of business. I have been searching for over  years! I have finally found a worthy replacement!  Thank you!OH and the little wooden jar is sooooo cute! It has a screw-on lid so I think it will be ok in my purse. Be aware that it is small but a little goes a long way with this!!! MUST-HAVE FOR AMBER LOVERS!,Neutral
I absolutely LOVE this little jar. The Amber Butter reminds me of the 's I'm gonna refill it with some solid perfume when it runs out. Excellent carvings and well made,Neutral
This isn't anything like the Bath and Body Work's Sensual Amber fragrance so don't expect it to be. This is a very potent natural Amber Butter and a little tiny bit goes a long way. Great for both Men and Woman. Im a Woman and I prefer bolder scents so a little bit of this rubbed on the inside of my wrist was perfect. I also like to mix it with the Auric Blends Eygptian Goddess or another one of my perfume oils etc.If you love natural scents you will probably enjoy this one.It comes in a small carved wooden container and inside is a small amount of the Amber Butter. Remember you only need to apply a small amount. If it's too strong for you at first let it melt into your skin for a little while and then it'll be fine. You don't want this to be overly strong just enough to mix with your natural chemistry. It's sensual spicy and unique. Try it! Unisex scent for those who prefer more natural perfumes.,long way
I've been using this product for six years and I just can't say enough good things about it.  I love the stuff!Purchased originally to help my daughter with cracks and redness on her knuckles from damage caused by frequent hand washing with anti-bacterial soaps at school I have found Miracle of Aloe Miracle Hand Repair Cream works for other issues too.My mother's dog developed a yeast infection on his skin which led him to bite at himself.  His belly was particularly raw but when we started using this product on it (in conjunction with a blow up collar so he couldn't bite at it... and a gluten free diet) it healed beautifully in a very short time.If I use it after I wash my face at night as a replacement to my regular night time moisturizing cream my face is soft and hydrated in the morning.  No stickiness or greasiness just softer and younger feeling.  I use only about a dime size amount for my face and neck and work it in slowly starting around my eyes and moving outward and then down my neck.  Amazing stuff!My husband uses this cream on the tips of his fingers to ease cracking that seems to be constant.  When he uses this product twice a day every day the cracking disappears.The cream is heavy but it takes very little to cover a good sized area.  Wherever you use it you will notice improved hydration retention in the skin as well as softer smoother texture.  There is a slight odor to the cream but it's pleasant and not perfume-y.With % Aloe it heals naturally.  I don't always go for natural products but this one truly works extremely well and is fairly priced considering you need very little of this rich cream to get the job done.I highly recommend this cream to heal and/or improve the quality of their skin.  Those having issues with dry rough chapped cracked skin on any part of their body will most appreciate the quick relief offered by this product.NOTE:  I have also tried theMiracle of Aloe Miracle Foot Repair Cream  Oz As Seen On TV Guarantees to Repair Dry Cracked Feet & Heels! Helps Stop Itching & Unpleasant Odors Quick Fast Easy and Completely Painless! Contains % Ultra Aloe All Natural Formula. Penetrates Deep T...which works very well too.  Just a tad thicker than this one but it seems to be essentially the same formulation. Many uses for this rich healing cream,Neutral
When I was experimenting with cold creams a while back I came across this upon recommendation from a friend's mother. While I liked the old fashioned perfume smell I found the consistency too greasy and it didn't remove my makeup too well or moisturize my skin. In fact I wouldn't recommend it to people with sensitive skin since my face did redden when I used it (and I highly doubt it was the red dye in it too). Smells Nice But Did Not Deliver,sensitive skin
It's hard to tell if a product is really natural or organic without checking the Environmental Working Group data. But I use this product anyway and it's very nice. It leaves my skin soft and clean without perfume. If it's free of toxic chemicals I really like this cleanser,Neutral
This body spray smells really good sweet exactly like cotton candy.  The only problem is it doesn't seem to last very long.  I'm a real stickler for long lasting perfumes so if it doesn't last long I won't wear it.  I gave it to my granddaughter and she LOVES it. Smells good.,Neutral
It's a bit much for a dog I should think for a shampoo to smell so so much like perfume. Smell so potent,Neutral
We purchased this for our very smelly Basset Hound.  No matter what we did to keep that dog from being stinky that is just part of being a hound.  This shampoo neutralizes that smell and does not cause any dry skin.  My husband and daughter are very sensitive to perfumes.  We do not even use laundry soap with a scent.  This was a perfect solution for our stinky dog. Works extremely well.  Gets the stink out of your stinky pet but does not overwhelm you with perfume!,dry skin
Be Delicious by DKNY is a lovely summer scent filled with earthy notes of green apples melons pears cucumbers grapefruits and white grapes. I reach for this one when it's hot out. The scent is very fresh and I find myself imagining it actually cools me off the way a tall cold fruity cocktail would.Top notes start with a strong whiff of grapefruit which mellows quickly to melon cucumber apple and pear. The floral and woody bottom notes include soft violet tuberose white amber and a hint of sandalwood.My husband actually bought me this perfume on a cruise ship (hey - duty-free). That's a pretty hefty recommendation as his nose is very sensitive to heavy scents. He actually *likes* this perfume on me.This is my default summer signature scent. I get lots of compliments when I wear this perfume spray but only for a short while (the scent wears off in under an hour). I found if I spray my hair and clothes besides my skin it lasts a bit longer. DKNY also makes a lotion-based version of this scent and I would think layering it would really be helpful for increasing the wear-time. Personally I am too cheap to be bothered. When this runs out although I love the scent I will probably seek out a summer fragrance that simply lasts longer.The spray bottle itself is quite charming with its green apple theme. It's easy to hold and easy to apply. You don't have to hold your hands in a weird position to get the perfume out and also comes out in a nice even spray.As summer turns to fall and there's more of a bite in the air I do prefer the spicier Red Delicious version of the various DKNY apple scents. It's a bit more sexy and sophisticated (imagine seasoned apple cider instead of crisp virginal apple juice); the scent also lingers longer. Love the scent; wish it lasted longer!,Neutral
The bottle and scent description might seem a bit kiddish with the cute apple shaped glass and a silver dome but this fragrance is simply stunning. Fruity and light it smells like fresh skin hard to formulate into words and letters how shockingly beautiful it really is.  Most of the time I go gaga over woody scents I don't mind smelling like Earth wood and water but from time to time I get lost in a juicy succulent scent and this one is one of my favorites. On skin it morphs into a hybrid of sensuous perfume and fruit water cooling down to a mellow and wonderfully subdued fruity musk. The fruit doesn't overpower in fact it's a sophisticated accent that is hard to pin point.Notes in this scent are: American Apple Cucumber Grapefruit Candid Magnolia Tuberose White Muguet Rose Violet Sandalwood Tender Skin Accord Blonde Woods and White Amber. It's perfect for the warm months as the sun helps it exude from the wearer's skin.- Kasia S. Pure delicacy,Neutral
I love this scent I got it when it first came out in  they gave away samples in the Macy's Impulse show and it has become my signature scent since then.  I receive lots of complements from everyone in the office since it really works with my body chemistry.  I work in a department mostly populated by men and they all tell me that this is the first perfume that does not irritate them.  Go out and try this scent.  It changes with time to become a bit floral after a few hours but my body chemistry can maintain the crisp fresh apple scent so it really works for me.  I love it. You just smell Yummy,Neutral
I have been using DKNY be delicious for about two years now. I bought the largest size after I sampled it. I am still using it! It has a flowery sweet scent. It lasts a long time. Actually it is one of the longest lasting perfumes I ever used (I previously used Chanel-Chance Armani-Gio Davidoff-Cool Water Sarah Jessica Parker-Lovely etc.) The bottle is beautiful but be careful not to drop it. Even if the glass part is very sturdy the plastic part on top breaks open. It is still functioning perfectly so it is all that matters! I know that everybody has very different preferences when it comes to perfumes but please at least give Be Delicious a try in a department store if you are considering to buy a new perfume! Absolutely love it,long time
Daring and provocative enigmatic and mysterious Be Delicious is a perfume with much to say. Dazzling with its spicy heart notes Karan's message is seductive and perhaps even troubling. Way to go Donna Karan!  stars for you! Sweet and Sexy!,Neutral
Smells fresh and slightly fruity but not cloying at all. Since I generally dislike fruity perfumes that was a plus. Nice enough but not heart stopping. I don't think I'll buy it again. Nice for summer and someone young,Neutral
After I smelled this on a co-worker I had to have it.  I was concerned that it wouldn't smell as nice on me you know how body chemistry affects perfumes but I haven't been disappointed.  This is a really great scent. Vanderbilt for Women,Neutral

I used to be able to find shampoos for oily hair in stores but over the past  years or so they seem to have gone by the wayside.  I started using this shampoo  years ago because I have very oily hair and none of the supermarket brands seem to work long-term.  I would always have to switch off every other day and even then they'd build up and cause my hair to be heavy and greasy.  I switched to all organic hair skin and laundry products several years ago.  At first it seemed odd that my hair didn't smell heavily perfumed all day after washing it but these shampoos aren't overly fragrant.  Your hair will smell more natural and not fake.  I've had people tell me that I smell like nothing when they will hug me or whatever especially my sister in law who thinks it's weird that I don't smell heavily perfumed all the time.  I take that as a compliment.If supermarket brands are failing to get your oily hair clean try this.  Yes it will dry the heck out of your hair if you don't need the extra help but I have found it to be perfect for my hair. Perfect for oily hair,Neutral
I despise floral scents.  To me they smell old ladyish.  When I first got a whiff of Burberry Brit it smelled warm and inviting.  It has notes of vanilla and musk and . . . is that butterscotch maybe?  It can be a little strong when sprayed on directly but I find that the intense scent fades fast and becomes a lingering warm and sultry scent.  Even at the end of a long day I can sniff my wrist and still catch a little of the Burberry Brit.  A little goes a long way with this bottle - I have had the same bottle for a year!  Amazon shipped it quickly it arrived very carefully packaged and they have a phenomenal price.  I would recommend this perfume to anyone who prefers sultry and warm scented perfumes. Love it!,long way

This scent is masculine and lovely at the same time.  Every time I wear it one of the men I work with comments how nice I smell and said the only scent better on a woman would be bacon.  I am pretty sure that is a compliment :)  I like to mix up my perfumes seasonally but this one is used year round! YUMMY!,Neutral
I always buy my Burberry perfume from amazon. Much cheaper than a department store and you're getting the exact same product. Highly recommend it!Burberry Brit is my go-to scent. I always get compliments on it. Everyone says the same: the smell is beautiful without being overpowering. Favorite Scent For a Great Price,Neutral
Basically I narrowed it down to perfume for my mom for Mother's Day. I decided to go to Amazon sort by average customer view in my price range and there it was. I ordered it. I didn't open it to take a whiff. I worried about the smell until my mom finally got it and tried it. Phew! It smelled wonderful and she loved it. I was a little nervous because I heard it smelled masculine but I didn't think so. The smell was so fresh and wonderful that I want some for myself now! Mother's Day gift.,Neutral
This is a fresh clean-smelling scent. I sampled this at a store near my house and then purchased on Amazon because it was cheaper and I am glad I did. The product I got was fresh (not old stock as is sometimes the case when buying perfume on Amazon) and I have received several compliments on this fragrance. It is not overpowering at all. I am looking forward to trying some of the other Inis scents. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because it does not last very long. (I recommend spraying in your hair for some staying power.)One note: This is listed as a &#;cologne spray&#; and is considered a unisex fragrance. I can see the argument for that but I feel as though this would be lighter on men than most men's colognes. I am a woman (and I tend to like floral perfumes) and I don't think this scent is lacking any femininity. Fresh clean light fragrance. Not overpowering and pleasantly subtle.,Neutral
Wow this perfume is lovely. It's rich and subtle but a little spritz goes a long way so I recommend using it sparingly! Mmm,long way
I am the type who loves a light scent. This is a very light scent but oh my goodness is it strong. I do one small squirt holding it a couple of feet away from me and it is still very very strong. Not necessarily a bad thing you just have to make sure you use it in small doses. It does rub off on other people easily too. I am not kidding about the strength of this perfume. Overall though I love the scent. I usually have issues with most perfumes as the majority of them smell cheap to me. This one doesn't smell cheap though. I just got the . oz and I was surprised how big it really is. I don't think I will ever need another bottle because I like to rotate my fragrances and already have enough to last me a lifetime.

I was so excited to receive this Inis perfume which I bought exclusively based on the rave reviews I saw here.Unfortunately it isn't for me. It indeed smells very fresh and clean as other reviewers describe however it's too heavily citrus for me and smells like a cross between the Coast and Irish Spring soaps marketed here in the U.S. Actually I might prefer the smell of those as they are less citrus! The citrus note gets stronger the longer you have it on too.I agree that the scent is androgenous could definitely work for either a man or a woman. If anything it's maybe more on the man side but just a tad.Scent is a very individual thing so reviews aren't the most reliable in this category. It may be the right scent for you it just wasn't for me. Reminds me of Coast and Irish Spring bar soaps,Neutral
There is a reason this perfume is one of the highest rated on Amazon.  It smells amazing!  It was also very nicely packaged and the bottle itself is very pretty.  My mother and my boyfriend's mother got this as a gift from me and they both have used it almost everyday.  The receiver of this perfume will not be disappointed! Great Perfume!,Neutral
This is a very lite facial cream and the smell is not too bad. It goes on evenly and smooth and I imagine one could wear this under their make-up without it feeling heavy or greasy. A little bit of this does go a long way perhaps a pea size or a bit larger is all one needs. Again the smell is not bad more crisp and clean smelling with a hint of perfume. After using this all up I most likely won't purchase this again. Not a heavy cream,little bit
Since I have used it I haven't know this one's effective.This product's perfume is a very good and I like perfume.Maybe I repeat this item. I don't know effective,Neutral
I usually use this brand other items I loved this brand natural perfume.I recommend this item. I present for my favorite artist's present.But this brand items is very expensive in Japanese shop.I bought from Amazon.com I was satisfied with getting items in reasonable. present for favorite artist's birthday,Neutral
I'm active in several sports wearing helmets sweating or the cold of winter I needed something I could moisture my scalp with but not weigh it down or get my gear full of perfumed smells.  This is amazing!  The side benefit is shiny fluffed up hair that it noticeable to me and like one reviewer said scalp itch is reduced.  There's nothing worse then having to scratch you head with a helmet on.  Its expensive but worth it to me.  I didn't buy this to *grow* hair but condition my scalp and that has shown good results. Very impressed,Neutral
I just wanted to clarify to those who claim to have received fake product... it's not fake. I bought mine in an authentic Biosilk -piece gift set from Target. There is certainly no way that could have been fake and yet my product is just as many others describe - mainly SUPER runny (goes all over the place unless I'm very careful). I wouldn't really say it smells like alcohol but it doesn't really smell too pleasant straight out of the bottle. When it's in my hair it's as strong as a perfume and I'm not sure if it was originally like that. Results are okay certainly not bad but nothing really to write home about. I think Biosilk themselves watered down this gigantic version of the product because if they didn't it would be way too pricey for them. Cheapskates. I have still found the thick original formula in the smaller versions. It's not fake - it's how Biosilk is making them now!!,Neutral
The smell of this product is really powerful for me. I understand that others may be not as sensitive as I am about smells example: I can't wear perfume sometimes because it causes to me to sneeze a lot.So if you are not sensitive to smells this works okay. I think it works just as well as Paul Mitchell's skinny serum which I am going back to. I just like it the skinny serum better. Really intense perfume smell - meh,Neutral
This does a great job of color care and smells nice & clean so it doesn't clash with perfumes or other hair products. It doesn't weight my hair down but yet it feels nice & soft. Excellent product!,Neutral
I have very thick hair and am attempting &#;no poo&#; so I enjoy the longer bristles that reach down to my scalp and help exfoliate while the shorter bristles distribute the oils. I can clean it quite easily. There was one cluster of bristles missing after my first use and I honestly couldn't say if it arrived like that or it just fell out after I brushed my hair once. Either way that part wasn't so great. Also I'm hoping the rubber smell will get less and less because I don't like that transferring onto my hair. Luckily I have hair perfume that I spray on to cover that up or else it'd probably bother me a lot more. As far as looks go it's a beautiful brush and I really hope mine doesn't start peeling/cracking like some others have noted. Does a great job and feels good on my scalp,Neutral
The strong scent was a turn off as soon as I opened it and I wish I had returned it immediately but I thought that I would give it a chance. After having it for  months I can't bring myself to finish the jar. I really like it's sister productOlay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face and Neck .-Fluid Ounce which is not as thick and is mild in scent. I've purchased MANY Olay products to find the best ones and this Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment wins the medal for strongest perfume smell. Since my nose can't handle it I am unable to rate it's performance but it is too thick of cream for my normal-to-oily skin. Sorry Olay I can't rate it high like the rest of your products. Strong perfume smell and too thick for me,Neutral
I like the lavender shade and the moisturizing effect of the cream but it's a bit sticky and doesn't go on as smoothly as I would like. Additionally the scent is much too strong for me. When I've tried to use it as a night cream the scent literally keeps me awake - it's that noticeable. I prefer an unscented cream. Facial creams should not have perfume in them ! Not wanting to waste the product I used it as a day cream instead since it's not too oily for use under my makeup. I finally finished using the jar but won't be purchasing it again. Scent is Too Strong for Me,Neutral
I have been using the Olay products since about July  and am very pleased.  I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night on my whole face and neck after washing with Dove Regenerating Calming Night Soap (liquid navy colored bottle) and I use Olay Smooth Skin Exfoliating Scrub about once or twice a week at night.  In the morning I use Avon ANew Eye Lift Cream around my eyes and then Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream on my entire face and neck. I think this combo particularly the Olay Regenerist products have made me look YEARS younger--with the grace of God of course.  I added the Regenerist Night Recovery about  months ago and it made a difference for me. Lots of people at work tell me I look younger too.  My skin feels great!  It's firm and velvet soft.  And wait till I tell you I have lost  pounds in the last  months!  Why do you care?  Well my face should be sagging all over the place with that kind of a weight loss especially since I carried that weight for years and my skin was well-stretched.  I should need a crane just to hold the wrinkles up! Guess what??? It's firm and velvet soft.  I won't say I don't own a wrinkle but they are very very minimal. I've had people tell me I don't have wrinkles too but there are little tiny ones there hiding in the makeup. Oh I'm  too--so don't think I'm  and telling you I don't have wrinkles like they tell you in those adds on TV. It smells great too. I am sensitive to certain products with perfumes but not this. No problems.I am mighty pleased with these products BUT use them awhile.  Nuthin' happens overnight Hon! (We call everybody Hon in Balmer) (That translates to Baltimore).Update March .  I switched the morning treatment from Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream to Olay Total Effects x.  It is great.  Super creamy.Update September --Still using same combination of products--still working great.  Am  now and have lost  lbs and am still quite pleased with these products. Works for me!,Neutral
Really wanted to like this product. However it has some flaws.- The container isn't opaque which means that the product is exposed to the sun. Retino - the key anti-wrinkle ingredient in this product - is known to break decay with exposure. So it should be kept in an opaque tube that is tightly sealed. That is not this product.- The smell is very strong and they clearly color it and use tons of perfume.  I can't imagine that this helps with anti-wrinkle or healing properties. But it does have the effect of driving my cat away at night because it is so strong.- After applying my hands become sticky. Really sticky. Strange feeling like they're becoming puckered. I immediately have to wash them. I don't know what this is attributed to but it's quite unpleasant.Overall disappointed in this product. I don't think I'll be buying again. After doing some comparisons I prefer the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream. too much scent sticky,Neutral
First I want to mention that this is a small bottle.  The information in this listing does not give you the specifics on that.  It is a oz. spray bottle.  Despite that I am immensely happy with this purchase.I read the reviews information and even checked the product website about this item.  I love that it is environmentally friendly and chemical free.  Everything I read about it was glowing and wonderful so I decided to buy it to use on my -year-old.My daughter has fine wavy hair that is prone to flyaways and has a lot of snarls every morning.  I use this liberally on her every morning.  Yes you still have to comb through the snarls (they don't just disappear like magic) but this product helps as soon as it starts to get combed in.  Also despite the quantity I use on her hair there is no sticky stiff residue like most of the brands you can buy at the store.  The smell is light and almost nondescript (which I prefer because of sensitivity to strong perfume or colognes).  Later in the day when the product has been well absorbed and my daughter has been through her normal crazy play routines her hair is soft tame and frizz-free.I have also used this item on my hair as has my teenager.  It's amazing how great it stands up to my thick curly hair's urge to frizz and my daughter's relentless damaging heat-styling.  It is an amazing product and well-worth the price.  I think that this size with the thickness of the solution in the bottle will easily last as long if not longer than  bottles of the stuff I could buy at the store.  That said it really isn't that much more expensive than the other brands.If you are looking for something that is more substance than smell and will last all day while not putting chemicals on your (or your baby's) head this is for you. Wonderful for the whole family,Neutral
This seller needs to get his facts straight since the product description is misleading check out Burnout Website for the ingredients. Burnout's Ocean Tested mix has some organic ingredients but this is not an acceptable mix although it offers higher ZO than their best selling mix which has .% ZO and selling for almost twice as this Ocean Tested mix on Amzon.  Burnout does not specify certified organic or the percentage of organic in their mix but certainly dumps a lot of ingredients in the mix. I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide (non-nano) %Other Ingredients: Purified Water Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice* Capric/ Caprylic Triglycerides Sorbitan Stearate Polyglyceryl- Laurate Cetyl Dimethicone Magnesium Sulfate Organic Avocado Oil* Virgin Hemp Seed Oil Organic Cucumber Extract* Organic Green Tea Extract* Tocopherols Organic Pomegranate Juice* Helionori Hyaluronic Acid Ethylhexylglycerin Hydrogenated Methyl Abiate Polyaminopropyl Biguanide.Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one blocks both UVA (- nm) and UVB (- nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water used in many industries in ointments creams and lotions. Non-irritating non-allergenic and non-comedogenic used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS - ZO which has a mean particle size greater than nm when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body do not enter the bloodstream and are not a threat to human health.SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes for example a person wearing SPF can be exposed to the sun without reddening for  times longer -  minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.BABO has % ZO which is not organic but conventional even with higher amount of ZO than organic brand like BADGER with .% ZO but ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. ZO is like mud the higher the better but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so for many high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy. For a small investment sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn pain cancer medical bills pain killers etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high ZO is the best solution so one needs to read the ZO percentage as well as the rest of the ingredient since it is the whole mix which counts not the high percentage of ZO only. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients at least % certified organic protect skin from sun with no gums no thickening agents no perfumes no alcohol no restricted ingredients by any other countries no chemicals no additives and no softeners.

SOOOOO estatic they finally made this paraben free. This is a great shampoo the smell is so clean and so fresh I really wish they would make a daily shampoo or even a perfume with this scent it's THAT good!!!!! This is also the best clairying shampoo I've used it's not a drying or stripping as others. You cant bet the smell or price either this is good stuff. Try it you wont be disappointed!! SMELLS AWESOME AND NOW PARABEN FREE!!!!!,Neutral
Judging by the reviews you would think that this product smells like the vilest of the vile.It makes me wonder what people expect herbal soap to smell like.  Yes neem soap does not smell perfume like Ivory or Carress.  It has a mild odor reminiscent of peas or beans in the garden mixed with a bit of fresh earth.  Nothing major at all!  Furthermore the smell doesn't linger.I purchased this for the kids because they were exposed to a kitten with ringworm.  Ringworm is now gone but we used ketoconazole cream  and colloidal silver in addition to the soap.  I have continued to use it on my face (because of its reputation for helping acne) and I am noticing fewer blocked pores and significantly softer skin.  For now I will continue with the soap.  I would add that if you have hard water it takes a bit longer to rinse off. Reports of odor are highly exaggerated,Neutral
This is all natural with no funky fragrances which is perfect for me because I'm very sensitive to perfume that is not natural (just going through the fabric softener isle at the store makes my stomach queasy). This soap smells like the natural smell of neem oil which is a strong smell a little bit like peanuts.If you think you can  tolerate that you will be very happy with the results. In two weeks I noticed a big difference in the skin on my upper arms which is where I often get red scaly patches about the size of a half-dollar. This soap combined with a good lotion really made a difference. I usually use a neem oil lotion at night and a shea butter lotion during the day since the Shea butter smells a bit less strong.I think it's really worth a try if you have problem skin. Each bar lasts a long time and you will get a lot of uses out of it as long as you don't leave it sitting in water. My toddler threw a bar in the toilet and it dissolved; I saw the label floating in the bowl and I knew.Give it about two weeks to work-- it took about  days for me to notice any real difference but it did happen.Recommended. GREAT for problem skin but smells like peanuts,little bit
I like this product because I am actively Burt's bee customer I love natural productsSo this oil blend good  as a night ointment on my skin and during  winterI applied all dayI dislike too much perfumery smell from lavender I wish to have  light smell on my natural skin care products.Hope this product keep me looking much younger with good looking without any fine lines. oil blend,Neutral
*****This is a natural facial repair serum from Burt's Bees and it is excellent for this use. However I rarely use it on my face except at night sometimes because it is so intense and heavy. The rest of the time I use it EVERYWHERE else! I mix it with my overall body moisturizer (which is pure sesame oil) and rub it all over my body. I use it full strength on my hands. I use it anywhere on my body that needs attention healing moisture. For special occasions I use it as an all-over body moisturizer full strength.I go through probably a bottle a month so it is expensive but I enjoy it so much I don't care. A little goes a long way but I am using it for so many things.The smell is probably my favorite small of any beauty product. It is an aromatherapy-type smell earthy not perfume-y at all. All of the oils are natural and blend together to create a perfect lovely fragrance. It is subtle but unlike anything else I've tried.The ingredients are: Rosehip seed oil jojoba oil lavender oil tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E) evening primrose oil borage seed oil wheat germ oil hazelnut oil neroli oil rose oil calendula extract green tea extract beta carotene tocopherol ascorbyl palmitate (vitamin C) retinyl palmitate (vitamin A). They are all natural and wonderful!I like the bottle size too as it is easy to travel with. At the price I consider Burt's Bees Repair Serum an affordable luxury that I can't do without!***** Wholesome & Affordable Pampering for Your Skin,long way
I cannot attest to the ability of this product to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles or its ability to support the restoration of skin.  What I can confirm are the fabulous moisturizing properties of this product.I have dry skin and I break out easily.  I was wary of using something with so many different oils but I have not had any negative reactions while using it.After washing my face I place a few drops on my finger and apply it over my entire face -- not just in the areas around my lips and eyes as suggested by the product description.  Then you wait a few minutes and apply your regular makeup.  I have had no problems with flaking skin (and makeup) and I live in the very cold Midwest.This product lasts a good amount of time.  As noted previously I apply it to my entire face and I do this in the morning and the evening.  I usually need a need bottle every five to six months.  $ for a moisturizer that will last me six months conquer my dry skin and won't make me break out?!?  It is something you cannot afford not to try.As a side note this product does have a scent.  If you are sensitive to perfumes or other scents you may want to see if you can find a store that carries this before buying so you can test it out.  Given the many natural oils in the product I suppose it isn't surprising that the smell makes me think of a wooded area.This product is made in the United States and not tested on animals. the answer to dry skin,dry skin
I don't often use hairspray--the last one I bought is still mostly full after two years of owning it so I don't an extensive repertoire of products to balance this against. That being said I did find an opportunity to use this a few days ago. I wore my hair pulled back in a high ponytail because my hair wasn't cooperating and I use it to keep my hair in place. The scent was surprisingly nice for an aerosol hairspray. I wouldn't wear it as perfume but it didn't make me gag like Aquanet or something like that would have. I am used to be extra-hold hairspray so I underestimated how much of this I would have to put on. After probably three spray downs my hair was held fairly well. I still had to use bobbypins on the sides though because this didn't completely tame my flyaways but for the most part it held nicely. My main praise for this hairspray was the fact that my hair didn't look stiff greasy and crunchy after applying it. Even after running a fine toothed comb through my hair it still looked natural. I am so used to gels that hold the shape of whatever I do to my hair and will leave comb lines or bobbypin marks--but this didn't do that at all. Infact when I let my hair down later all I had to do was brush my hair out and it felt like I had never had hairspray in in the first place. Definitely lives up to the Spray & Play branding.I would give this product / stars because it was unable to tame all of my flyaways. I know this wasn't super-control hold xxxx but when I use a hairspray I expect it to be able to hold back a piece of hair that weighs . oz. Nevertheless I was very impressed with how understated the spray looked on my hair. It didn't look or feel like I was wearing any hairspray at all. I would definitely recommend this brand but if you want more control I'd go for one that has a bit more hold. Flexible hold doesn't make hair crunchy.,Neutral
I almost don't even know where to start with this review my opinion on it has changed dramatically over the last three weeks. My first impression .. absolutely disgusting smell like really really really bad. So bad in fact I looked up the product to read other reviews to see if maybe my bottle was tainted or old or if something was wrong with it but it turns out that's just how the products smells.. I can't describe it it's just a very bad smell. BUT!!! I continued using it because I spent money on it and Was determined to stick it through.I am soooo glad that I did! I also purchased source naturals skin internal cream and have been using them together every morning and every evening. I'm a pretty busy mom and i'll admit I don't look in the mirror Long enough to examine my face close-up very often. I do however love face products. I consider myself a face cream and lotion and Serum connoisseur of sorts.. And have tried way too many and end up putting them on the back shelf in search of something better.Last week while I was helping out at my sons school I was talking to one of the teachers & she stopped midsentence to complement me on my face .. ! She said your makeup looks really really nice wait are you wearing make up? your skin looks really pretty! (I do not wear make up..) I was so stunned I didn't even know what to say for a minute.. I believe I actually stuttered.Then just this evening one of my closest best friends came over Who Iv spent at least half ofmy time with over the last  years said to me while and cleaning in my kitchen in my sweats my hair all a mess after a long busy day.. 'Mellany your skin looks wonderful have you been tanning? (Yeah i've got time for that..) ..Well while some of you may get compliments aLong those lines all the time for me.. not something I hear like umm ever. Especially out of the blue. Now I'm only  i've got decent skin don't get me wrong. My pores are bit bigger at times that I would like and my skin is a little oily and I don't spend too much time on it. Out of nowhere unsolicited compliments on my skin is not of the norm.So I decided I'd throw out a review on this product and say I am pretty darn shocked it stinks really bad my husband says it smells like old greasy oil and dog poop my son told me I smell like a fart face when I made him smell it because I thought it would be funny. But after looking closely in the mirror tonight and after the recent compliments on my skin out of nowhere I've got to tell you .. this is pretty amazing stuff. my Skin really does look great and amazing! it's Firmer! It's even toned and smooth! It's so soft! I actually have a very healthy glow.. Not shine.. Not grease.. A real honest under the skin glow! When it comes down to it I'd rather have a really stinky amazing product then a really good smelling product thats full of perfumes and chemicals and crap & doesn't do much in the way of improving my skin whatsoever. This is something special and I will be using it for the rest of my life for sure.Now time for me to figure out what to do with all these lotions and creams and serums taking up space on my shelf.. Christmas I guess (; Kinda stunning really..,Neutral
Lovelovelove this stuff!  I have NEVER found a self-tanner that produced such a natural looking tan.  The gel makes it easy to apply without running or streaking.  I use it about  times a week to keep the same level of colour.  No perfume or medicine smell.  Just light clean fragance that my asthma easily tolerates.  Usually dries within  after application that I perform at night.  Waking up with a sun kissed look is esp. nice.  Even better no need to apply makeup base. Saves some money that way and price on Amazon is over  dollars cheaper than grocery store. Have gifted it to co-worker and will include it in gift box to another friend.Enjoy the natural sun-kissed look! No Burn to Skin or Purse,Neutral
I'm on the fence about this product.  It's better than  stars but not good enough to give it a full . First of all I'm a regular user of Fake Bake aerosol however I ran out of it and needed something stat & thought I'd give Neutrogena Micro-Mist in medium a shot.The biggest &#;pro&#; of this product (and something that Neutrogena doesn't appear to advertise) is that it's CLEAR. A clear ultra-fine mist...who knew?  My pillowcases thank Neutrogena.  Neutrogena would do well to make this a selling point for this product.Unlike many other reviewers I didn't feel the need to rub it in after applying the mist (but then again I only used it on my face (hold your breath) neck chest and shoulders - maybe that has something to do with it.) I didn't have trouble with the nozzle as so many other reviewers report and I felt the application provided even coverage. I applied the mist before bed showered it off the next morning and was very happy with the sheer even color it provided.The biggest &#;con&#; is the scent.  It is SO strong and people with asthma or allergies to strong perfume-y scents should really beware and think twice before buying this product.  As we know all self-tanners have some kind of odor or scent but this Neutrogena product really is one of the scent-iest self-tanners I've ever used. It's overwhelming. On the fence.,Neutral
This is a really great product. The only down side is the fragrance. It actually smells like the perfume vanilla fields. If you like that then this will be perfect as the product does work and makes your hair soft and even shiny. The smell is strong and I am not a big fan of vanilla scents so I don't like that about it but once it's dry in your hair you can't smell it anymore. Great stuff,great product
I love the fragrance! Refreshing without being overly perfumed. Leaves my dry curly hair feeling soft and healthy. Has lasted over a year and still about / full. I bought shampoo at the same time. Lasts forever! Second time I order on Amazon.,Neutral
I bought this item actually to add to my all natural pest control mix that I make myself. I opened the cap & it is a good thing that I would not wash with this body soap b/c my husband & I are in agreement that it smells just like the old timey drug store perfumes they would sell called Jovan's vanilla musk plain musk or white musk. I cannot stand the smell of this as it reminds me of a knock-off perfume sold in Flea markets. Sorry I like to be honest with my opinion with my sense of smell. I cannot stand it but hate is a strong word so I am settling for don't like. Very low end and cheap smelling musk from old timey drug stores.,Neutral
This product is awesome and smooth I love that it is perfume free... I have very sensitive skin and I can't use just any thing this is the greatest thanks... and it was sent so fast..... way to go. The best,sensitive skin
A friend of mine recommended Shalimar perfume to me. She said it was so beautiful I had to try. So during my next trip to a perfume store I asked for Shalimar. Sprayed it on paper and then on my wrist. Both the paper and my wrist smelled so terrible to me that I felt as if I was going to vomit. Couldn't wait to get home and wash it off my wrist. Very old-smelling nasty and pungent perfume. Like some kind of old rotten wood/pines. This is not to offend anyone. I understand that every perfume smells different on different people. I also understand that what one person likes another may not like at all. We all have our own tastes in perfumes. Well this is the case for me with this particular perfume. To me it smells so ancient that it reminds me of old rotten/moldy woods! Yuck! Gagging Smell,Neutral
Shalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Cologne Spray . Oz.I am a lifetime user of Sharlimar Eau De Cologne Spray by Guerlain. It is a superior product and one of the things I love about this essence is that it blends with a woman's own body chemistry to give the wearer the wonderful scent of Shalimar with one's own unique essence. I love the quality of the product and the fact that it has not been bought by other perfume companies nor has the formula been changed in over  years. I am allergic to many of today's popular fragrances but have never had a problem with Shalimar. I would recommend this beautiful scent to any woman who is looking for a perfume that is elegant sensual and classic.Thank youMarilyee Dowling shalimar review,Neutral
I like JLO but this fragrance is just discusting. I hate it. One of the worst smelling perfumes of the century. I would not spend one cent on this. I collect perfumes and have huge variety. I can tell you this is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever smelled. LIVE smells much better. I would give it  stars! Gross!!,Neutral
I really didnt think that this perfume would have such disgusting smell.Maybe its not original from JLO s perfume?! Anyway i dont advise this product awful smell,Neutral
For her first perfume J Lo released Glow a very clean fresh-smelling scent.  To me it is a combination of a clean soapy smell with a bit a of fresh floral.  It is sofly feminine without being sweet or girly.  I think it's appropriate for all ages--it has a youthful appeal yet I'm close to  and enjoy it plus I bought some for my mother who just turned  and she likes it too.  Destined to be a modern classic Glow is a beautiful scent with wide appeal. A clean fresh scent,Neutral
JLo Glow is a refreshing light delicate floral that's become a frequent flier in my perfume wardrobe. It is a nice change from oriental fruity-floral and chypre scents possessing the same soapy-shower-clean vibe as Lauder's Pleasures or Lancome's Miracle. But it is not stridently soapy or astringent in the least. The pink grapefruit and orange blossom give the right amount of sharpness in the opening and they quickly mellow to reveal roses lilies and soft spring rain. I agree with those who note similarities between Glow and China Rain fragrance oils. There's definitely a white-musk base going on here. I don't smell the sandalwood or vanilla at all. It's just easy to wear whether I'm dressed up or down and it suits my chemistry very well. One caveat do NOT over-apply! This wears more like an EDP than an EDT-- two to three sprays is plenty and you'll get all-day wear. More than that and you'll get all-day migraines. Spray judiciously and ENJOY! Surprise Holy Grail for a fragrance sno,Neutral
I have been wearing this perfume since my friend put it on me at work in ! OMG! It smells so good on me and it goes really well with my Amir Argan oil body lotion!! Its light and fresh smelling i always get compliments on how good I smell =-) It is very hard to find now because I think JLO is retiring this sent =-( NOOOOOOOOOO! Please dont stop making this JLO!?!? LOVE IT,argan oil
This perfume is absolutely amazing and I always get compliments when I wear this. It's definitely one of my favorite scents (and definitely smells better than her other perfumes). My only complaint is it fades quickly. You can spray yourself  times before you leave you house in the morning and the scent is GONE by noon. I love fresh feminine scents and this is definitely one of them they need to figure out a way to make it so it doesn't fade so fast. If its on sale I buy it if not I stick to Cartier. LOVE the smell but it fades way to fast..,Neutral
JLO Rocks the Perfume world as this scent is pleasant and gets better all day even when she sweats.  This is rare and enjoyable as the scent lasts without being nauseating. Really Pleasant Smell Not Overpowering!!,Neutral
My friend got this for a Christmas present and she has been dumping it on her head or something because it is OVERPOWERING.  A young woman and even an older woman smells much fresher and nicer with just a hint of perfume.  Not sprayed head to toe and stinking like a polecat.I would recommend Cabotine or even th Avenue (have a look at scentiments dot com).  And please ladies do not use too much.  You cannot cover up a dirty body smell by dowsing yourself with cologne.  Have a nice refreshing shower or bath and then apply the cologne sparingly. Smells overpowering and unpleasant,Neutral
I did not care for this perfume. Didn't receive any compliments and I'm sure on somebody else is fine everybody chemistry is different. Didn't work for me. Not for me,Neutral
It arrived new and on time how ever when  I spray the perfume on me.....Oh my God...it did not smell as good as I hoped for.It might be that my body chemistry and the perfume ingredients didn't mix well or the smell clash..It smells good when I spray it on paper....but on me smell terrible so I gave it to my sister.I hope it will go better with her body chemistry. Not so crazy about this fragance,Neutral
i don't know what the other  reviewers are talking about. i wish they really liked this b/c i do. this is my favourite perfume! i am the type of girl that dislikes strong heavy perfumes like Chanel No. and what older women like to wear. not saying that Chanel smells bad but it's just not what i'm into. i like to smell sweet and girly. i notice when you wear sweet ones compared to the heavy stuff people always ask what are you wearing? so if you have the same tastes as me you will love this. j.lo really delivers quality. as j.lo explained its scent (in a press conference) it really is fresh soapy sexy clean. the best way to sum this scent is it has a sweet mixed with just-got-out-of-my-soapy-bath scent. before this came out this is the scent i always wanted to smell like: sweet but not too sweet and not overempowering; just light and natural. and as a reviewer mentioned the bottle is beautiful! so sexy and stylish like j.lo herself. it has this diamond necklace and when you look at it it just makes you feel like you're a star. it really is good try it! i'm going to buy tons more! my fave scent!,Neutral
This was $ in a department store and I got it for about $.  Great deal!  Thanks ever so much. LOVE this perfume,Neutral
I don't like Jlo but I love this perfume. Smells very clean and light. People always tell me I smell like I just got out of the shower..... It's a clean smell and is long lasting. People in elevators will appreciate you with this on! Very clean,Neutral
Other than actual pieces of art or a home-cooked meal perfumes may be the most subjective thing to try to evaluate. I ordered this perfume after trying out many samples at the store. This one was one of may favorites and the price I got from amazon was terrific so that (literally) sold me. My wife likes it too and I can't ask for more. It's a good perfume at a good price. A nice feminine scent that the wife and I both like.,Neutral
Fresh and romantic. Smells very rosey and clean. I love this perfume and it lasts most of the day. Very light and airy. Lasts long  and smells great!,Neutral
This is worth the investment!  Very low keyed and aromatic after application.  It smells as the name implies-glow's.  Kind of like a soft burning candle at christmas time.  Never overpowering or offensive.  In fact during christmas I noticed that the perfume section had a whole collection of Jennifer Lopez scents in a package of one and the only one missing was Glow.  Glow is enormously popular with the young kids and old folks as well.  Its sweet and gentle like a lamb.  Definatly a good scent to buy for any age group! Very nice!,Neutral
Glow is the perfect enticing fragrance for daytime use it gives you a feeling of being fresh and clean throughout the day. It is blend of amber flowers fruit with vanilla that creates a clean alluring scent.It's perfect perfume for a busy day at the office or an afternoon of shopping with your friends.The fragrance does not stay on all day that is why I gave it a  star rating.  But I still highly recommended it to everyone. Clean Alluring Scent.,Neutral
This is my wife's new favorite. Its very pleasant neither light nor heavy just right. It lasts all day and then some. we gave three of these away as gifts to family members and everyone loved it. Highly recommended. This is a great value too as this perfume is $ in stores. New favorite,Neutral
Wonderful find and a great price.. I love the smell and it is the actual thing.. I couldn't think of a better place to get my perfume from.. Thank you! Great price,Neutral
If you like perfume that last for hours then this is it a must buy but please spray a small amount please because a little goes a long way so you do not have to spray alot i love this perfume,long way
I recently ordered this perfume and then noticed in some of the comments different people have commented on it being the real perfume or not. I then contacted amazon customer service and they assured me that this is the Real thing and not a knock off version. I recieved it and it is in original Calvin Clien packaging and it smells wonderful! Lasts a long time and I get lots of compliments Yes!!! Its the real thing,long time
This is an old scent.  I remember this when I was in college back in  and a class mate had this on and I was transfixed on the beautiful smell coming from her.  This is a crisp clean scent I would put this in the green catagory of scents.  I perfer the Eternity Summer to this but only because its sweeter and I tend to lean toward sweet scents.  This however is a very pleasant scent but my nose has become overwhelmed with this scent for over twenty years now and can tolorate it no more.  Its a pleasent scent but quite old in terms of scent life for a marketed perfume. Forever ago.,Neutral
I love this perfume so when I saw the price I could get it for in this size No hesitation!  Is the real thing and I will definitely be shopping for the perfumes I am already familiar with online!  Highly recommend! GREAT DEAL!,Neutral
I buy perfume all the time and had never bought Eternity until I smelled it on a friend. It is a clean crisp smell but not too strong. I have since purchased it and find I like it very much. In fact it has jumped up to number  in my ever growing collection of perfume. I would definitely recommend this lovely fragrance. ONE OF THE BEST FRAGRANCES,Neutral
I gave my mom this perfume for christmas and she could not be more happy with it. Perfect product for a gift Great gift!,Neutral
You can never go wrong with Calvin Klein Escape!!  The smell is absolutely wonderful!!  This perfume has been a long time favorite of mine!  The shipping was fast.  The seller was very easy to deal with.  Thank you!! Smells delightful~,long time
This is my sister's favorite perfume and I puchased this for her as a gift.  I am going to buy this from Amazon whenever I need to because of the great price! Favorite perfume,favorite perfume
I like the smell of this after it is on a while it gets better with time it reminds me of the ocean or the beach. Good Perfume,Neutral
I love this perfume.  It has a light pleasant scent.  This perfume is a good choice if you prefer a lighter perfume. Nice Scent,Neutral
Terrific perfume! Is one of three or four scents that I always wear. Is a tried and true classic for me.  Will always wear it! terrific perfume!,Neutral
I am almost % that this is the same quality that you can get in a department store but for much less money. The scent is fantastic. At times I wonder if perfume online is fake but I do not think this is. I have been looking for it for a long time. It is my favorite scent. Just like I remember,long time
I bought this as a gift for my friend and she really loves it. I really like the price. Its a good perfume for a reasonable price . Bang for your buck,Neutral
This is one of the most popular mens' fragrances since it was launched by Giorgio Armani in . The reason for its universal appeal its just the right blend of floral fruity and musky notes to create an aroma that is pleasing for men to wear. And as a woman I can vouch for its pleasant effect on my olfactory senses.Here is the composition:Top Notes : Florals/ Citrus - Jasmine Rosemary Hespiridic (citrusy)Middle Notes: Fruity fresh - Persimmon Fruits Marine NotesBase Notes: Woodsy Musky - Cedar Patchouli White Musk Rock RoseThe overall effect is not too overpowering and the transition between notes is subtle. It's a fragrance that lends itself well to daytime wear as well as evening wear. I find it a very well balanced perfume that hits just the right notes and works very nicely for the metro man. A light and fresh fragrance for men that women love.,Neutral
I just got this for my birthday.  I first smelled on a lady that came to my office and obviously left a lasting impression.  I had to have it.  Unfortunately this bottle will go fast because it is my absolute favorite. The best smelling perfume ever ...... FOR ME!!!!!,Neutral
This is a very nice perfume. Its not too strong and it doesn't wear off too quickly. It has a nice rosy smell to it and is definatly worth the buy :) Nice,Neutral
I have tried hundreds of colognes and own scores of top of the line ones myself. Over the years that I've been studying using and exploring men's colognes this is without doubt amongst the best that I have seen. A true timeless gem in the world of creative perfumery. Thank you Mr. Armani for this wonderful gift to the world of men's fragrances. One of the Best Men's colognes ever designed,Neutral
I know there are several other perfumes out there that are way more expensive but I still think it's a lot of money to spend.  Fortunately this size bottle lasts me at least six months and I use it just about every day.  I've been using this same perfume for over  years so that's got to say something! Love this perfume!  Wish it weren't so expensive.,Neutral
i bought this perfume for my mom  and they are fake im so mad about this. dissapointed TOTally!!!! please check out fake!!! perfume,Neutral
I am super picky when it comes to scents! When I say picky I mean it... I like sweet but it can't be too sweet. Hate strong smells hate most floral scents. I don't know how I managed to get a collection as big as I have of perfume. This is the newest to my collection and boy does it smell amazing. Not too strong. The scent smells like blueberries and flowers but it's light. It is a sweet fresh smell. So pleased I picked this up. Also got a bottle for my aunts th birthday and she also loves it. This goes to show that this works for women of all ages (I am less than half her age for reference.) Do not recommend for women that like very strong bold scents. Beautiful scent. LOVEE,Neutral
This is one of my absolute favourite perfumes.  I love perfumes and I own so many but this is one of my top .  It's light and fresh and definately a summer fragrance.  I love how it comes out more later in the day if you get warmer.  And if it acidentally (or on purpose) makes it's way into your hair it has an even more stunning smell each time your hair blows past your nose.This is a classy and classic fragrance.  It's fresh and lasting without being overpowering.  You can wear this on really hot days where normally any other perfume would ruin in the heat.  I love it and recommend it to anyone who loves light fresh floral fragrance.  It's beautiful. Devine :-(),Neutral
Esta fragancia al principio no me agrado mucho pero vaya que cumple con el objetivo de usar perfume. Deja una estela fresca algo frutosa y suave muchas personas creen que es el Paris Hilton for men. Muchas mujeres han ca&iacute;do rendidas cuando uso este perfume. Agua Mediterrane,Neutral
This light summery scent has always made me swoon.  Once upon a time they made a body powder and large puff and it was a delightful layering of scent.  I might try to make a powder using the perfume I'll let you know how it turns out. loooooooooooooong sniiiiiiiiiif  always reminds me of summer!,Neutral
This perfume is a stronger soft floral that last a long time when you wear it.  I believe this perfume is for a more mature woman than for the younger girls!  I started wearing this when I was in my late 's (now almost ) and noticed I was always being told that I smelled so pretty that is why I still keep this as one of several perfumes I love wearing. Pretty Scent That Last A Long Time!,long time
This is one of three perfumes that I bought on amazon recently.  I based my choices mainly on the reviews which is why I felt safe buying this one.  Two of the three I really like; not so with this one.I don't know of I got a bad one or what but the scent is horrible!  It seriously smells like raid bug spray.  I will say that once it dries down the scent turns from bug spray to a very strong floral scent.  For me it's too heavy once it dries down and I just can't get around the bug spray scent. Just Doesn't Smell Good,Neutral
I was married in a Jessica Mcclintock dress but don't let that prejudice get in the way of this review. I've used this perfume for almost  years and still love it.It is one of my favorite daily fragrances. It is light flowery but not too sweet not too heavy and perfect for daytime. I get compliments on it constantly even though I can't smell it on myself. I love the initial scent and feel like I'm starting the day with a pleasant introduction to others instead of an onslaught of overpowering fragrance.I would recommend this as a daily use casual scent. Love This Fragrance!,Neutral
When I first put on this perfume I thought of this perfume as just another perfume in the market - the small did not particularly appeal to me.But it was not until my wife complimented that I smelled good !  Now I know that cool water is going to me on my shelves for a long time. Got compliments from my wife,long time
the packaging was ok.. didnt have the protective film the comes whit all the others perfumes. smell nice  perfect love,Neutral
distinguished the personality with this fragance soft wooden base perfume. endures all day  my husband for years has been used it. One of the best man eau de toilette,Neutral
I really wanted this perfume for a long time my girl friend gave me as a present.But i was very disappointed with this because it lacks longetivity and i dont quite like the way it smells...definitely not for me..... not worth dissapointing,long time
This scent is very different from your typical perfume scent. Someone mentioned it smelled like insect repellent but this is not true in my opinion. I have a huge fragrance collection and out of all this is the one I wear the most. ONE SPRAY GOES A LONG WAY! This is where people make the mistake. Don't overwhelm yourself with like  sprays. This is when it might not smell too great. I used to spray myself like  times last year and my boyfriend did not like it. But now with only one spray in between your neck and chest area is great. My boyfriend loves it and can't stop smelling me. As a joke he says Let me guess Just one spray? lol. Its great. My boyfriend loves this....ONLY ONE SPRAY!!!,long way
I worked at a perfume boutique for a while and was able to take testers home every once in a while this was one.  I do like it but bottom line im glad I didn't spend the money on it.  It's very very strong which is not my taste. I prefer lighter fragrances that are more discrete not the kind that suffocate everyone in the room.  That's basically what this one does.  Like I said it's a nice smell but after wearing it for a few hours (just one spray) my nose starts to burn. good but strong,Neutral
This fragrance has fruity top notes floral middle notes (jasmine and white rose) and musky bottom notes. The dry-down is nice. Some other summer time perfumes I use are DKNY Be Delicious which is a bit more fruity and stronger and Davidoff Cool Water is more spicy and sporty Oxygene by Lanvin has a slight chemical note to it and Shi by Alfred Sung is more floral and soapy. Light Blue is nicely balanced between fruity and floral and musky. The musk anchors the perfume or it would be too light to be noticeable. This perfume perks me up during the day but it is a little too light for me for night time use. For night time in the summer I use Michael by Michael Kors Chanel Allure and J'Adore.The . oz version was available for a slightly lower price at a discount club during Christmas. I think this price is still a bit on the higher side for just . oz. Nice for work and daily wear but is barely noticeable after a few hours.,Neutral
Smells crisp and clean.  This is my favorite perfume and my signature sent. Smells crisp and clean.  That it all. Smells crisp and clean.,favorite perfume
When someone greets you and says &#;You smell delicious&#; you know you're wearing the perfect perfume.  I love the smell of Light Blue.  It's light fresh and just the right touch of fruit/floral.  It smells so good people can't help but tell you. &#;You Smell Delicious&#;,Neutral
This perfume is for every day use. I love its fresh smell. The price was good here too. I enjoy it and will purchase more. smells fresh and pleasent,Neutral
First I am not knocking this seller. My review concerns the perfume only. I had such high hopes concerning this scent. I had read many rave reviews. When I received a sample scent in the mail I was shocked at how much I disliked the fragrance. To me it smells very similar to Anais Anais (which can be bought at a much less expensive price) and I have never cared for Anais Anais. Both perfumes are overbearingly spicy to me. I really like soft fresh and sweet scents. Light Blue had nothing that I liked about it. I suggest buying a sample size first of any perfume and make sure that you like the scent. What smells great for one person does not smell great to another person. Reading the reviews I thought I'd love this scent. But to be honest I hated it. Smells just like Anais Anais ...,Neutral
..the hunt is over. This is without a doubt hands down my all time favorite fragrance. Literally gives me a burst of sheer JOY when I spray it on myself. Its light summery crisp clean and reminds me of being on top of a windswept Italian Villa....breathing in fresh air. It's very versatile:  I love that I can wear it out for a night on the town or just spray it on in the morning to hang with my kids go shopping or even walk the dog! I have the perfume the cologne the lotions the gel.....its lemony-soft and light and I can't recommend it enough. SIX stars!! call off the dogs...,Neutral

I usually like floral scents but this was a different scent for me to choose I picked it because it is my sister's favorite.  I loved it - used the whole bottle in less than a month because I sprayed my body hair clothes etc. several times a day.  I'm an over-doer with products.  I hate that when you put on perfume everyone else can smell it but me!  So I re-apply.  But love love this - would buy again every woman would like this scent it seems like,Neutral
I have worn this for years.  It is one on my favorite perfumes.  I find the scent intoxicating romantic and sensual. Awesome Fragrance,Neutral
I'm really disappointed when the perfume came in. When i smelled it i was expecting to smell something with mangos in it. Boy was the description wrong to me the perfume smells like gardenias which is going to make me sneeze during the allergy season. And what's even more disappointing is the fact that I can't return it. Yeppy I'm stuck with this damn thing woopy-do. not what was described,Neutral
Wow I am absolutely in love with that perfume. It is sublime it is suave mesmerizing delicious Lord have Mercy... I had been using Touch as my signature perfume for years and never thought that I would ever find any other that could surpass my expectations Well I have discovered Bora Bora. Bora Bora my love Our love affair has just begun and I am cheating on Touch... OMG this is my new Signature perfume,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume of all time!I rarely leave the house without this on.Love love love this perfume!! Favorite perfume,favorite perfume
My friend introduced me to Lucky You last year summer and suggested that I try it. Well it took me from then till now to try it since I've been busy trying some other that turned out not so nice! I bought this over the Christmas and I feel LUCKY! I LOVE perfumes and now I LOVE LUCKY!!! The scent is really nice not over powering doesn't bother me at all.....and it lasts all day and more. People around me at work says they like it a few never heard of it before and wants to try it. The price was great and I got it right on time so again LUCKY ME! And OH....The bottle was bigger than I expected....even more LUCKY LOLLOL LUCKY YOU....LUCKY ME!!!,Neutral
When it comes to perfume many bottles are extremely small for the price you pay. Lucky You's bottle is HUGE and it's very reasonably priced. I had gone for almost  years without buying any perfume relying on body sprays that never lasted long enough for me. The last time I bought a bottle of Lucky You it lasted ONE year with VERY frequent use. It's a fun sexy sweet scent that I can only describe as having hints of citrus musk and jasmine (sorry I'm not good at describing scents lol). My only gripe is that I reallyyyy wish it lasted longer. I can only smell it faintly at the end of the day. I like to be able to smell my perfume without having to sniff my wrist or elbow so that's one star off. Nonetheless I'm in love with the scent so it's  not a huge deal. I probably need to layer the scents (lotion plus perfume) and it will last longer. A little bit goes a long way highly recommend! LOVE the scent but wish it lasted longer,little bit
I'm not really a big fan of this perfume. The only reason I got it is bc my husband really likes it on me. My husband likes it...,Neutral
I like this EDT very much! It is sooo sexy. In Europe this smell is very popular. When men wear this perfume women follow them :). My husband always was a fan of Drakkar and nothing else. Once I brought a piece of paper sprayed by this perfume and left on the counter and my husband asked me what is this it is smell soo awesome! So after that i bought this EDT for him as a gift on Valentin's day. And it is definitely an original one (size . oz). It is awesome!,Neutral
I fell in love with this fragrance the first time.It has a very light feminine touch to the scent.It is not too sweet as to make you feel like working in a candy factory.It's not spicy as to make you burn your nostrils.It is elegant soft and gentle.Yet it has a manly feel to it.It is not over powering but every time the scent reaches your nose your heart stops a beat.It catches your attention when you least expected it.Buy the largest size it's a bargain.While i love this product with one million stars my last order got here damaged with the cap smashed and bottle leaking.Amazon immediately took care of it.Love the service love the fragrance love the price.Buy it without any regrets. Beats all of the fruity and spicy perfumes in the market,Neutral
This is an enjoyable smell (I'm terrible at describing colognes or perfumes so I won't bother) which he and I love. You can't go wrong with it. I was going to buy this from Macys again but I was so happy to see that amazon offered it for a cheaper price. Nice Price for a Familiar Product,Neutral
This is one of the best perfume I've ever had. I strongly recommend this product and the seller. Incredible smell,Neutral
I can say that I've tried a fairly large number of various perfume brands. Only a handful were good enough for me to get a second bottle. I've never owned more than two bottles of the same fragnance.Lolita Lempicka however is so unique and so unforgettable that I bought a THIRD bottle already. This scent is so captivating and beautiful (and totally one-of-a-kind) that I can never get enough of it. I even spray it over my body before going to sleep!Love the sweet vanilla/musk as well as woodsy/amber notes. Very warm sensuous feminine addictive and intoxicating scent.Now that's what I call a GOOD fragnance. This is one of a very few scents that I will never get tired of and that I'll continue wearing probably forever :o) I have my bottle of Lolita on hand at all times whenever I go. My THIRD bottle :o),Neutral
This is a great perfume and I always get people asking me what it is.  If you like a perfume with a sensuous vanilla fragrance this is the perfume for you.  The bottle is also very attractive. Love this fragrance!,Neutral
I received this a few weeks ago... At first when I smelled it I did not like it and wanted to scrub it off but I wore it one more time and tried to brave through it. I love it! I am doing research reading on perfumes and the noses of perfumes. First when I spray this on I smelled &#;bug spray&#; but that was the licorice and star anise note. This scent is sweet but still dark and mysterious. If you do not like gourmand fragrances and are new to licorice based perfumes... You will not like this. Wow!!!!!!!,Neutral
I've worn this perfume for almost  years now. It's a beautiful floral scent that smells great. It lasts throughout the day and doesn't lose it's smell. My favorite,Neutral
I don't know if I got an old one or what but this perfume smells like spray starch. Or like a cross between spray starch and those old unscented hairsprays (like Aqua Fresh...do they even still sell those??).Was totally bummed because everyone seemed so happy with this scent and I bought based on the reviews.I ordered the L by Lolita at the same time and it smells great! Nothing at all like this other (and reviewers said they were close sisters) so maybe I did get a bad bottle.Update: After  hours of smelling like spray starch I scrubbed my skin with a hot washcloth. THEN it still smelled but it smelled good! Musky/powdery/vanilla like people described. Still smelled strong just no spray starch. And it smelled almost identical to the way the L by Lolita smells right out of the bottle. Smells like spray starch,Neutral
Lolita Lempicka is without a doubt my all time favorite perfume. It has a definite licorice note to it but it's wrapped in this yummy goodness that just sort of makes you happy to be alive. I've loved it since junior high school and I'm in my mid-s now. All time favorite!,favorite perfume
Excellent perfume with an unusual scent.  This has turned into one of my absolute favorites and I receive many compliments from both men and women.  When I run out I always buy a new bottle I hope they never stop making it.  The bottle is absolutely lovely as well. Unusual sensual calming.,Neutral
This is one of my all time favourite fragrances.  It's such a beautiful and feminine smell that is delicate yet strong and fruity yet floral.  You can smell caramel and maybe lychees.  It's similar to Angel but better and I never get tired of it.  Not to mention the stunning purple and gold apple shaped bottle with the gold apple core/stalk sprayer.I first bought this in Seattle in  and today it remains one of my favourite perfumes.  It's such a beautiful smell that I get comments about it often.  I really like it and hope you do too. Stunning feminine beautiful @}->----,Neutral
I received a sample of this fragrance from Sephora and I absolutely love it. It's a soft scent with lavender and vanilla undertones. I'm not usually one for traditional pretty fragrances but the licorice undertones give this perfume a little kick. The result is something a bit mysterious unique and special. I think I will buy a full-sized bottle of this. Very unique fragrance,Neutral
There just is nothing else to say about this perfume. It smells as good today as it did when it first came out. Will always love this fragrance,Neutral
Great price it is the original perfume some reviewers have noted the some scents seem different in packaging and smell. This was not the case . Arrived securely packaged and intact very pleased !! Love this scent !!,Neutral
I think I discovered Sunflowers about  years ago when I was . The scent was so uplifting and confident but soft and friendly. To this dayit's still one of my favorite perfumes. And this vendor shipped my perfume in a timely fashion and in excellent condition. Highly recommended. Still the Best,Neutral
I got a mini of this for my mom a couple of years ago for her birthday and she thought it was so-so. However I on the other hand loved it! To make a long story short the perfume became mine (my mom is more of a Red Door person I guess). This flowery powerful perfume is sure to seduce and allure!*This fragrance has notes of rose cedar lemon musk moss amber manderin and jasmineTips/Suggestions/Comments involving Sunflowers:) This is a rather moderate scent. I would'nt call it subtle nor would I call it intense. It's juusst right~) This perfume lasts about as long as most perfumes ( or so hours).) This perfume is great for a day at work OR a night out in town.) This perfume at least in my opinion is great for both adults and teens so Moms feel free to share this scent with your daughters! (or vice versa) It's Time to Stop and Smell the Sunflowers!,Neutral
Ever since buying this Perfume years ago I have had to have it daily! I'll tell you why.  Since I have been using this fragrance I have had nothing but fantastic comments from both ladies and men!  No matter where I'm at - grocery store - furniture store - working at a golf Country Club etc. both men and women always comment how WONDERFUL I smell and then they have to know what it is that I'm wearing. Men that have asked me have actually written i t down so they could buy it for their wives! And women who ask want to buy it immediately too! I am not exaggerating. The other day I went into a Office furniture store to make a purchase. I was talking with the man who was taking my info. about a chair I was ordering and there was a lady who worked there sitting in the back of the room.  I no sooner walk in the store and the lady says to me: YOU SMELL SO GOOD!!!  WHAT PERFUME ARE YOU WEARING? I told her Red Door and she said  I had that perfume before but it smells  so GOOD on YOU! I am going to have to buy it again!!! Every single day that I am out and wear this perfume I get the same type of comments...ALWAYS!!  And the way I look at it - as long as I get so many wonderful comments about it - there is no reason to buy or wear anything else! So this is my perfume of choice! Ladies - you MUST BUY IT! And MEN - if you want to buy a perfume for your ladies in your life - you CAN'T GO WRONG WITH RED DOOR! But it has to be the PERFUME - not the eau de toilette!!  It's the eau de toilette that probably doesn't last as long because it's not as strong as the eau de parfume!  You just can't go wrong with this perfume. Even my mother had to go out and buy it years ago after smelling it on me! I've been wearing it since my 's and now in my 's. It's perfect for every age as far as I'm concerned. Red Door Perfume - a MUST HAVE for all ages!!,Neutral
I will never love this fragrance... ever. It's so strong and gives me a headache! If the devil is a woman and wears perfume... this is it! I HATE THIS PERFUME!,Neutral
My mother and I went to the clothing store to select a perfume for myself and we stumbled upon this perfume. She loved it so much she almost bought it herself but decided not to because of the price. When I found it online I was so exited I bought it for her for a present. She was SO exited!She says it lasts all day and has a wonderful scent that I actually find comforting and soft. My father loves this as well. I know what to continue to get her! :) Very good product. My Mother Raved!,Neutral
I love this perfume!  So glad a friend told me about it. Cute bottle tooa RED DOOR!!  My new perfume. My new fav ...,Neutral
I have been using this fragrance for several years now and I love it.  Red Door by Elizabeth Arden and White Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor are my two favorite colognes.  I have to disagree with the negative comment on this product.  I don't feel that it is strong-scented at all.  But of course with colognes and perfumes a little goes a long way.  Any cologne that is applied too liberally will be strong and overpowering in my opinion. Love This Cologne,long way
The problem with this scent is that its getting WEAKER AND WEAKER BY THE YEAR!!!!!!!  I have to apply this three times a day now where back in the nineties I only had to apply it once and that was it.  Im not spending my hard earned money on something that I have to use X as much to get the same effect of what used to be.  Im not the only one who is noticing this WEAK AND WATERED DOWN VERSION OF PERFUME these days.  Elizabeth Arden is trending this way with all the perfumes now.  Someone  noticed this in th Avenue perfume too!  I will not be buying another bottle of this thats for sure.  Good luck Elizabeth Arden women do know the difference!!!!!!! Great Scent but..........,Neutral
I absolutely love this fragrance.  It is soft romantic and feminine.  My husband really enjoys when I wear it! A lovely gift to receive. The bottle is beautifully designed. A welcome addition to my perfume tray. I also enjoy Elizabeth Arden's Pretty! Beauty,Neutral
I bought this perfume for my mom and she has told me that the scent is pretty awesome. She likes it a lot Good scent,Neutral
my perfume smell really good it was here on time and the box was neat clean perfect seal and in good conditions the perfume was perfect pack and i love it. :) .. if u want this dont even think about it . love it,Neutral
I recommend it to those who love floral perfumes it reminds me of one very floral scent from givenchy -an old one... don't remember the name. Yes certainly good choice but not for me - for my mom as she loved the fresh smell of givenchy's  Fleur D'interdit  (searched for the name for you :) ) I hope this review helps u to make the right choice.Thanks amazon It's nice,Neutral
I have all of Elizabeth Arden's perfumes and they are my favorite!  This scent is lovely and can be worn for any occasion.  Fifth Avenue is my favorite of all but you can't go wrong with any of this collection! Wonderful!,Neutral
Word from my wife I used to wear this perfume as a teenager and bought it to wear something different. I am glad I did. It is slightly different than most perfumes and not quite as sweet. My husband likes the new scent. My wife says she is Reliving her past with an old friend,Neutral
Although I initially liked the light fragrance it does not hold at all. The staying power is zero and it is not even small enough to be carried on in your purse so u can keep spraying yourself. Waste of money and didnt know that Amazon.com did not allow perfumes to be returned. Wish I knew before ordering :( Does not last,Neutral
I had never come across this fragrance before and was looking for something new. I have my fragrance I use for special events and have enjoyed for many years.  It is a perfume and it is quite expensive.  For everyday I like a fragrance but with economical conditions as they now are I'm not using the pricey fragrance every day. Decided to take the plunge which is scary for me because I have a distinct taste in fragrance and hate anything flowery heavy or complicated with lots of things going on. Read the reviews and had to laugh at those complaining because it's supposed to be a perfume and didn't last long etc.  The label is misleading however who could possibly get genuine perfume for such a meager price.  It was exactly what I had hoped it would be; a nice pleasant citrus aroma my favorite type and who cares it doesn't last all day. I have had some awful experiences with women in Boston and New York stores spraying me without my acceptance with whatever the current trend might be that not only would last all day was repugnant and impossible to wash off. I give this a glowing review because it is very nice and I will be ordering again. Curious Before Haqppy After,Neutral
I really love this perfume is quite soft and I can take at any time especially for daily commuting exits later I recommend it so far I am very satisfied with my purchase through Amazon. My review on this product,Neutral
I love Elizabeth Arden. I've been using this since I was ....it's over  years now. I love this for my everyday wear. Not too strong but enough so it lingers. I like when my perfume lingers.....LOL Great price here on amazon so I will buy it here again. My all time everyday favourite!,Neutral
This perfume has a fresh and clean scent and like other customers said it doesn't cause any allergies. A lot of perfumes are quite strong and make me sniffle a bit when I first apply them but this one does not. I will definitely order other Elizabeth Arden perfumes and sprays in the future. Fresh and Clean!,Neutral
I think I like this scent better than my wife! Not overpowering but will last for hours. Cant go wrong with Elizabeth Arden perfumes.. Nice light scent,Neutral
I love the scent but it is another one of those perfumes that just doesn't last. I really do like it though -- if only it would last longer! Love the smell,Neutral
Green tea by EA smells like summer in a bottle. The subtle fragrance is something my mom really appreciates. Highly recommend for people who prefer something subtle since this does not have a strong fragrance like most perfumes. Green Tea By Elizabeth Arden For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray . Ounces,Neutral
I love the smell of this perfume.  The scent last the whole day that I'm in the office.  The scent is not strong. It's very light. Love it.,Neutral
Elizabeth Arden Green Tea sometimes takes a beating for a lot of reasons;some say it's too sharp at first and then simply vanishes.  Others say that they that it's a perfectly done middle of the road where it to work fragrance because there's no...vavoom to it.I actually don't think that Arden was going for vavoom when they made this one.  It's a bright CLEAN and cheerful smell.  Yes I think it's good enough to wear to a wedding etc.  I think that because it's perfectly clean and pretty without being offensive.It may be made as an elegant and happy fragrance.  It's what it smells like on me.  But then again there are elements to it that remind me of champagne.  So it's effortlessly elegant in that way.  Elizabeth Arden is just being Elizabeth Arden with this one if you know what I mean!! You could wear it with a khaki capris and sandals and smell GREAT - or you could wear it with something really dressy and smell perfectly pretty.It's not made to overwhelm I don't think.I wear TONS of perfume.  Some are pretty darned expensive - others are like this one.  But I can say this honest to God and in pure truth I get more compliments on this than I ever do wearing my favorite Chanels.  The Chanels stand on their own Ah Chanel one will smile in appreciation - no more be said.  But with this one people aren't actually sure that it's perfume really at first.  They say hmm what is that smell -  something smells nice and clean.  It makes me smile every time because I say it's Green Tea.  The reaction is always the same:  THAT is Green Tea!!?  You gotta be kidding me - I've been seeing but ignoring that stuff for years... Then they vow to check it out.  Same outcome every time.  The smell is also long lasting on me.So no there's no vavoom.  But it is effortlessly elegant and simple and a GOOD smell. Great Perfume,Neutral
Such great smell for cologne in this price range! I bought many cologne at this price range but was never satisfied like this one! i love the way my husband smells and he said this is the best smelling perfume I ever got him! Try it and you won't regret. Nothing but GREAT,Neutral
You are never fully dressed until you have on some perfume. Indeed even when wearing nothing at all (or perhaps especially when you are wearing nothing at all) you need some perfume - sweet alluring and sexy. For me my most favorite scent of all is Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds. White Diamonds is sweet without smelling too powdery or too flowery. It has an excellent scent that lasts on my skin and smells excellent.For me and the man of my life it's got to be White Diamonds. We highly recommend this wonderful perfume to you or perhaps for that special lady in you life!(Review of White Diamonds Eau de Toilette Spray Naturel . oz.) Sweet without smelling too powdery or too flowery,Neutral
This perfume make me suffocate when i gave it giftI immediately warn them about it because it give you breathing problem.And make u suffocate the smell is very strong. Very bad,Neutral
This perfume is awesome!!  It was packed so good it would of been impossible to break the bottle. Thank you so much for you thoughtfulness. The package arrived in good time and it was all good. I have got a lot of complements about how it smells. People Love to smell it on me.So I encourage  them to try it and see for there self.Again Thank you for EverythingBrenda White Diamonds,Neutral
JUST LOVE THE SMELL OF MY PERFUME ANYTHING THAT IS WHITE DIAMOND I BUY I JUST THINK IT IS AWESOME AND IT ARRIVED EARLY!!! THE JOINT!!!,Neutral
This is a fragrance I would introduce to just about anyone. It's not overpowering and can be worn daily or on a night out. I purchased this product based on reviews and was not disappointed. It has a powdery scent that is quite appealing.In addition the product was the same as described and the shipment fast. Again if your taste is similar to mine you can go ahead and add this perfume to your collection. Perfume worth buying!!,Neutral
This perfume is absoulitly intoxicating!!!!  It smells very much like Fendi's Theorema but not quite as lemmony as Theorema is but just as gorgous.  It almost gives the smell of baked cookies to me-it may just be the way my nose is percieving it but that is what it smells like to me and I cannot get enough of Elizabeth Taylors perfumes.  This is quite suprising to me also because I never thought I would go for such inexpensive perfumes but Elizabeth Taylor has outdone herself on her scent lines.  The only one perfume that I cannot tolorate is Diamonds and Rubies-way too something that does not agree with my nose.  I recommend this to EVERYONE! INTOXICATING!!!!!,Neutral
My new favorite perfume! I'm super picky about perfumes and recently I've been on a search for the perfect smell. This is light pretty and flowery. It fades as the day goes on but my husband can still smell it at night. I like how subtle it is. It reminds me if a younger woman's version of Miracle by Lancome. Get it and see for yourself :) Pleasures is a pleasure :),favorite perfume
Every time I traveled overseas I would buy my wife a coming home gift. Many times it was a bottle of parfum or cologne. This is a very light floral fragrance that accents your natural chemistry. It is not overpowering as it smells almost like a fresh bouquet of flowers. It has hints of white lily and many other light scents in it. The fragrance is so pleasant that it is more of a day perfume that gives the sensation of sunlight and spring.My wife likes this perfume a lot as it is so light. She recommends it to you. A light fragrance the gives the sensation of sunlight and spring!,Neutral
And she smell wonderful this was  years ago.I decided to get a small bottle just in case I didn't like it I would give it to her and.....Oh my god smell amazingly fresh not strong but like a fresh bouquet of flowers. I loved it.It arrive brand new. :-) My mom in-law used this perfume.....,Neutral
I was in my early ' when this perfume came out and I wore it a lot. I wear it again from time to time since I collected many favorites thru the years. It's not sweet but is feminine. One of those things that is never out of fashion. Men like it too! Takes me back in time!,Neutral
This fragrance is nice- light airy not too green not too floral not to spicy. It's a wonderful spring/summer fragrance because it's got clean floral notes it's not overwhelming to the sinuses & it doesn't overpower the woman who wears it. It's in a simple but elegant bottle which will look nice on your vanity table bathroom vanity or nightstand. I give it four stars for actual scent but would rate it as one star for it's lack of staying power.However the scent only seems to linger for a few minutes after application. It is for this reason that I must remove two stars. One for costing too much in relation to how long it lingers and one for not lasting even when layered. My housemate can faintly smell it on me right after I put it on & they like the fragrance very much. But within an hour not only can no one else smell it but if I put my nose up to the pulse points where it was applied it's as if I put nothing on. Not even a mid- or bottom note is left. It's just evaporated! If this was an inexpensive parfum OR was only an eau de toilette I'd kind of expect this. But for an eau de parfum (and not a cheap one) this should last longer. I know people say to layer which I did. Even with the matching lotion underneath (including on the pulse points) it disappears. I've never gotten any compliments on it from anyone but my housemate. Now it could be my body chemistry. However I've worn dozens of different scents over the years & always got compliments. Especially when I wore philosophy Amazing Grace people just swooned over what I wore. I have one of those lucky body chemistry's. I wear a fragrance & it stays true to scent. My mother however has trouble picking out a good fragrance for her because perfume often changes in reaction to her body chemistry. I say this just to give you an understanding of my background.I like this fragrance but for the cost it just isn't worth it to me. I want to wear something that makes me feel lovely beautiful & fresh all day- sadly this doesn't cut it. A lovely perfume but needs to be reformulated to be stronger in my humble opinion. Even perfumes that can be purchased in drugstores last longer. Nice fragrance but it just doesn't linger long enough!,Neutral
This is my girlfriend's signature scent.  I may be biased because she rocks but this perfume is regal sexy and durable - the aroma still radiates from her body in the morning. I would classify this as perfect for evening dates or whenever you dress fancily. Male opinion,Neutral
I have ordered this perfume many times and bought it from the department store  only TODAY did I realize that I this perfume was ordered for me and never arrived ! disappointed I don't know who sent it to me so I cant contact them to tell them I never got a bottle - this was meant to be a gift for me off of my wishlist,Neutral
I love Gucci Rush and was disappointed when some of the stores I normally buy it from stopped selling it.  I was so glad to be able to find it on Amazon.  It's among my top  favorites.  The smell is sexy and lasts all day.  One thing I have to say though is this perfume is more a fall/winter smell because it's not very light. Nonetheless I still love it!!! One of my favorite fragrances,Neutral
I'm also over  (an interesting demographic) but I found this perfume in an unexpected way. I was reading the excellentThe Emperor of Scent: A True Story of Perfume and Obsessionand the scientist and scent genius in the book Luca Turin gave such a compelling inexplicable description of this perfume (pp. -):Rush (Gucci)[five stars]...just a bit I loved...happened two or three hours into the story and felt like a warm breath whispering crazy things in my ear. That breath is back now strong loud irresistible a sultry wind fit to keep everyone awake and plotting indiscretions...The thing smells like a person. To be exact thanks to the milky lactone note it smells like an infant's breath mixed with his mother's hairspray.I had to find a sample first (try eBay) but I was sold immediately.I absolutely love Gucci Rush and I get more compliments when I wear than any other scent or perfume -- consistently from men and even my own husband and teen son comment every time I wear it. It's almost like they can't get enough either.I warn that it quite sweet-smelling and potent so I'm careful not to overdo spraying it on. But don't let the packaging or name prevent you from trying this luscious scent. OHHH! I can't say enough...my absolute FAVORITE scent!,Neutral
French couturier Hubert de Givenchy took the same elegant fashion style which made him famous and bottled it with Givenchy's Amarige de Givenchy. This is my perfume of choice when I want to feel sexy. The scent radiates warmth sensuality pure class and Female with a capital F. A rich complex blend of light and musky notes with Givenchy violet mimosa soft sweet spices and orange flowers is accompanied by fruity notes of fresh citrus melons peaches and plums. It is a sophisticated fragrance but not at all heavy.I prefer to wear Amarige in the evening and something less sexy a woodsy or floral cologne or Givenchy's Eau De Toilette for work and sports. This perfume has been my standby for years and although I have switched-off occasionally to try something new I always return to Amarige. I personally prefer to purchase the smaller bottle. It may just be me but I feel like scent changes or becomes stale once the bottle has been opened and kept too long. I do wear this a lot but it still takes a while to go through an entire bottle which by the way looks almost as beautiful as the perfume smells. I love it but the scent one chooses is a highly personal decision so as with all perfumes and colognes try a sample before you purchase.JANA Amarige Radiates Warmth Sensuality And Pure Class!,Neutral
love this perfume glad I found it at amazon at a reasonable price Gucci Rush,Neutral
This one is even better than the one for Women .I was looking for a perfume for my boys and I found it . This one is a keeper for me. It is manly not overpowering. What a Delight,Neutral
I'm not a fan of this perfume it smells very old fashioned/strong to me. However this was a big hit with my mother! She loved it! Old Fashioned!,Neutral
This fragrance is definitely fresh and clean. It almost reminds me of a fresh linen type of fragrance that bounces from your skin lightly and is not overpowering. I thought that I would try it because of all the wonderful reviews this fragrance has but have realized that I personally like fruity types of perfumes rather than fresh. There isn't anything wrong with the fragrance outside of this as I can see how it works really well with women that enjoy a light and fresh scent. It is definitely a clean scent.UPDATE:  There IS something unique with this fragrance that I've noticed now that it's warmer outside and I sweat more...it is actually a nice fragrance and smells so different from the way it has before. Perhaps this is what everyone that loves this fragrance is talking about in their reviews....I love it! Not for me,Neutral
This scent smells like a dated s cheap perfume. I don't even know what to do with it now. I don't see how it could benefit anyone's or anything's olfactory senses. Using it would only be torture to any creature. What does one do with a bad perfume? I'm open for suggestions. Old ish Scent,Neutral
The scent of Design is not overpowering And it isn't like every other perfume on the market.I get compliments when I where this perfume. I used to try other fragrances from time to time but in the past few years I stick to Design. I've worn this for years,Neutral
This perfume is terrific! I must say is smells heavenly! The reviews that you are reading are not wrong! It is light but pretty enough to be able to smell it! The first day I wore it I got compliments from everyone that went near me. My fiance didn't want to let go of me! It does last even if you yourself can't smell it. You've just become used to the smell! It's exactly what I wanted and more!The only thing that I could give a heads up on is the cap isn't the best so be careful when opening! Otherwise A++ Amazon! Breathtaking!,Neutral
I bought this perfume and it smells wonderful! I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. it is really strong and nice! GREAT STUFF!! great perfume!,Neutral
Im dumbfounded by the reviews on this perfume because most of them say it has a clean fresh scent. So i purchased it and it smells very musty and thick. nothing clean fresh or crisp about it. I took it to work to see if if was me and asked how others thought it smelled and they said old musty nasty etc. out of  people not a one said clean or fresh. So Im confused by the reviews here. totally confused,Neutral
I order it for her birthday and she asks for more because she gets so many complements on it. It is her favorite. my  year old aunt LOVES this perfume,Neutral
The perfume is fading away VERY quickly. In fact it is so lightly scented that even immediately after applying it I can barely smell it.I am not very fond of the fragrance either. It smells like washing up soap not the usual fresh and invigorating smell of Arden's perfumes. Disappointing,Neutral
It's not great it's not bad-- just one of those perfumes out there. It reminds me a little bit of Avon Imari-- I have a feeling that some of the major ingredients might be the same. I don't think I will buy it again. Okay!,little bit
When I saw it on Amazon I remember liking it allot years-ago--and bought it again. I am trying to remember if it smelled the same I think so.Anyway I like it!! The color of the liquid of the perfume itself is very light not dark in color the scent stay's on a very long time and the smell is not overpowering it has a baby-powder-floral-light-smell to it.I must add to that once it set's into your skin the smell has more of a lightly-sweet-floral smell to it a really nice contrast.I think this perfume is really great for daytime use at least for me you can use whenever by choice. Overall it's a really delightful fragrance!For the price hey you can't bet it!!! In my book a must have if you don't have it already!!! Bought it again still very Nice and highly pleasant!!!,long time
I use this constantly in the summer when it is hot. It is great in the morning as a facial moisturizer specially when humidity means that your lotion or cream doesn't absorb. When I start to get too hot or perspire a couple of squirts on face arms shoulders and neck are very cooling and refreshing.  It is also a great light conditioner for hair and can even be used to as a setting spray for makeup. It has a nice light fragrance that won't clash with perfume. Definitely a wonderful multi-use beauty product. Refreshing in Summer,Neutral
Unlike big Unilever maker of Dove Dr. Bronner does not combines ultra-fine exfoliating beads to clear away the old dull skin with its moisturizing milk to nurture new radiant skin. Micro Beads are fine plastic sand that end up in ocean causing harm to everything from fish to environment. What a disgrace/Apparently Dr. Bronner donated some $ dollars in favor of prop  GM labelling since that is what an honest and descent company does if they have nothing to hide in their ingredients and Dr. Bronner has nothing other than the finest organic ingredients. CERTIFIED FAIR TRADE INGREDIENTS...  I use the Baby Wash formula as shampoo and body soap with ingredients of wWater Organic Coconut Oil Potassium Hydroxide Organic Olive Oil Organic Hemp Oil Organic Jojoba Oil Citric Acid Tocopherol. No perfume or additives at all. I mix it with the same amount of water and wolla... I used to purchase one gallon few years ago but these days the price of one gallon is the same as four  oz and now I purchase  oz without storing the balance of one gallon. I replace the cap with a pump and use the bottle. I add no oil or what so ever since I am not going to use apple cider to wash the oil away. It is a simple product without any complication or garbage. So difficult to get anything simple without any additives these days but luckily the Baby Wash is one of the simple all organic ingredients out there.The Tea formula smells different but for deeper cleaning tea is better. I use it only as a body soap and shampoo on the days that I pump iron and place Vaseline on my skin otherwise the Baby Wash is the one I generally use with no smell nothing except pure organic cleaner without any additives. According to a study from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology individuals who used a shampoo with % tea tree oil reduced their dandruff % and significantly improved the itchiness and greasiness of their scalp. well there we go other benefit of this beauty.

So happy with this purchase because I love this fragrance one of my favorites.  Couldn't believe the great price I got it for especially since it was . ounces of Eau De Parfum! One of my favorite perfumes!,Neutral
I have been wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in  the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla mandarin orange peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession.My preference is more of a racy provocative alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with Obsession. The color is quite appealing reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown amber and gold tones. Obsession cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings.This is definitely a feminine scent sweet sexy and not too fruity or powerful.  There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that Obsession has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons.I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of Obsession seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties from conservative ladies to party animals.Although it is a darker color than most fragrances there is no staining on clothing but I do not wear sweaters whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips.Obsession is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of Obsession range from forty to sixty dollars. This is an obsession,Neutral
Obsession has been my signature fragrance for more than  years. I never tire of its marvelous scent and no other perfume I've tried lives up to it (for me). This is an excellent price for this size bottle so I decided to give it to myself for Christmas! This fragrance never ages,Neutral
I enjoying wearing this perfume and more importantly my significant other likes the smell of it.  It is strong though so you really don't need to use too much.  That is a good thing as it will last forever! Fabulous Scent,Neutral
Good light perfume smell similar to men's obsession. Not long lasting.. It's just ok  not so impressive..  Good for night time  party time.-HP Good... Not a strong,Neutral
This perfume is sooo nice! When you spray this perfume on you will feel sexy. The smell can definitely lift your mood in a great way! This is a must have! The smell is bliss!,Neutral
opened the box and it was truley obsession by calvin klein this smells so good and my hubby raised his eyebrows and said yeah babby that one smells good! I like it too! finally great perfume!,Neutral
I have been using it for... uhh.. fifteen years?!It is the best blend of sweetness spice musk and character I have ever smelled.There are so many perfumes especially in the last decade being launched and they all smell so similar! They have so little character and if they do then they are either too weird or too something. Or they give me a headache.This one is unique. Guaranteed. my favorite perfume of all times,favorite perfume
First off let me say I did not order this from Amazon but bought it at a dept. store.  My review is on the smell of the perfume.  It's very heavy and I didn't like it but that's my fault for not trying it before buying.  I never took it back and it sat for years on my dresser and just recently I started using it as a bathroom air freshener.  It works great for that! I just don't like wearing it on my person! :-) A Very Heavy Scent,Neutral
I used to wear Obsession years ago and was a bit afraid to purchase it online rather than Macy's and at half price.... but it was exactly as expected and the familiar fragrance is a nice change for my perfume selection. Arrived as expected,Neutral
Obsession is one of those perfumes for when the weather cools down and you pull out your winter wardrobe. I feel confident and sensual whenver I wear it. When tastefully applied Obsession is very sexy. Not so nice when overdone  squirts should be enoughIt's an oriental scent very warm and spicy with the fragrance notes of citrus vanilla and greens lowering to notes of sandalwood spices and musk.Classic timeless. A must have. Did I mention it was sexy? Sensual and Sophisticated,Neutral
This scent is fantastic.  I ordered it based on the the reviews. Beautiful. I sprayed my sheets and my body.  I went to buy groceries and  people asked me what perfume I was wearing.  It is woodsy and very original.  It does not wear off quickly.  I can't wait to wear it on a trip I am taking.  It also makes me feel happier.  The seller was very fast. Wonderful. Wonderful.,Neutral
I love this product. It has a wonderful scent which has more body than something you'd describe as light but is not heavy. I chanced on this product at the after-holiday sale in a Kroger's near me but I'll be buying more of it whenever needed from Amazon. Best part? It works as a perfume spray! Spray up and walk through the fallout. You'll smell just as good as your house! I'll be buying again and again,Neutral
I Have work Frank and Myrrh for years and there isn't a single day when someone doesn't stop and beg to know what perfume I'm wearing.  For the price it's out of this world.  It's also an oil and lasts a long time.  I hope to never be without this. My favorite perfume,favorite perfume
This natural blend smells very much like Opium perfume.  It is rich and warm and not a light scent.  It lasts - and I often spray it over my bedding.  Since it is a natural blend it needs to be shaken before using.  It is an unusual combo not easy to find. rich and aromatic arom,Neutral
I first found Zum Mist in a local natural food store in my city. It was in the fragrance section and I was looking for a new perfume to wear. The bottle said it was a room spray but that a person could also wear it. I loved the frankincense  and myrrh so bought that first. ( now I have  or  different kinds)I am not kidding when I say that I have been stopped at least  times in the last year or  and asked what I am wearing when I wear it. - and I am not that social of a gal. I imagine if I was out and about more frequently even more people would have asked. People who asked me were just regular everyday people at Wal-Mart or even in the bus stop. It smells GREAT! - and a whole bottle lasts me for a year at least.  You only need about  or  squirts. The scent lasts and is very powerful. I love this stuff. My kids love it now too and when they are on trips I love when they tell me the packages I send smell like mom. ( frankincense and myrrh.) People stop me and ask what I'm wearing,Neutral
I love Mane 'n Tail Original Conditioner and the Shampoo.  I use the Conditioner to actually wash my hair - using the Conditioner Only method (google that) :)  A couple of times a month I use the Mane 'n Tail Original Shampoo.  I also use the shampoo (original) for a body wash.  Been using these for years along with coconut oil for my long hair.  This product however adds extra oomph and shine and strength.  Even though I have very fine hair - it doesn't weigh it down at all.  I LOVE LOVE the smell - wish I could wear it as perfume.  I hope they keep this scent and this product exactly as it is.  The jam-like scent description is accurate.  Depending on how I wear my hair - I will either use the conditioner as a hair dressing or this Enriched Hair Strengthener.  GREAT products at affordable prices.  LOVE! Mane 'n Tail is the BEST,Neutral
I have bleach damaged asian hair which I am trying to grow out so I can chop off the damaged hair. I am using the Mane n' Tail shampoo (which REALLY works!!!!) and thought I should give this a try since it's the same line. But the first thing I noticed was the awful smell. I thought this product had gone bad but when I read the other reviews other people commented on the smell as well. I am sorta sensitive to smell for example if I go to Sephora and try sampling more than  different perfumes I will get a headache and feel nauseous. I could not try out this product long enough to see the results because of the smell. But if you are not too sensitive to smell maybe you should give it a try. The shampoo definitely works maybe this does too? Smells funky,Neutral
Fruity & Delicious- was my first opinion. I never thought I would like a fruity scent like this one but i did love it. It lasted really long on me the first day i tried it. Havent been feeling it to last as well now that I use it everyday(perhaps I am used to the smell now?)Thats why a star is missing but overall like the perfume. Looks cute too! Fruity & Delicious,Neutral
I actually like this. Which is surprising because I don't like apples at allnot in perfume or just regular old plain apples. But this is a great. It has the smell of a fresh ripe and crisp green apple. I can't stop using this perfume! I love it! Not a big Apple perfume fan but i like it!,Neutral
I received the Be Delicious perfume on time. Thank you. I usually get the . oz perfume. This one is too big to carry in my purse but it is one of my favorite scents. Thanks again! Perfume Arrived On Time,Neutral
I've been wearing this scent for the majority of the last five years taking a break for a few months here or there to try other perfumes but I always come crawling back to Delicious. I literally get complimented on my smell almost every day when I wear this and have actually had people say wow you smell delicious what are you wearing? It's light fruity and doesn't smell like chemicals like so many perfumes do. One spray on my throat and one on the wrist lasts me all day without wearing off and it doesn't smell gross when it interacts with my sweat. You have to be really careful about choosing a perfume that works with your body chemistry. Delicious is my favorite! Perfect.,Neutral
Nothing bad to say about this....love it My # perfume,Neutral
I thought I liked this perfume when I smelled the sample that came in the department store's catalog.  I hinted around enough that I had to have it! and so I got it as a birthday present.  Well let me just say I don't ware it!  It's kind of masculine in my opinion and also a little soapy maybe.  The truth is I can't put my finger on exactly why I don't like it.Of course I love the bottle for its uniqueness!  I think it's time I face perfume facts: Just because I like the bottle doesn't mean I will like the scent...  stars because I like the bottle,Neutral
I love this perfume!! So light and fruity! Great summer scent! And the bottle is adorable! Great gift for any woman! My Favorite Scent!,Neutral
I've always been a girl for sweet fruity type of scents. This perfume is awesome. It was given to me as a birthday gift a couple of years ago and it's still my favorite. The scent is sweet without being overwhelming. Whenever I wear it I get a lot of compliments. The cost for the perfume is a well worth investment. Enticingly Sweet Scent,Neutral
I really loved the bright apple tones of Be Delicious it was very fresh and clean. However it faded quite fast. It left me with a boring powdery perfumey scent that I found old fashioned. I was actually quite surprised and expected a much more lasting and consistent scent for the price. If the scent had stayed the same as when I first put it on I would have given a high rating as it starts out great. Fades quickly powdery finish,Neutral
I had only smelled this perfume in magazine samples but loved it then.  So I decided to order it.  It was so worth it.  It is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled.  Very fruity and everyone compliments me on how I smell.  If you like fruity/floral this is perfect for you. Wonderully smelling perfume!,Neutral
I got this perfume after a coworker of mine gave me a sample. I loved it right away and had to buy some. I've received several compliments from coworkers and friends about it. I will definitely buy more in the future! It's a soft fragrance but it stays and that's what I like about it the best! Love this scent!,Neutral
Wonderful thick moisturizer! I have bought hundreds of beauty products over the years trying to get my sensitive acne prone skin to behave. This does not make me break out at all and makes my skin feel silky smooth after all the drying natural products I use for acne. It does have a bit of an odd perfume that might take a bit of getting used to but I now equate the scent with softness. One of my favorite things about it is that it does not burn or make my sensitive skin turn fire engine red like the super expensive dermatologist recommended products I was previously using. I guess my skin was just telling me to go organic. I'm so glad that I did! Creates Fantastic Soft Skin Without Breakouts!,sensitive skin
It lathers well and has a light clean scent.  The scent doesn't linger which works well for me because I work in an office where we aren't allowed to wear perfume.  A little goes a long way as this foams up nicely especially with a mesh pouf.  It does moisturize better than most body washes.  I used to useSoftsoap Body Butter Coconut Scrub Body Wash  oz and if I didn't use lotion my legs would just flake dry skin.  I was able to tryDove Creme Body Wash Visible Care Toning  Ounceand was impressed with it as my skin was much less dry then when I use the Softsoap bodywash.  This bodywash moisturizes my skin as well as the Dove Visible Care Toning does.Dove clearly has a superior line of bodywashes that moisturize better then others.  I am satisfied with it and will use it again in the future. Light scent moisturizing and washes clean,long way
This Dove unscented body wash replaces the former Dove Unscented Body Wash in their line.  I find that while this one is just as creamy and nourishing as the original this one has a lot of fragrance in the product despite its claim of being unscented.  The old version was truly unscented.Comparing this to the new line of Dove body products it seems that they have increased the amount of fragrance used in all their new products and this new body wash would seem unscented by comparison when in reality it should be described as moderately scented.I tried testing this product out on my hands before trying it on my body in case of an allergic reaction but the scent of this unscented body wash was so strong that it gave me a headache from just from the residual perfumes on my hand.  However my hands did feel soft and more moisturized.A big thumbs down to Dove for false advertising and for discontinuing their true unscented bodywash.  NOT recommended for those seeking a lightly-scented or fragrance-free product. NOT Unscented!,Neutral
So this product did pretty much as it advertises. It cleaned me gently - it did not leave my skin dry like some soaps do.Whatever moisturizers it has must have absorbed into my skin because I didn't feel greasy. It had a nice clean fragrance. This is important to me because I don't want anything that either interferes with my perfume or is so annoyingly strong that it gives me a headache. The price seems to be right in line with other like products.I think my skin is just too old to feel soft and smooth just from using a particular type of soap.BUT I will keep buying this soap for all the other positives it has behind it. Mostly as Advertised at Least For Me,Neutral
Our family has long been a fan of Dove soaps.  As my wife and I have gotten a bit older both of us have issues with our skin getting dry in the winter.Dove Sensitive works as advertised.  While not strong enough to make dry skin soft again it does provide enough moisture to help keep my skin from drying out.  Dove Sensitive Skin feels like it rinses away cleaner than other Dove formulas.  This product did not irritate the skin of my wife and daughter who break out from certain soaps.The first thing I noticed was that this soap does not seem as thick as other Dove formulas our family uses.  However when put on a body pouf there is not as much lather created.  I still came out of the shower clean but I just like the formulas with more lather.One thing I found fascinating is that the bottle says it is unscented.  While I am fairly certain that there are no added perfumes there definitely is a characteristic Dove scent to this product.This is a product I would not hesitate to use again. Keeps Skin Moisturized As Advertised,dry skin
These Dove body washes are European-style cleansers used with a washcloth or loofah and they don't produce much lather. They do clean well and leave the skin feeling soft almost like lotion has been applied to it.The Sensitive Skin version is not truly unscented--it has an almost undetectable floral undertone but overall has a smell similar to the generic unscented body lotion that comes in a little bottle at the hospital not offensive at all.The Deep Moisture version has a rich tropical floral scent that is very heavy and extremely long-lasting. I can't quite pin it down but it is something like a combination of passion fruit and tuberoses that fades into bergamot. I am sensitive to most perfumes and was surprised that this doesn't give me a headache especially since it is so strong.There is also a Go Fresh version elsewhere on Amazon with a moderate scent of nectarine and white ginger with a whiff of mandarin orange.The bottles are a bit awkward to grasp when they are full and wet because of the size and the way they are curved and the tab on the cap is almost sharp and not pleasant to open and close. I put them in a bottle with a pump dispenser which works well. Good moisturizing body wash,sensitive skin
I really do like the feel of this body wash. It lathers well and one generous dollop is enough for my whole body in the shower -- with the exception of my face on which I use a facial wash. I'm not too crazy about the smell though and I understand that perfumes can cause problems. I would just like to have the option to buy other fragrances. The bottle is very hard and thick and it does get difficult to squeeze out the product. It helps to reform the bottle and make sure it has air in it. It will not stand on its top and since the tip is so small it doesn't even lean well. That being said the top is easy to open in the shower.My skin does feel smoother and less dry when I use the product.It's a pretty good price compared to other body washes. Nice Lather,Neutral
I've been using this body wash for almost a week and am very pleased with the result. It's the dead of winter here and this season is brutal in my part of the country not just cold but the air is very dry. Chapped skin is almost a given moisturizers and lotions a necessity.One of the reasons this product appealed to me was because it is a moisturizing body wash. So while exfoliation is also desired the standard net poof I use to apply all body washes accomplishes that goal. My hope was that this product while cleansing would not leave my skin feeling dry and it didn't. The feeling left on my skin from the Dove is soft and smooth. I still use body lotion but my skin seems to be slightly more moisturized before applying my usual cream. I am attributing this change to the body wash.I do not have extremely sensitive skin but whenever possible like to avoid unnecessary ingredients which is another reason why I wanted to try this product. This brings me to my only complaint - it isn't unscented.I choose unscented products because layering perfumes from deodorants soaps and various creams one on top of another is offensive to me and I assume to a large portion of the people around me. If I wish to wear a fragrance I will but I would prefer all basic toiletry items remain unscented. So the fact that this body wash has a definite scent when it claims to be unscented is unfortunate and disappointing. With that one caveat I liked the product itself just not its smell. Dove Sensitive Skin Moisturizer -- Not Unscented,sensitive skin
As a guy I never gave the Dove brand a chance until I took a medication that dried out my skin.  My doctor recommended it and ever since I've been hooked.  What makes it great is that it leaves the skin clean without drying it out and does not include any perfumes that might irritate the skin.  The Sensitive Skin Dove body wash is the liquid equivalent of the classic soap.  There is no lingering fragrance with the only scent being similar to an unscented lotion.  This scent is only present during use since it washes off so cleanly.The texture of this body wash is just like lotion.  I even double-checked the bottle to make sure that I hadn't accidentally brought lotion into the shower!  My fear was that it would not get me clean or rinse off well but it did both.I still primarily use bar soap but if you prefer body wash or need something portable for the gym/travel Dove has done a good job of making a liquid that retains the properties of the bar. Gentle Clean,sensitive skin
This is a great body wash. I normally use the scented body washes but gave this a try. It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized which is impressive considering the air here is devoid of any moisture this time of year. I've always had this experience with Dove products though.As for how it works in the shower the bottle has a convenient arrowhead shape. It's easy to pour the body wash out and it doesn't run down the sides of the bottle. It lathers well and a little goes a long way. Also it says it's unscented it does contain fragrance and smells like a bar of dove soap. The fragrance is very mild though so it doesn't interact with my perfume later on.I definitely recommend this body wash or anything by Dove. They make great products. Great Wash for Dry Winter Skin!,long way
I have very very very sensitive and dry skin.  Living in Alaska where homes are typically more dry than the world's deserts doesn't help.  Oh and we have forced air heat.  Dry dry dry...So I'm pretty tough to please with body washes.  There aren't many that I can use without needing moisturizer afterwards.  This body wash by Dove is one of the few!I love the way this smells; nice and clean and not overly perfumed.  It lathers nicely without parching my skin and wonder of wonders I can wash and go!  Thank you Dove for giving me five extra minutes to hit the snooze button!This body wash arrived all contained in the bottle and not dripping through the packaging material.  Whomever taped over the dispenser end thank you!  Please teach the rest of the world about shipping liquid soaps!Nice product + safe and non-oozy arrival.  What's not to love?!? Lovely.,dry skin
After using bar soap for a few months I'd forgotten how nice a creamy bodywash could feel in comparison!  I think I'm firmly vowing never to go back to bar soap again if I can help it!This Dove Body Wash is nicely creamy with an easy lather for the shower.  It doesn't feel excessively greasy or chalky and there's no strongly perfumed scents to the liquid.  Given that I have very sensitive skin every soap is a new chance for itching and irritation.  Strong scents can give me a headache and many soaps leave me  uncomfortable for hours after showering.  After using Dove's soap for two weeks my skin feels remarkably better less prone to itching even in the dryness of the winter and without any residue left over.I'd happily buy this particular product and use it regularly in the shower.  But there is one slight problem.  This twenty four ounce container is big and it's heavy!  It's very awkward to grip it well in the shower--particularly with wet hands.  I'd recommend anyone who buys this consider putting the soap in a smaller dispenser to actually use in the shower--this container is a tad too unwieldy to make it really work well.  Other than that--no complaints!Happy bathing! ^_^ Shanshad Splish Splash some Soap for the Bath!,sensitive skin
I've tried a number of other body washes and they either reek of perfume or they lack the ability to keep my skin moisturized throughout the day. Dove Fresh Body Wash &#; and most of the Dove bodywash line &#; are hands down the best body washes.Another plus is that it doesn't smell like a men's body wash or a lady's body wash so I'm able to order one body wash for use for the whole house. The best line of body wash period.,Neutral
I routinely buy unscented products because I am hypersensitive to the icky perfume-y scents that get added to so many personal and household products. (They give me blinding headaches.)  Dove body wash does a good job of keeping my now-dry skin from turning to dust so when I saw that this particular version of it was unscented for sensitive skin I jumped at the chance to try it.Unscented?  Not so much.  Granted the scent is mild and fairly unobjectionable but it has a distinct scent unlike a great many other personal care products which promise that they're unscented and actually mean it.  No I'm not saying that unscented means scent-free.  I'm saying that when unscented Dove body wash smells exactly like scented Dove body wash albeit to a lesser degree then the product isn't actually unscented.That said let me go on to point out that it really does clean without drying.  I won't say that I notice my skin is markedly nicer after using it but it's not itchy and flaking which is a blessing during a Chicago winter.  I can't speak to the hypo-allergenic quality since my skin isn't what's sensitive to additives. Not quite as advertised,sensitive skin
This is my signature fragrance. It is my go to for day for night for work or just when I want to have that light crisp breezy scent. It's hard to describe a fragrance with words. On me this fragrance leaves a light citrusy airy almost seaside fragrance. I get numerous compliments when I wear this fragrance. It also lasts a very long time. The product that I purchased on Amazon seem to be authentic and in its original bottle. This is important because there are many forgeries out there many imitation perfumes and colognes. I wear this often enough and I usually purchase it from a Department store so I am convinced that this is the real deal. I would not hesitate to purchase this again at this reasonable price.I would caution buyers to be careful what they pay for this fragrance or any other on Amazon. If it looks like it's too good of a deal then it probably is. We know that the vendors change from time to time and the store I purchased from on Amazon may not be the same one that you do. So please take the time to read the reviews look at the current price and compare it to what it would cost in a department store. It's always buyer beware on the Internet. My signature cologne,long time
Smells wonderful. Very close to Avon's Clean Cotton Comfort Scents line that has been long discontinued. This reminds me of summer fresh lemon starched sheets. Sounds strange for a perfume but it truley is a simple clean and feminine scent. Fresh and clean,Neutral
This is the fragrance my wife loves.It smells great on her but lets be honest here dudes... she doesn't wear it just because I like it.  She really likes it.One piece of advice:  buy it directly from Amazon to make sure you get the real quality merchandise.There is never an excuse for not knowing what to buy a woman.  You can give them jewelry flowers chocolates and perfume and if they are a good person they will appreciate it even if they take it back for something that suits them better.  (for men its knives tools wallets belts etc)  These are the staples of gift giving and perfume has the advantage that it gets used up and you can replace it every few years.Anyway I don't have much else to say.  My wife loves it and happy wife happy life. My wife loves it,Neutral
This is the best smelling perfume!  I had run out of it and got a really great deal through Amazon!  I love this stuff!  It last a long time too! Great!,long time
I am terrible about what fragrances I wear.  I can't stand sweet or musk or flowery stuff. I just wanted a clean scent and I finally found it! It is the perfect blend of clean and unit still femine. THe D&G Light Blue is clean with just a tiny tiny touch of citrus if you are really smelling it.  I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  It is not heavy so you do need to use it generously.  My only complaint is you need a mid day touch up and the scent does fade by then but other than that this is the clean great smelling fragrance you are looking for! No Better &#;Clean&#; Perfume Out There,Neutral
Add this to the files of perfumes almost everyone loves except me. I wish I loved this more than I did but I just don't. I love the citrus topnotes that I smell on first sniff but underneath those there's this weird musky smell that's not light and summery at all- more masculine and after-shavey. When wearing this I ended up smelling like a man and I'd rather smell this scent on a guy than on me. Too masculine for me,Neutral
My husband somehow managed to purchase a bottle of this on a flight from Amsterdam back to the US without me seeing or knowing!  He knew that I always sprayed this scent on me whenever we traveled and I wandered in to those airport duty-free perfume shoppes.  I am very easily irritated by smells and perfume can get really overwhelming really quickly.  This doesn't do that at all.  It has a nice light scent that blends in well with my own scent.  If I had to describe it I'd say it's a blend of citron cedar a tart apple maybe a light rose and a slight musk.I wish I could afford to get the lotions body wash etc. it's THAT good. The most wonderful clean scent,Neutral
THIS PERFUME SMELLS SOOOOOO GOOD. SO FRESH AND IT REALLY LAST ALL DAY. EVERYONE ALWAYS COMPLIMENTS ME ABOUT IT AND ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IM WEARING. I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY IF I WERE YOU! MY FAVORITE SCENT,Neutral
i would buy again smelll good  for price it was gift good smelling perfume buy it love it to wear every day smells light,Neutral
This is a very good flat iron spray that allows my flat iron to glide through my hair almost effortlessly. Most other straightening sprays I've tried have a bit of stickiness to them and I was skeptical but it does a nice job & leaves my hair shiny. I do small sections at a time lightly mist and and then flat iron it-- it's that easy and it even has a nice smell. The smell doesn't linger for long though so you don't need to worry about it clashing with your perfume. One can goes a long way so it's a good value and it helps to minimize the damage you can do with heat styling. If you're noew to flat ironing your hair or just looking for a new spray this is a great one to start. I highly recommend it. Excellent flat iron spray,long way
I'll be honest - I only bought this because my favorite perfume doesn't have a conventional cap and could not use it with my Travalo.  I thought this would be a good alternative because I could spray it directly into the glass bottle and take it with me.  The first day I got this I loved it.  It was so easy to use and it seemed to be secure.  However after a couple of days it started to leak in my purse.  At first I wasn't sure if it was because I hadn't screwed it on tight enough but when I went to unscrew it I noticed it was definitely tightened as much as it could go.  I have no idea how this leaked since it seemed to be secure but it did and I wasn't happy to see that my expensive perfume was totally wasted.  At least two good things came out of this: () Luckily I didn't fill it up completely in the first place specifically for the purpose of having leaky atomizers in the past (lesson learned) and () at least my handbag smells good! :/ Leaks!,favorite perfume
There are several things I didn't like about this. The bottle inside is not secure it leaked it is glass and it is difficult to transfer my pretty expensive perfume from its bottle to this one.I found another bottle on Amazon called Travelo that is perfect and I love everything about it. It did not waste one drop of my perfume while transferring. It is perfect for traveling and it is cute. There is something better,Neutral
Not only is this a terrific size for those &#;super expensive&#; fragrances you might just want to get a decant of it's seriously easy to use looks beautiful in purse of perfume drawer and spray works beautifully. The price was right on this one as well. Can't say enough props for this generously sized atomizer. In fact put Chanel Sycomore in it if that's any indication! Price check but can feel secure with this purchase. Also perfect for traveling when you're bringing only  or  perfumes and can use this for the &#;special one. A Special Perfume Deserves a Special Spray,Neutral
Very hard to open for filling.  Once filled I took it on a trip and carefully sealed it in a ziplock bag.  Perfume was completely evaporated by the time I arrived.  Junk.  Too large also. Don't bother.  Just another junky item.,Neutral
Though its a small bottle it holds a lot of perfume.  I got one for me and one for my husband's cologne to take the plane. Works perfectly and can't beat the price. Perfect for travel,Neutral
This was a gift for someone. They are very happy with this since its perfect for the type of perfume bottles that they use. Convenient,Neutral
these things are pretty monstrous. I haven't even used them yet because they hold wayyyy too much perfume. I ended up ordering another set that came with  and they're much smaller. This set is fit more for if you wanna pack ONE perfume for like several days in one bottle. I'm more the kinda person who carries a few different perfumes at a time.Wouldn't recommend unless you use the same perfume everyday. didn't realize it'd be so big,Neutral
My go to product for a little bit if texture and that slept in hair look. Does have a slight perfume smell but it smells good. Wonderful!,little bit
This is such an excellent classic powder. I'm not super fair but fairly light and the Translucent is truly translucent on me. It's very fine milled light and silky and is difficult to overapply (I have slightly oily skin) and produces a matte but dewy and natural finish not caky or powdery looking. A large dense kabuki brush gives me the best finish. I've found loose powder to be the best way to set and cover the shine from heavy facial sunscreen and Coty is my favorite; it will keep a very oily sunscreen under control and looking decent for over  hours on a warm day.I love the scent. It's old fashioned and classic and really not too strong (I'm a perfume snob and don't want to use anything that will clash with my favorite scents and the scent of Coty hasn't been a problem). I find it fades quickly in the  or  minutes after applying. I'm told that the specific scent used is L'Origan one of Coty's old classic perfumes.And it's dirt cheap at around $ for a huge canister that will last forever. I like the new plastic jars they're much more convenient and practical than cardboard. The cardboard boxes were charming but cardboard for packing cosmetics has definitely had its day and I'm glad the packaging is more modern now with a handy built in sifter and a lid that closes tightly and keeps out moisture effectively.ETA: For those who really dislike the scent there IS an unscented version! I found it at the ubiquitous store that starts with a K. The key if you want the same matte finish as the original scented Air Spun is to look for the blue container that says Fragrance free translucent on the back NOT Fragrance free luminous translucent. The Luminous one is pearlescent and will look visibly different through the jar compared to the classic formula. Now when I don't have time to dither about what perfume to wear I use the scented version and if I'm wearing perfume I use the fragrance free. Couldn't ask for more in a powder,Neutral
Nothing smells better than just clean.  However if one was to use an alluring scent there can be nothing better than a classically proven one.  With the plethora of scents reinventing them selves each year this is one of the few that are immediately recognizable.  For mature people it brings back memories; for the young it creates them.The container is small enough and the essence is concentrated enough that you can transport it with you and use it when the time comes.  However perfume will last quite a long time.Also there are two camps with it comes to perfume.  The first is acrid chemical smells more on the line of fly spray.  The second (including White Shoulders) is natural scents in this case more in the line of flowers. Gardenia lilac amber oakmoss and jasmine on my mind,Neutral
My mom wore White Shoulders when I was growing up and I swore I would never wear that perfume.  Well guess what?  She wore it for a reason and it's still available for a reason.  It's just timeless and smells good every time I put it on. Timeless,Neutral
This has been my favorite fragrance for years and years so I was happy to find it on Amazon at a super price compared to Macy's. I have had many people ask me what perfume I was wearing because they liked it so well. At Amazon's price I can wear it every day. Most favorite,Neutral

have you ever been somewhere and somebody smells really goodwell I am the kind of person who asks what perfume they are wearing.... times out of  it was Jessica Mcclintock.I love flowery light scents and this is one of the best...also Amazon has it for much less than others...enjoy spring all year round like a field of flowers,Neutral
I GOT A SAMPLE OF JM AND LIKED IT A LOT. CITRUS AMD LILLY? A GOOD BALANCE OF SWEET AND TART. THE SEALED BOTTLE COST MORE BUT IT'S WORTH IT TO KNOW THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. A GOOD EVERYDAY SCENT AND GOOD ADDITION TO THE REPERTOIRE OF PERFUMES. GOOD SCENT,Neutral

I have  or  favorite scents that I wear according to my mood and to the environment(s) I will be wandering through leaving my fragrance behind. Jessica McClintock Eau de Parfum is indeed a very special scent which brings out the whimsical romantic the feminine girly-girl in me.This light poetic innocent extremely uplifting scent evokes the first flowers of spring fresh delicate blooms with just a touch of green. The perfume which debuted in  has wonderful top notes of black currant bergamot and basil. The longer lasting base notes include a delicate white flower blend of lily of the valley white jasmine rose and ylang-ylang along with subtle hints of citrus musk and sandalwood.I wear this perfume day and night especially in the hot spring and summer months but also during winter evenings and at work. It really picks up my spirits and is an excellent natural mood enhancer on a gloomy day. As always I am careful never to apply too much - just a spritz at pulse points. I do carry a purse size refresher with me.The Jessica McClintock Design House of San Francisco has long been associated with clothing that blends fantasy and romance. I have many friends who wore this perfume on their wedding day - very appropriately. One of the reasons I am writing this review is that the relatively new Vera Wang fragrance seems to be the upcoming romantic/bridal favorite. While I really like Vera Wang both her designs and perfume I don't think her scent is comparable to Jessica McClintock. When you go the perfume counter or store next try the samplers and see for yourself.Highly recommended! ENJOY!JANA This totally romantic extremely uplifting scent evokes the first flowers of spring.,Neutral
Diorissimo has always been my default summer fragrance but I'm down to the last quarter inch in my last bottle.  It is alas discontinued.Jessica McClintock's signature fragrance is very close and may even be better.  It's a white flower fragrance from gardenia to orange blossom to lily but with green notes that keep it from being too sweet or cloying.  It's light but lasts. My husband even likes it and he hates overpowering perfumes.The price on Amazon is a steal. Lovely summer fragrance,Neutral
This perfume smell good but it don't last long on your skin but on your clothes it do for a long time so if u a person that like it on your clothes then your skin a must get Smell good,long time
What can anyone say about this fragrance except I love this perfume.  I always receive many compliments.  A very feminine and beautifully soft floral.  Long lasting but not overly potent.  A welcome addition to any fragrance collection. By far one of my favorite scents at a huge savings in comparison to department store prices! Jessica Mclintock,Neutral
I bought this perfume because I liked how it smelled on someone else.  However I have to say that I was really dissappointed when I used it.Firstly I found that I had to spray a lot of it to really be able to smell the frangrance.  Then I realized that I did not like how it smelled on me.  It seemed to have a chemical scent on my own skin.  I wish I would have gotten a tester of it before deciding to buy . oz worth.I do have to have to say that I gave it to  stars only because I happened to like how it smelled on someone else.  So I would not discount it completely.  I would encourage you to make sure it smells good on you personally before choosing to purchase this perfume. Test it first,Neutral
It has been many years since I used this perfume.  I boght it in department store when it was on same with intention to recapture my younger years by wearing this fragrance that woudl remind me of time passed.  Perfume comes in a very attractive looking white box with Jessica McClintock logo on it.  The perfume bottle itself comes in a nice sqaure bottle with white top that reminds you this is white flower fragrance perfume.Although ingredients list that perfume has white roses jasmine citrus and basil in it; predominant notes are white jasmine and lilly of the valley.  It is light perfume the kind one can wear in a daytime.  It is suitable for younger women and I like it very much.  It does nto stay on for too long but thta is true for most white flower perfumes anyway.All I can say it is fun perfume light and the price is right.  Give it a try.  It is perfect to wear in the hot summer day. Light perfume of white flowers,Neutral
this is the au de parfume better than au de toillette. great perfume and if you can find the $ml for below $ go for it! tax free at JFK will be more expensive have bought it before. loved the price!,Neutral
NICE ORIENTAL SPICE ALONG THE LINES OF MAGIE NOIR TYPE OF PERFUME.  IT JUST DOES NOT LAST LONG THOUGH.  I HAVE NOTICED THAT THEY ARE WATERING DOWN THE PERFUMES THESE DAYS AND YOUR MONEY'S WORTH IS BECOMING A THING OF THE PAST.  SO WITH THAT IN  MIND IM NOT SURE I WOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER BOTTLE BUT IT IS A WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE FOR AS LONG AS IT LASTS. BEAUTIUDL SCENT!!!,Neutral
I bought it for my mother - this perfume is what she usually uses but very difficult to find in stores. I researched prices and reviews and at the end decided to go with amazon. My mother had no complains and she still uses perfume so I think its safe to assume I will be buying again for next Christmas. Liked it,Neutral
It looks like hardened Vasoline coming from the tube.  It smells like perfumed Vasoline.  It is very thick and greasy. Weird stuff,Neutral
A friend often wore this to holiday events and I always loved the fragrance.  I am VERY particular as strong perfumes and after shaves nauseate me.  I finally bought my own bottle of Alfred Sung some years ago then a friend bought me some for Xmas and I recently ran out and bought this bottle through Amazon.  Still love it.  It's my identifying fragrance. my third bottle,Neutral
Nice floral scent but looses strong scent quickly. Most perfumes hang on you at least a little through out the day this one does not. Great for a brief hour of scent. Floral strong but looses scent very quickly,Neutral

Oh poopers. I was hoping for green.Well Sung *is* green just not *my* kind of green. Sung is bright fresh Spring green. Girlie-girl green. Wearing a frock made of frugly drapes and singing-Sound-of-Music-in-a-meadow green. Sung *is* THAT kind of green which immediately disqualifies it as *my* kind of green.Sung opens *so* LOV that it's scary. It could be Coty's Mugeut de Bois. The LOV is enveloping and lovely perhaps perfect if *your* kind of green is LOV. Mine isn't.Wow the LOV just won't go away. I am sensitive to many white florals. Sung was asthma-inducing. Love you Alfred Sung but not your namesake perfume.The bottle has simple lines and is gorgeous. On the other hand the black plastic integrated spray on top ... not so much ... cheap & tacky.There are a few perfume critics who say 'women should not smell like flowers.' Sung is a bed of LOV. 'Nuf said. Not my kind of floral,Neutral
This is my sister's favorite perfume/cologne which I can not find in any of the discount stores in my community.  I found it at a discount on Amazon.  I now have a happier sister. Favorite,Neutral
The thing about this fragrance is it always gets me compliments whenever I wear it. I enjoy the long lasting scent and my husband who knows I love perfume always notices when I am wearing this perfume. I have had many bottles over the years and try many different brands but always come back to this one. Amazing,Neutral
I purchased the Bulgari Aqua for my husband because a friend told me the smell was really good. I can say that I am very pleased with the purchase as is my husband. As always Amazon delivered the product in time and I don't have any complain. I recommend this perfume to anyone. Smells really good,Neutral
I bought this perfume and the scent is truly excellent. Very soft but the scent remains for several days in my body. and the best part was the price. I needed a perfume,Neutral
I switch perfumes after each one finishes which is usually one every month. Well I have used this Bvlgari two consecutive months and I am going for a third which may be a record. This perfume is excellent. Gentle not overpowering long lasting. Great smell. Smooth and cool,Neutral
I love to use every day it is fresh durable and smells like when you get out off the shower. Very good cost- benefit. day by day perfume,Neutral
A caramelly-vanilla deliscious concoction it will remind you of something wonderful to eat but is more complex than today's sweet fragrances.It's a mystery why this perfume apparently never caught on and thus is available here for a great price. Smells expensive and best for fall/winter. Reminds me a bit of Angel and Chantilly if that makes any sense. One spritz is nice and not too loud for the office but this could be a special date-night fragrance as well. Unique aroma that not everyone is wearing and great value. sweet and warm,Neutral
I work in a clinic and walked by a patient one day who happened to be wearing this gorgeous warm sweet and rich-smelling perfume. I asked what she had on and she told me Wish...I became obsessed and knew I had to have it!! I'm a little nervous buying it without having tried it on myself first so I hope it smells just as good on me as it did on her. I can't wait to receive my order!! Bottle looks beautiful too. Hopefully there won't be any issues with product color/age like was mentioned in a few earlier reviews...the color of the perfume in the amazon picture looks very old! :-(UPDATE: I got my perfume last night. Absolutely no problem at all with color/age/packaging - box was wrapped and perfume is a gorgeous blue color. The bottle is the most beautiful one I've ever owned! The scent is very...transformative. I sprayed a tiny bit into the box at first and it smelled very much like Thierry Mugler's Angel which I am not a huge fan of. Then I sprayed it on my wrists and I thought it smelled like cheap soap. Then a bit later it morphed into the gorgeous sweet delicious smell I must have smelled on our patient and I was soooooo excited and could not stop smelling myself. Unfortunately that smell changed again a few hours later and I'm left with a dry-down that smells a bit like something my grandma used to wear. :(  I love my grandma to pieces but I don't want to smell like her. I asked  friends for their opinions today; one said It smells classic not old lady and the other two proffered old lady without me even asking leading questions. So I'm not quite sure about it. I think I'll wear it this weekend and see what I think. I will probably keep it though just because the bottle is so gorgeous and I want to be able to smell the lovely phase  scent. ;) Buying on a whim!,Neutral
I LOVE the smell of this perfume. It smells amazing. However nobody I know has ever even noticed that I'm wearing it. I can smell it when I first put it on and a few minutes later I can't smell it anymore. I sprayed myself all over with like  spritzes once and by the time I got to my boyfriend's house the smell was gone. I told him I got a new perfume and he put his face right up where I sprayed it and he couldn't tell that I was wearing anything. Maybe I got a bad batch :/ Love the smell but it doesn't last!,Neutral
This stuff is completely intoxicating. My favorite perfume of all time is Casmir by Chopard and this one is just as wonderful though different. You can really smell the incense. It's a coy and alluring scent. Really Fantasti,favorite perfume
First off I did not buy my bottle on Amazon. It is ridiculously overpriced. Also beware of knock-offs and imitations.Now onto the perfume. This scent is pure heaven. It has a very bright luminous luxurious sensual happy and confident scent full of sunshine and love. I wear this scent when I want to feel special as it is very glamorous. I do not see how anyone could dislike this although some people find it mature too cloying or boring. It is very perfumey and has long lasting power. A true masterpiece! Its notes are considered: floral fruity white floral watery and sweet. I just love this perfume! absolutely divine fragrance!!,Neutral
This perfume is a must have.  It is romantic warm fragrance that smells good on almost everyone.  I would recommend it be worn as an evening fragrance.  It may be too strong for daytime wear.  I have used this perfume for years and it never goes out of style.  It is a classic.  It would be a great gift!  The bottle is great too. Must Have,Neutral
I was gifted this perfume when I was a teenager and fast forward years later I am still addicted to this perfume. As with any name brand thing I advise it is best to buy in the department store. When a perfume is at a discounted rate by  or % it is probably to good to be true and will be a fake. However with any perfume purchase I do it at a department store.This scent is light yet powerful. One spray on your wrists will excude the smell throughout the day. Perfect for a special night. LOVE LOVE LOVE,Neutral
.As a retired military I avoided odors for years.  In the field a soldier must avoid being easily detected.  Scented body products are common offenders.  Now that I am retired I decided to look for products with an attractive scent.Cuba Variety allowed me to test four scents. On my first test (a spray in the air) I did not like any of them.  They each reminded me of room fresheners  .Then I realized that any cologne will smell differently when it interacts with the human body.  So I tested each (one at a time over four days) and noted my reaction.Both the Blue and the Red smelled to me like a sort of perfume and hence not as masculine as I wish.  The Gold smelled fine but the odor  did not last long and reminded me of after shave.  The Orange lasted longer than the Gold but smelled a bit like flowers.One concern may have effected my results.  I am disabled and not very active.Cuba Varity doesn't work for me but may work better for more active men. Not for me,Neutral
This perfume is awesome!! Everyone asks why I smell so fresh I've actually worn this to the gym and had compliments! It's not too strong but does smell like fresh hung out to dry laundry.  Not flowery or overwhelming by any standard. The price is awesome too. Phenomenal try it you'll love it! Fresh clean scent!,Neutral
I have been using Elizabeth Arden products for years having been turned on to them by my mother.  I am never disappointed!  The product is very subtle with a pleasant scent of green tea.It is an excellent moisturizer and I don't need to wear any perfume when I out this on.My friends lov the smell and the last two bottles I had my friends borrowed from me &lt;vbg>!  ;-)FYI they also have a matching deodorant and it really works well. Love this product,Neutral
I had my heart set on purchasing the White diamond perfume but I read so many bad reviews about how people wasnt get n what they purchased. I recieved this and it smells so good. I spray just a little and it last all day. I will have to purchase a second bottle. The shipment was fast and package very nice. SMELLS GREAT,Neutral
I love the smell and I love getting it for her because the smell makes me reminisce every time. It is a little spicy for me but the smell goes well in to the day without wearing off unlike other perfumes. Great,Neutral
My husband bought this perfume for me many years ago and it is still my favorite.  It has a smell that lights up the room not too harsh or over powering but like a gentle rain that fills the air with a sweet aroma. You don't have to use much just a small amount will last the entire day. I have had many people ask me what perfume I am using because the smell is so pleasant to them. It makes me feel good when I wear it.  It is also affordable and that is a big plus. I recommend this highly. Very very nice. My Favorite,Neutral
I was so let down by the scent!  ITs pungent to say the least but does not make my nose do cart wheels at all.  At first it smells like Tigress perfume (back in the day-remember?) but then it gets weird on me.  Maybe its just my skin but I don't care for this but absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE White Diamonds and Diamonds and Sahphires to piecies!  This one bombed as far as Im concerned with the scent.  I don't care for Diamonds and Emeralds either because of the strong gardina in it.  EWWWWW..........im not a gardina fan in the least. Not for me.,Neutral
Certainly not in the Hugo Boss Armani CK perfume class. I put perfumes in classes based on the scent smell not necessarily the name. This is in the B class. I am not impressed with it. I use light perfumes its decently light but stays till the next day so the staying power is good but it just doesn't have a classy smell. If you like the CKone D&G light Blue you may not like this. Cheap smell,Neutral
Beyond Paradise was my Christmas gift from a dear friend and I was really surprised how well she pinpointed a perfume that is not only totally gorgeous but one that works so well with the chemistry of my skin. The fragrance is a prismatic rainbow of juicy fruits and florals heavily laden with succulent honeysuckle and musky base. I love the lasting power of the fragrant aura that envelops me the second I pray it on and the bottle looks absolutely breathtaking on my dresser. The scent itself is heady and aromatic more floral and sophisticated than most tropical fragrance; I don't smell bananas and coconut here but soft orchid pulpy woods juicy plum and soft dewy honeysuckle with its sparkling golden nectar.This is one of my favorite perfumes now something I reach for very often and something that puts a smile on my face whenever I get a whiff of it. One a rainy and gray monday morning I feel that I can carry a layer of ambrosial paradise that sets on me like a soft cloud of euphoric proportions as it nestles itself into my skin and exudes a shimmery cloud of scent all day long. It's really a rainbow of happiness in a bottle.The top notes are Eden's Mist Blue Hyacinth Orange Flower Templar Jabuticaba Fruit.Middle notes are Laelia Orchid Crepe Jasmin Mahonia Japonica Pink Honeysuckle balanced over a base of Natal Plum Blossoms Ambrette Seed Zebrano Wood Golden Melaleuca Bark for a sweet and fruity concoction.- Kasia S. Succulent hybrid of fruits and florals,Neutral
it doesn't smell bad it's an okay perfume but it's kind of strong... not my favorite. my mom gave me a sample she got from the mall and i tried it but it was just okay... can't say it was great. a teeny bit strong,Neutral
This definitely appears to be a love or hate thing and I love it- lots of tropical floral notes and it lasts for quite a long time. I think this smells much &#;younger&#; than most floral perfumes but it seems I might be in a minority on that one. I love this perfume and it has become a favorite. I love the rainbow-colored bottle. Delightful! One of my favorites,long time
I love this perfume and it came packed with great care. It's a refreshing smell and great for everyday use! Great clean scent.,Neutral
Bought for my husband because he wore it many years ago and it brought back early memories.  The scent is wonderful but it doesn't last but a few minutes. Needs more perfume oil.  Thought this was strongest.  Anyway it smells good while it lasts. Scent Terrific But Fades Quickly,Neutral
This is a rather non-descript but pleasant floral/spice type perfume not bad and here I see it at a significant discount which seems right. Some will like it a few will hate it but it won't rock anyone's world-pardon the expression-if that's what you're looking for. not bad but I did tire quickly of it,Neutral
I am not usually into the floral type fragrances however a co-worker introduced to me Very Irresistible Sensual by Givenchy a few years back and I just loved it.Not only was the bottle a gorgeous pink to purple shade of glass that could be a decorative accent all in itself but it smells just sexy and like walking through a flower garden! This is in my opinion a great spring and summertime scent.  My husband just loved this frangrance on me as well.  I even got a miniature version of the bottle to carry in my purse along with body lotion and body wash one of the nice things about buying the sets!My bottle of Very Irresistible by Givenchy was the  oz. Eau de Toilette spray and it retailed at the time for around $.  You don't need to use much of it at one time and the scent seemed to stay with me for hours unlike some other perfumes I have tried.An uplifting sexy floral scent that stays with you and comes in a gorgeous bottle.  What more can I say!  I do highly recommend this perfume. Sexy Uplifting and Pretty Floral Scent,Neutral
I gave it a  star because although it smelled like the original product it felt watered down. It stays on for hours (probably more than  hours). It's light a little powdery and flowery. Any woman of any ages will enjoy this perfume and I feel like it's easy to wear (everyday for work or in the evening). Just suits pretty much all occasions. Good  but watered down,Neutral
I've been wearing Mitsouko for over  years and never cease to get compliments on its scent.  There are new perfumes coming on the market daily and none have the allure of Mitsouko.  I only wish I could afford to use the perfume in addition to the EDP.  Some reviews say to wear it at night--I say wear it daily as it's a joy. Classic fragrance.,Neutral
Mitsouko has kind of a musky scent to it which I love.  It keeps it scent all day long.  I just love this perfume! Mitsouko by Guerlain,Neutral
Guerlain is undoubtedly one of the greatest perfume houses in the world.  However some EU regs in the 's caused them to change the ingredients and formulations of some of their older perfumes including this one.  This doesn't smell the same as vintage Mitsouko.  I re-sold it. Not as good as in the old days,Neutral
I yearned for such a perfume for a very very loooong time and finally I just said Do it! Just do it! ... and so I purchased my very first bottle of Mitsouko just because I deserved it. The stunning base notes keep re-intoxicating me every time I put it on to refresh. You won't need to refresh actually because this perfume has fabulous longevity and a monster sillage. The dry-down is to die for ... luscious creamy super-satisfying to say the least. Mitsouko is in the Chypre Fruity category with the main accords being earthy warm spicy mossy floral and citrus. It also has a note of a sweet and juicy peach giving it a clearly gourmand nuance. It features bergamot peach jasmine may rose spices (cinnamon) oak moss vetiver and wood. The fragrance is exuberant unusual and elegant not too sweet nor heavy it is well balanced. I adore simply and totally LOVE this juice! If you're looking to start wearing only the best - it never goes wrong to choose from the House of Guerlain and especially the haunting and intoxicating 'Mitsouko.' Timeless Classi,Neutral
This is a really heavy scent though it lasts upwards of - hours. There's a weak after scent that lingers for longer than that though. I'm by no means a scent expert nor was I a young adult in the s when people apparently overdid wearing this but where I'm from people don't normally wear cologne so it's easier to get away with wearing something that likely has obnoxious sensory memories to others.The going price for this is usually much higher so Amazon definitely wins as far as price goes. Some people have had counterfeit issues but the one I got seems to be genuine. I'd recommend this for its price though as with any perfume I'd suggest going to a department store or similar to test it out before purchasing. Nice,Neutral
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for such a quick delivery as it meant a lot to me .. this was a gift for my husband.. and to my surprise it came right after the cake cutting in the evening.. I can't tell you how happy he was from this lil surprise and you made it happen for me..  Thank you Thank You Thank You :) can't thank you enough :) plus this perfume is the best one that he has used till date .. I want to give you  stars for such a amazing service ad the product .. this perfume drives me crazy hehehe and my husband love this perfume too .. EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!,Neutral
I came across this while going through a few reviews on best fragrances for men. Darkar Noir fugured in all but one list.I decided to go ahead and buy a . ounce bottle as the price was irresistible.This is a great everyday perfume with a smell which is very similar to Kenneth Cole Black. Just go easy with the application as its very strong... sprays are good enough to last for - hours... Everyday usage listed in top  in most reviews,Neutral
Perfume arrived very quickly; came with old fashioned atomizer which was a pleasant surprise.  I always get compliments when I wear this perfume from both men and women.  Not too overpowering and not overly sweet/floral; just the right blend that is feminine and flirty. Love this Perfume!,Neutral
I could not believe my eyes when I open that box.I was in shock by the size of this bottle of perfume.I order this for my daughter.And I'm thinking about getting myself a box. Smell Great And The Size Is Huge,Neutral
She has loved it ever since I bought her a . oz for xmas back in ....It was great for the price I purchased this as my first gift to my mother since I got my first job and now  yrs later my mom still likes it. It kind of smells like a little sweet but not that much its not over powering and its ideal for almost any age.....I reccomend this one This has been my mothers favorite perfume since it came out.,favorite perfume
I have always been a fan of Britney but never really been a fan of perfume. Scents that are too strong tend to give me headaches. But this one is amazing. It's light enough that you can spray it on a few times without the scent becoming overwhelming but strong enough so that you can smell it on yourself all day. I also have Fantasy and it has the same light qualities. Both are great scents although I prefer Curious. I think the bottle is tacky but that's okay. Love it and will continue to buy it when I run out. Best perfume ever.,Neutral
I love this perfume one of my all time faves! smells amazing my husband loves it. and of course bottle is adorable. i dont think Britney has ever made a bad perfume though. BEST!,Neutral
This was a gift and was purchased from Perfume World a very good company that packed it well and shipped it fast. Everything was perfect. The perfume itself smells like green apples pears honeysuckle and a tiny touch of smokiness? that comes out after a few minutes. I would disagree that it's only for teenagers. It's an everyday fragrance that smells fresh and fruity without being too sweet. It lasts hours on me and hasn't faded too much. It's really what I wanted DKNY's Be Delicious to smell like but it ended up smelling weird and too sweet on my skin. Overall a winner. I rarely give any fragrance  stars. The only other one I would probably give that high of a rating is Prada Candy which is about  times as expensive. YUMmylicious,Neutral
The bottle is so cute. The fragance is sweet and very feminine. As soon as I opened the box I felt in love with this perfume. I highly recommend it. So far best fragance from Britney together with Midnight Fantasy,Neutral
Im in love again!!! :) hands down this is my fav smell!! I ordered this before as a little happy for my self when feeling down and will buy more!!! This was well packaged and recived earlier than expected.ordered from perfume world here on amazon and i must say they were fast! Will order again from them. . Brintany's Curious perfume.. LOVE!,Neutral
so...I'm really not a big Britney fan. Like at all.That having been said I really like this perfume. It's not too strong but has amazing staying power. To me it smells like a vanilla/amber floral. Very soft and romantic. It's not my most favorite fragrance but definitely a go to when I just want something carefree and fresh. The nice thing about it is that I really think it's timeless. It's sweet and young enough for a teen yet sophisticated and professional enough for an adult. What I mean is it's not a cotton candy and bubblegum little girl's scent...but it's definitely not an old lady perfume either. Pleasant Surprise.,Neutral
I got this perfume in a spray bottle from superwalmart for around $ and it smells pretty decent. I've used this perfume years ago when I was younger and decided to grab a bottle of this one since the smell is pleasant and the price was unbeatable. I use it before going out and after each shower. Keeps me smelling nicely. How long it last? I really don't know. You know how they say that you get use to the smells on yourself but yet others can smell the things on you? Well yeah. Like the scent,Neutral
First of all I love the bottle. On the packaging Britney gets a . I think it's young I think it's fun. I like the color the little heart the little jewelry. It also has a kind of 'I Dream of Jeannie' vibe. They really got who she is. Mmmm I like it it's fresh. You know what? It's a little mouthwashy but it's young and it's fresh. I think this is all purpose. I think it's day and I think it's nice.Now that it's settled on you it smells like an expensive perfume. It's sexy. It's evening. It's glamorous. It's making me want to get close to you! Glamorous!!!,Neutral
A unisex perfume that gets better throughout the day. The longer you wear it the more fragrant it becomes. It takes on the personality of your natural skin fragrance and enhances it. Men find it strong evident and masculine; women are mesmerized by its fluidity and flowery scent. This is worth a try - for experience if nothing else! Forewarning: this scent is not for everyone be sure to sample it before you commit to a full-size bottle. try it before you buy it - you might fall in love with it,Neutral
I have to day that at first I simply did not get it. This was a blind purchase based on the reviews and desire to try something different and not obvious corresponding with my aethetics and tastes. At first I was scared and completely turned off by its initial tire smell. Eventuallythis first kick became the most attractive feature of this classic. Unfortunately this first impression wears off giving way to a more flowery fragrance. I do love it regardless for its originality and complexity. I do believe that it is better suited for women that not just show up but make memorable and lasting impressions (just like the perfume itself). My hysband tried it. The first phase (tire) of the impression was grest on him; the girly conclusion was too feminine for him. I do love it and alternate it with Bandit my other favorite. Recently I have ordered Cabochard (another blind by) - I hope I like it. A Woman's Point of View,Neutral
many perfumes give me a headache this one doesn't.besides that it is a perfect blend between fruity woody and spicy with tendency toward spicy at least on my skin.I wear it day and night thou i tend to take it out more often as winter approaches.as with all perfumes you have to try it on your skin and see (sniff :))for yourself. one of my all time favorites,Neutral
I'm not usually a fan of woodsy fragrances for women but Omia is great! Not too strong and very feminine. Plus the scent stays put for hours which is very rare with perfumes. I highly recommend it! Love this scent!,Neutral
This perfume never goes outta style! I been wearing it for yrs! It is always a huge hit! My favorite always. Love it way too much!,Neutral
Husband loves this and it is much cheaper here than in a perfume store.  It seems to be as strong and long lasting as from the store so I think it is not a knock off. Great scent!,Neutral
After reading the reviews for this EDT spray I thought I would really like it. However not what I was expecting. Exceedingly light fragrance (I couldn't even tell I had anything on right after spraying it). My husband who notices what kind of perfume I wear couldn't smell it either. If you're into a fragrance that's so light you can't even tell you have anything on this is for you! Disappointing. Not what I expected!,Neutral
I love this sweet musky scent. My husband seems to like it as well. This is one of my favorite perfumes. I have been using it during the past year and I am almost out. I will definitely re-order some more at some point. It is ethereal and earthy. Lovely scent,Neutral
And lower priced!I much prefer Realm's original scent for women to their Inner Realm but I get more compliments with Inner Realm. The fragrance notes for this are mandarin water lily sandalwood vanilla and honey.I became intrigued about pheromones when this seemingly gimmicky cologne came out and decided to do some reading on them. It seems that regarding sexual attraction and pheromones they only increase the sexual attractiveness of men. Men are mostly visually stimulated whereas us women are much more complicated(note there is no pharmaceutical Viagra for women). Smell means more to us than men by far when it comes to sexual attractiveness. That aside though pheromones don't increase a womans sexual attractiveness to men it does increase confidence and makes the woman feel more sensual which can result in a woman being more sexually attractive to men.Like I said before I prefer this to Inner Realm. I feel more confident when I wear this and probably a bit more sensual. I give it  stars instead of  because even though it doesn't smell cheap it doesn't have the same umph as say Ralph Lauren or Calvin Klein perfumes which are more evening perfumes.Good purchase. Very nice priceThis is for daytime wear Better Than Marilyn Miglin's Pheromone Cologne,Neutral
It's ok to wear when you don't want to waste your expensive perfume. It's definitely not a summer scent. It smells kind of cheap to me but I have a friend who likes it... meh,Neutral
THis is a very sweet smell kind of like mango and sweet cantalope.  Its very fruity indeed.  It however does not stand the test of time.  Not enough for me anyway.  Im a White Diamonds and Fendi kind of person I want a long life out of my perfume.  THis lasts maybe two hours the most. Lovely scent!,Neutral
I have always liked Youth-Dew particularly the addictive cola-like top notes and the powdery rose dry down but somehow I could never actually wear it on my skin without the skanky animalic notes coming to the fore and ruining everything (it is these notes that cause many to shriek Old lady!!). For years I could only use the perfumed-soap version. Even the bath oil which is subtler and closer to the skin gave me a roaring migraine.Well I have now been converted to the realm of Youth-Dew lovers! I think two things have happened: () Lauder has reformulated the EDP so that it is lighter and brighter less cloying and funky but still very much itself--  a glorious femme-fatale classic. () I have learned how to apply with restraint. I mean half a spray on the nape of my neck to start and maybe half a spray in the cleavage if I want a more full-on dose. Applied correctly Youth-Dew is anything BUT old-lady! It's an intoxicating boozy cognac-smooth love potion of spices and blooming flowers and earthy patchouli and hippie head-shop resins and delicate powdery woods. My signature! And I'm convinced the inspiration for great Oriental scents of newer vintage from Angel to Opium.If you like fruity body sprays and sticky gourmands and hyper-clean soapy florals-- and believe me I like all of the above-- the first whiff of Youth Dew on your skin might shock you a bit. It's heady it's a little dirty and it's not the least bit innocent. But good Lord it's a beauty and just right for me. Give this classic a chance! It's hot stuff!,Neutral
Most Estee Lauder products contain oil and that makes them last so much longer than other perfumes I've purchased.  I can put this on in the morning and still smell it in the afternoon.  I love that about this product. Staying power,Neutral
I am fourteen years old (as I have already stated)And I LOVE this scent! What is this scent exactly?..I mean what are the undertones used in this perfume? Whatever they are they smell amazing. I actually find this better than Amazing Grace by Philosophy. This was a great buy and I am highly addicted to this scent now. But be careful the scent is strongand it lasts VERY LONG so you only have to use between one or two sprays if you prefer. Anyways I would recommend Youth Dew for anyone who wants a perfume that smells good and actually lasts at the same time. :D I'm fourteen and I LOVE this!! :),Neutral
I can't wear this perfume at all - ever never ever ever.  It smells like dog poo on me - literally.  I know this because I actually bought a bottle from the Estee Lauder website last year so I KNOW how bad this perfume can me.  I smelled so bad I could have killed myself.  Showered TWICE and still couldn't get rid of the awful smell.After  hours (LOL!!) it finally went away.  Icky.But before I threw the bottle away I tried to see if any family or friends might want it.  My mother and sister-in-law came by for coffee and I was telling them about my harrowing Youth Dew ordeal :) and they asked to smell it.  Then something completely unexpected happened and it was this it smelled absolutely GORGEOUS on both of them!!  All woods and incense but gorgeously done.  The thing to remember about this perfume is there really is no high top notes.  It's all woods and spice. But anyway none of us could stop smelling their wrists. It was drop dead beautifully done perfume.  Not for kids.  It's mature in the way that Chanel is.  But for an older dignified know who she is *woman* this perfume is just beautiful in it's sexy sort of dignity.Needless to say they fought over who got it and my mother old brute that she is won..I gave a five rating because if it works on you it lives up to it's name of being a perfume masterpiece.  But beware If it does not work on you you will smell like a dog poo masterpiece! LOL ;) Perfect Perfume for the Right Skin Chemistry,Neutral
I've worn Youth Dew for years and have always bought it through Macy's. When I saw that Amazon carried it I was thrilled. Same price but no-cost shipping on Prime and I didn't have to go shopping. (I hate shopping.) So I bought it and got it a couple days later and it just doesn't smell the same as Youth Dew -- believe me I know how Youth Dew's supposed to smell; nor does it last even half as long as the perfume I've been buying from Macy's for years. So I guess it's back to get-in-the-car-drive-to-Macy's-and-buy. Yes I realize there are more important problems in the world. But when you spend $ on a bottle of your favorite perfume you want it to be your favorite perfume. I think this stuff is counterfeit.,favorite perfume
A flight attendant that I worked with wore this scent all the time and I had to have a it immediately. That was in  and I still love this fragrance just as much now. I wear this fragrance all the time but rotate it with Lancome Tresor and in the winter Dior Poison. I also like Jessica McClintock and Britney Spears Curve so if you like any of the fragrances that I referred to you will absolutely LOVE Wings!!!! Wonderful girly perfume!!!,Neutral
This is a very recognizable scent from the mid 's that capitalized on the Giorgio name. And yes this perfume is a more generic cousin of Giorgio cleaner and more office friendly. Supposedly the notes were picked out by a committee. One spray is probably enough and it is perfect for the upcoming late-winter and early spring. Powerful white floral,Neutral
This is my moms favorite and only perfume she wears. It does go on strong. but the scent lasts all day.m Lasts a long time,favorite perfume
I started with Indecenze but of course that has been discontinued.  I dug in my heels a long time but was truly amazed at how much I liked Organza once I tried it - and my husband likes it too which is a plus.  Usually he doesn't like my perfumes!  It is a lovely floral scent with just a touch of underlying warmth.  Definitely a great signature fragrance for just about anyone.  Give it a try - you'll probably like it too! Lovely scent,long time
This is the best perfume ever!  No seriously.  It is all woman.  And it lasts a long time.  This is not a cheap imitation either.  I received the real thing from Amazon.  I have been asked by perfect strangers (including men) what perfume I am wearing all of the time!  It's not a new fragrance but it's a classic. Organz,long time
I ordered a Jean Paul Gaultier from this store and It sent me another version totally diferent to  the version ordered the version sent is a summer version I made a complain to the store and they said me that the product is a new one and it was totally original but the problem is that I ordered that one showed in the picture a Eau De Toilette and they sent me a product that has a lot of water alchool and nothing of perfume. If someone wants to buy from this store think about it first. I don't recomend neither the store nor the product store is the worst,Neutral
I've used many perfumes over many years and I still can't find another to top this one. It has an exotic warm scent not too sweet not too overpowering - just irresistible and inviting.An elegant oriental floral fragrance. The top fragrance notes are anise orange blossom and tangerine. The middle notes are: ginger orchid and ylang-ylang and the base of the fragrance is: vanilla musk and amber.It's in a class by itself. Awesome Exotic in a Class by Itself,Neutral
Nothing great about this scent.  It smells almost cheap.  I was very surprised.  I think with perfumes you get bad batches sometimes.  I've bought Boucheron for  years and every five years it just smelled worse and worse so I think they cheapen them sometimes too.  Who knows but it was not what I expected.  Luckily I got a small amount just to try.  I won't be buying this one.  Too cheap smelling. I thought it would be great was disappointed.,Neutral
This is my wife's favorite perfume and it is one of the few that doesn't bother my nose and drive my sinus's to headache My wife loves this original perfume,favorite perfume
This is my favorite perfume but usually costs much too much for me. It is both sexy and sweet and my husband absolutely loves it. it is wonderful that I can find it cheaper here on Amazon. Wonderful and Sexy,favorite perfume
I love to Spritz this spicy casual heavenly scent for AN ALL day fragrant oriental scent.  This alluring scent lasts for hours making it suitable for me because at times I don't have the time to reapply perfume multiple times.Enjoy the spicy scent that features an exquisite blend of wood vanilla and fresh spicy amber.It is a scent for women of all ages. Alluring Scent,Neutral
I've been using this since the s.. I switch to different perfumes but always come back to this. I love the bottle and the special editions of them as well. This is a new classic like Chanel . My favorite Perfume,favorite perfume
Fake perfume st i received It late also the box was wet so te perfume was liked used or filtered and then just alcohol and water. Fake,Neutral
The first thing which strikes you about the fragrance is the shape of the bottle. Its very sleek and sexy.The perfume is very strong and intense. A single spray is good enough for most people so go easy on it.This is particularly good for evening parties/events... Interesting fragrance little strong but nice,Neutral
I'm so glad I was able to find this perfume online because it was one of my favorites but it's not sold in stores anymore. It smells AMAZING and I never have to worry about someone wearing the same perfume as me. It's size makes it perfect for travel especially if you're flying and only with carry on luggage. It's less than the oz. limit so you don't have to worry about TSA trashing it. Small and Perfect for carry on travel!,Neutral
I like perfumes that smell sweet.. this one smells like you haven't shower for years! ;( the smell is too strong I hate it. If you like smells that are sweet this is NOT for you. Eww!,Neutral
I made a blind purchase on this perfume based off the reviews on various sites including this one. I liked it right off the bat thought it was a very seductive attention grabbing and feminine scent. However occasionally I would feel like it was boring or too musky. Sometimes it smelled cheap although it has good staying power. Since it's the only perfume I have at the moment I wear it everytime I go out and I get a lot of compliments on it. People are always surprised when I tell them its Paris Hilton. It seems as if the more I wear it the more I notice it and I have to say it is growing on me. I think in general I am attracted to sweet floral aquatic and woodsy scents and this definitely hits all of those notes. I would say the appropriate age range for this perfume is probably - definitely night time and not for the office. It's more of a going out clubbing or on a hot date type of scent. The bottle's design does not bother me it's a little cheap but who cares? it grows on you,Neutral
I swallowed my pride and had to order this perfume because of all the ridiculous rave reviews it received.  I can't stand Paris Hilton but the the bottle of perfume was less tan $ so I figured WTH.  I have to say - for someone who is such a train wreck she did a decent job of making perfume (I also ordered the Heiress perfume *blush*).  This perfume is basically a much cheaper version / imitation / knock-off of Ralph Lauren RALPH COOL.  It smells almost exactly like it.  It's VERY sweet fruity slightly floral and on the cooler side - a spring or summer fragrance and something you'd expect to smell on a younger girl (maybe high school college and mid-s) because it reminds me of something super candy/girly/flirtatious.  It's definitely not my cup of tea - I prefer warmer more exotic / spicier fragrances.  But for the brand and for what I paid it was worth the $ + change [I definitely would not have paid than $ for it].  Also the perfume has amazing staying power - it doesn't fade and it actually stays relatively strong throughout the day.  A pleasant surprise for a cheap perfume.  :) Much cheaper version of Ralph Lauren RALPH COOL fragrance,Neutral
It is a perfume normal typical for a modest gift without much fanfare. Any woman would like but not the favorite ever. OK without fanfare.,Neutral
I wanted to like this as much as many of you. Yes I do smell the fruity melon- kind of a sweet honeydew melon? Every single time I have worn this it smells like melon mixed with ACETONE! Like nail polish remover! STRONGLY! I have seen other reviewers mention the chemical-ish smell.. spot on. I just hate it. And I must be one lucky girl cause perfume lasts on me ALL DAY- any kind- without re-applying; I saw many complaints about this not having staying power. Well i wish it wore off me sooner ugh. It came in one of her gift sets of  small mini's. i LOVE heiress can can and siren. Actually bought all of those in larger bottles. Self titled can... rot. Gross. Hello Acetone!,Neutral
I had a sample years back but refused to buy it because of the name. Ladies forget the name. This perfume is sophisticated and sexy! It doesn't smell cheap at all. And the price is reasonable can't beat that! But I recommend buying the perfume + the lotion they compliment each other. Smells great!,Neutral
i Love the smell of this perfume is lajet the nice smell stays on for hrs and great price and size &#; wounderfull,Neutral
This perfume is fabulous and I have used it since the day it came out! I get many compliments and asked a lot what I am wearing! :) it's a fruity clean scent that is soft and sexy.. It's easy on the nose and not overbearing no matter how much you spray on! And is a good perfume for any season and scent stays all day! You must try and the mens version is  star too! :) Love this!,Neutral
I have worn this perfume before. When I received this from amazon I was very pleased with the packaging and the fact that it arrived in a prompt manner. With that being said it does not smell the same as my previous Paris Hilton perfume. Just to let you guys know Paris Hilton perfume does not last very long at all. But this scent from amazon is practically non existent after  minutes. (no exaggeration). It definitely makes me question the authenticity and my loyalty to Amazon.com. Questioning authenticity,Neutral
I am absolutely in love with this fragrance!!! It smells great during fall/spring seasons. This perfume is also long lasting. The only thing I am uncertain of is whether or not this perfume is authentic? Will purchase again. I love it!,Neutral
I have to admit that even though I really love the scent you may not expect the aftermath and inner turmoil that occurs after purchasing a product created and endorsed by such a detestable skank as Paris Hilton.  If you're like me and are thoroughly repulsed by this woman and yet still decide to buy her fragrance you may experience a feeling as if you've just purchased a novel created expressly from trees deforested from the Amazon Rainforest.  Like you've just kicked an orphan stolen its puppy and burnt down the orphanage. Like buying a towel from Walmart to save cents when the mom and pop shop next door is shutting down and their employees of  years are laid off.  While the analogies may not be accurate for the purchase of a simple bottle of perfume I assure you that the feeling that you've ignored your moral compass and abandoned your ethical sensibilities is very real.  What it all boils down to...is that I smell fantastic but I am a terrible person.  Hence it is my belief that only terrible people buy Paris Hiltons perfume.  I am complimented on it daily and tell them it's Dove Body spray instead.  It is my shame. My secret. Don't be like me. You won't smell as good but you'll probably get into heaven.  If you do decide to buy it...might as well do it here on Amazon.  The .oz is offered at a price that INCLUDES shipping what I paid for a  oz bottle in a dept. store. Sacrificed inner moral compass to purchase this,Neutral
This is a nice perfume it does stay on for quite a while but nothing overly special about it it reminds me of other perfumes. nice,Neutral
Say what you want about her lifestyle or her celebrity status Paris Hilton knows a good perfume when she smells it!  When I asked my wife last year what she wanted for Christmas I almost fell out of my chair when she said she wanted Paris Hilton perfume.The scent is light sweet and not overbearing.  I'm no expert on perfumes so I'll just say that it smells like a lady who still remembers what it's like to be a girl.  I realize that that is about as helpful as a paperbag but it's the best way I know to describe the scent.My wife wears this perfume religiously and I'm sure she plans to get another bottle under the tree this year.  I highly recommend Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton.  It smells good! One Of The Few Things About Paris That I Like,Neutral

like always best fast and love it this perfume is very good and the size is perfect for that price great,Neutral
After reading reviews on the various strength perfumes I decided to get the  strength because someone mentioned it has the most vanilla. True it is very vanillic and spicy too with a  hint of woodsiness.It is one of the best perfumes ever but unfortunately it does not last on me at all!Still well worth it for the moments of fast lived heady glory. Rich and sweet,Neutral
TOTALLY WATERD DOWN NOW!!!!  ALL PERFUMES ARE GETTING WATERD DOWN SO BAD THAT ITS NOT WORTH SPENDING YOUR MONEY ANY LONGER ON IT.  I WILL NEVER BUY PERFUME AGAIN.  ITS ALL REALLY REALLY BAD AND NOT JUST ONE BRAND EITHER!!!! WATERED DOWN!!!,Neutral
A woody floral powdery aldehydic wonder of a fragrance. Rochas perfumes always deliver but the sister to Femme and Tocade is such a gorgeous fragrance that it's my favorite of the three - and I love them all! This perfume lasts long and has great sillage. Women love a great fragrance one that others want to wear after they smell it on you. Men love this one too for the woman in their life. Super Beautiful Scent,Neutral
I love the scent of Rochas Man and always buy the large size container (. oz.).  I like to use a lot of it as it is sweet smelling but doesn't last.  I would say it lasts about  hours.  I have bought this product from Amazon as well as a few other places that specialize in perfume.  It is easy to find and I don't think the scent is about to be discontinued (as I read in another review).  It is easily obtainable anywhere as far as I can see.  When I started using this another male friend noticed it and wanted immediately to purchase it for himself.  He promptly did.  I guess eventually everyone I know will be using it.  It is easy to wear and does not sting sensitive skin like your face for after shaving.  I say use a lot of it the more the better.  It's got a perfect smell and a perfect price.  It costs a lot less than some similar products and I think Rochas is better.  I am giving this scent to my brothers for Christmas this year.  I'm sure they will love it too.  The bottle design is a little strange but I don't care what it looks like I care about the smell.  Perfect and I recommend it. Perfect scent for evening ... well anytime actually,sensitive skin
I was wondering how great Mugler's Alien is because reviews contain positive raves. I was torn between this and something completely opposite Narciso Rodriguez's For Her but decided on a fresher younger greener smell (Alien).The first impression of the top note is violet--not flower but what the color violet would smell like. Cool. Purplish. I also smelled big purple grape and envisioned an icy frosted jar of grape flavored Kool-Aid. Supposedly there's also menthol in there.The warm vanilla and woodsy amber smell opens up with a sweet-floral smell for the heart. I know people rave about the jasmine but I didn't really get a strong wiff of it at least on my body chemistry. It fades off with a rich woodsy warmsambac jasmine (it smells waxy like the inside of a Bali temple) -amber glow which lingers as the base note.If you go outside into the cold (NYC wintertime  degrees farenheit the opening note really crisps up and permeates around the wearer-- the scent is noticeable all around you even a dab on the wrist).It's amazing because it starts out a cool young vibrant spring-like scent...very purple or green (without vetiver like in Chanel no. ) but towards the end Mugler's Alien transform into a warm musky scent.For those like me who prefer a perfume's comparison to other similar scents...I was amazed because the first note smelled exactly like Ungaro's Ungaro perfume (the one that came in a flashy box with a lip and the packaging is shaped like a U) except Mugler's Alien has really impressively long staying power whereas Ungaro fades in the first -minutes and doesn't evolve into anything else beyound that sweet cool crisp violet opening.At the very end Alien smells like a muted less waxy (less sambac jasmine and less woods) version of Givenchy's Ange ou Demon. Sweet cool very violet scent,Neutral
Even though I am not a guy I really appreciate the smell of this EDT Spray. It is not light at all but a little heavy and spicy. It is however very manly and probably good for evening wear. I have purchased it for an old friend because he prefers perfumes that are strong and I hope he likes it. Wonderful!,Neutral
I got this based on the reviews and found the price to be reasonable...i am not impressed...it is hard to describe the smell as it has many different notes that are not working together but rather each one takes over individually for a while before it fades awkwardly and you feel like you're wearing a different perfume...it is also overpowering at first...then fades out into something that reminds you of what your grandfather wore...i don't know what others found in it but definitely not for me and you might want to sample it first before you buy Not impressed,Neutral
I use Chanel Allure DKNY Be Delicious Michael Kors Michael regularly and Shi is fast becming my regular scent too. I needed a fragrance that worked well for day wear and would not over-power people around me yet stayed on all day. Shi works perfectly - it's a modern and clean scent - floral with musky undertones very soft and feminine but strong enough to linger all day. Just to give you an idea of similar blue fragrances there is D&G; Light Blue which is great for day wear but a little too light for me and also Davidoff's Cool water which is fresh but a little less floral than Shi. Shi works perfectly for me and I love the composition it has a very calming effect on me.Top Notes- Water Lily Fig Leaves.Middle Notes - Orange Blossom Fragipani.Base Notes - Water Musks Silver BirchThe perfume bottle shaped like a droplet of water balances all aspects of yin very well - metal wood and water in its design. It even has a dark wood base to rest it on. The companion perfume is Hei (the yang elements) which is for men. This perfume is available for a great price here on Amazon it's more expensive everywhere else I've seen it. Soft and feminine fragrance stays on all day.,Neutral
This perfume makes a wonderful gift. It has a delightful scent that isn't over-powering.  And the bottle is very pretty. Shi by Alfred Sung for Women,Neutral
I am a perfume Junkie! I think I use most of my money on perfumes. With that said this is one of my favorite perfumes. Its not overpowering its romantic sweet floral draws people (men) to you! At least that has been my experience. I discovered it in  and almost finished with my th bottle. That is how much I love it! Will continue buying forever! Make him fall in love!,Neutral
My husband likes musky scents and I don't.  I like citrus scents and mild floral scents (estee lauder pleasures cool waters apple dkny hermes tiffany clinique happy).  I was hesitant buying this perfume but since my husband likes musky scent I decided to give it a try.  It has a very light  musky scent that seems to blend nicely  with the floral scents.  It has a very light casual scent which i like. Not too overwhelming.  It's ok ... Something new for me. Something new,Neutral
I love this fragrance this is one of the best scents by Alfred Sung. You can wear this from the morning and it lasts through out the day. I always get complements about this perfumeplus I always have an extra bottle in hand so I will not run out of it. You will definitely love this. Best Alfred Sung Scent,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfumes and I've purchased it twice now. It smells just as nice as the more expensive brands and the price is unbelievable. It has a nice light airy smell- for those of us who don't like heavy fragrances. I will buy it again when I run out. very nice,Neutral
I love body butters because they tend to me a lot more moisturizing than regular lotions which this was. It has a somewhat faint pink sugar smell but it is there. I layer this with the body spray and/or perfume. The size is good however I wouldn't mind it being a little cheaper considering it is just a few dollars off from the cost of the huge bottle of perfume. body mouusse,Neutral
Its not the best moisturizer but the scent is great. I use it when I want a light fragrance but perfume would be too much.  It smells sweet and powdery like cotton candy but with a definate feminine twist. Great scent.,Neutral
I love all of Pink Sugar's products.  I just bought the Body Mousse and am so pleased with it.  It is rich and feels almost buttery.  Its fragrance like the perfume is incredible of course.I like it especially because it is moisturizing without leaving an oily feeling afterwards.  I have bought similar products from other companies and I never like how my skin feels afterwards.  This stuff is great though!  I have never been dissappointed with any Pink Sugar products. Rich!,Neutral
I didn't like this fragrance at all. Based on the the description and name of this perfume I expected it to smell sweet fruity and fun. It was none of those things. In fact my husband thought it smelled like old people and baby powder.Who wants to smell like that? Not What I Expected,Neutral
From reading the reviews I was kind of skeptical if this would be good for me.  Heavy scents are not good on me so I look for the lighter feminine ones that compliment me personally. This one is very feminine light & sweet.  One note is this scent is sweet enough for a younger teenager yet still feminine enough for someone older. To me this scent is flirty feminine soft & a little bit sensual. Great combination for a perfume. wow,little bit
I purchased this fragrance from Sephora's website because I needed something more playful and youthful than my other scents. When it arrived and I sprayed it I was a little disappointed that the perfume smells EXACTLY like the Cotton Candy Fantasy spray that one could purchase at Rite Aid for $. I am aware that this is supposed to smell like the treat; however I thought that Aquolina would personalize this scent a little more. Perhaps a hint of cotton candy surrounded by notes of vanilla would have done the trick. Nonetheless I still enjoy wearing this to casual events as it is appealing. Not the best scent ever; but decent enough to still wear.,Neutral
I love this! Especially the cute packaging. The perfume smells great very cotton candy tangy warm scent with some sandalwood undertones too. Smells like absolute heaven. I loved the smell so much I bought the lotion and body wash as well. Get compliments on the scent daily. Try it! wow,Neutral
This is my all time favorite perfume and Amazon sells it for so cheap!!! At sephora its $ and up. I was excited to see this on here. It smells so yummy. I have a small one for my purse and a large one for at home =] My favorite,favorite perfume
I guess I should never listen to other people when it comes to perfume without smelling it. Sooooooooooooo many beauty gurus on Youtube said how good this smelled. They all said it smelled like a combo of cotton candy & sugar. I wore it once & it was so nauseating & I hated it!!!! No returns on it either. Smell it in the store before you buy it. To me it smells just like Vanilla perfume and I hate the smell of Vanilla perfume but if you like that smell than buy it because you will probably like it. Pink Sugar,Neutral
I'm one of those people that get headaches from strong scents. I had tried so many different perfumes and had come to terms with the fact I was destined to live a life without a signature scent. I'd read a description of Pink Sugar in a magazine and wanted to give it a try. I snagged a sample from the local Sephora. After several days of use I'd discovered I hadn't had a single perfume induced headache. I bought a full size bottle and have been using it ever since. I despise floral fragrances and am so happy to find something that doesn't make me smell like a rosebush. It is sweet smelling but not overpowering. Love it! Love this stuff!,Neutral
I love this perfume!  Every time I wear it I get tons of compliments.  It's for women of all ages I'm . It is the real stuff not watered down so all you need is  sprays and it lasts all day.  It's sweet like vanilla and cotton candy nothing like it. Sweet Deal!,Neutral
If you love the scent of COTTON CANDY you will love this. It really does smell like Pink Sugar with a touch of vanilla.I put on a sample secretly and then walked around the house when company was over just to see what kind of reaction I would get.Two people immediately said What smells like Cotton Candy?People have told me it is a happysweet smell- not gaggy. They said it has a softness to it- not overpowering at all.Then again- watch how you apply this. Overkill of any scent can turn people off.I would give it  stars if the staying power was a bit stronger.You can smell this through out the day it just gets more muted as the day wears on.  This is a terrific perfume for a reasonable price. Not everyone can pay . and up for an ounce. If you like Cotton Candy......,Neutral
That's what people always say when they walk by my desk at work. When I tell them it's my perfume they are in disbelief that perfume could smell deliciously like pastries.  Men and women compliment me all the time and tell me the scent is sweet but mature.  I am on my second bottle of this scent and plan to purchase the entire Pink Sugar collection.  Next on my list is Chocolate Lovers. Whose Eating Cupcakes?,Neutral
I really like this smell!  Before I bought this I didn't usually wear perfume but now I make sure to always spritz some on!!  Smells like an adult version of toasted marshmallows! Nummers!!,Neutral
I bought this as a gift idea for a female friend who thoroughly liked the scent and this was an immediate approval of its rating on amazon as a great scent for women. It is a lightly scented long lasting perfume with a hint of a sweet sugary vanilla mixture and definitely captivated my attention when it was applied (as it lingered in the air)and also later when it also simmered down to its under-lying notes of vanilla.A great buy for any female as a gift idea. Great scent for a woman,Neutral
I'm sixty and I love this fun perfume!  It's sweet and flirty and just makes me feel good when I wear it and I get tons of compliments. Fun,Neutral
This perfume smells amazing as everyone else has said. I get lots of compliments and my husband loves this fragrance. The bottle is beautiful and BIG! you get alot for the price so its def worth it! :) try the butter that goes with it. Greeeat!,Neutral
I love this perfume! It's a warm sugary scent reminiscent of cotton candy and vanilla. I don't think it's for everyone but if you're into that candy shop smell this will fit the bill. Smells delicious,Neutral
LOVE this perfume. I am someone that doesn't like a strong scent. This smells a bit like the old Love Soft with a bit more of a floral/vanilla undertone. If you like bakery smells this is for you. I've actually had it on and people have said do you smell cupcakes? (men LOVE this!) Fresh clean and for old or young. My mom who's in her 's loves the shower gel. Cheers you up! Yummy!!,Neutral
I gave this three stars bec ause I am torn. The bottle has inches of perfume. The first spray smelt like a mixture of alcohol and candy overpowering. it settled and the aroma of the alcohol smell had lessen quite abit. Really sweet perfume almost sickening spray in moderation. Not a grown woman scent but I will use. Will not purchase again. Ok! After wearing for like six hours the scent has settle down enormously and not sickening sweet. It smells like sugar. Still wont purchase again though large bottle so it will be a long time before I finish it. Okay I guess,long time
I love this spray! Doesn't overpower everyone. Can smell it if you are close to me (very close) I love this smell it is a sweet cotton candy vanilla scent. So many people (including strangers) tell me how good I smell when I wear this perfume. I have been told I smell like cookies a Krispy Kreme donut you name it. Both men and women have complemented me on it. And the perfume seriously lasts all day especially if you spray it in your hair. Not overpowering but if you don't like wearing sweet smelling fragrances stay far far away from this product! Love it.,Neutral
I love perfume and this is definitely a favorite.It smells...delicious.  It doesn't smell fake it smells like something you want to EAT.  I suppose that is where the name comes from.  The packaging is pretty and the presentation is really girly in a grown up girl kinda way.It goes on bright and clean with a bit of sparkle to it like sugar cookies with pink sugar!  It's well named!  It stays true but softens down so it is more subtle sunny/oriental/floral.  I've got several compliments on it. Yum,Neutral
When I first heard about Pink Sugar a few years ago I never expected that I would jump on the bandwagon.  I don't like foody scents generally and I couldn't imagine wanting to smell like caramel and cotton candy.  But here I am having just invested in the perfume.  It's not really worth describing the scent- so many people are familiar with it and so many others have done so.  In short it is the cotton-candy/caramel that everyone describes and it has a slightly burnt-sugar scent to it.  Why do I like it?  It's more sweet and sugary than foody.  There's a difference between smelling like sugar and smelling like baked goods and this is definitely a sugar scent.  It's also a happy calming girly scent.  It's very much a pink scent.  After a bit of wear I can almost smell strawberry in it.  It's also extremely reasonably priced for perfume. A Pleasant Surprise,Neutral
I love this perfume. I've used it for a few years and it has a scent that almost everyone likes. It's not overly sweet and lasts most of the day. I get so many compliments when I wear it Many compliments,Neutral
GET MORE COMPLIMETS ON THIS THAN ALL MY OTHER PERFUMES INCLUDING THE VERY EXPENSIVE ONES; WEAR IT ALL THE TIME SWEET AND SEXY,Neutral
This perfume is a fun playful and sexy fragrance.  It priced really reasonable which is unusual for perfumes of this caliber.  The scent feels fresh and young.  The name is definitly fitting.You will smell like cake and sugar!  It stays on for a while.  I love the bottle it comes in too. I have gotten several as gifts for girlfriends and everyone loves it.  It is a fun sweet scent that would be good for daytime but can also feel like a sexier fragrance when worn in the evening. Great Deal,Neutral
Yeah it's kissable on your neck...compliments of my boyfriend....ha-ha-ha!!!He's sold!!Me tooooo!!!I think this perfume smells delicious!!!The scent lingers once you spray last long on the skin. Smells like to me: a bit of burnt sugar--in a good way like caramel a hint of cotton candy and some raspberry scent tones in it. This is the reason why I wanted to try it out so I bought it and I am happy I did.:) Sweet kisses of sugar.....,Neutral
Itsnanclean pure smell. No alcohol smell for me like another buyer spoke about. I love this perfume. The size was large also so it will last a while. Smells heavenly,Neutral
Very good price for this perfume It is alot more in store. It smells very sweet like cotton candy. It is not two strong everyone always complements me that I smell good enough to eat! Lasted the whole day so I know it is the real deal. Smells like candy!,Neutral
i LOVE this perfume. It smells soo good! u get this lasting vanilla smell and it lasts for a very long time. as for those who say its too sweet smelling: ur buying a perfume called pink sugar lol what do you expect? will def. be repurchasing this if i run out! adore!,long time
Rarely if ever do I care much about packaging but Pink Sugar certainly is an exception. The cylender containing the perfume has textured pink stripes on the top and sides-- stripes that are D & you can feel the slight rubberiness touching them. The observant shopper will notice the hot pepper on the cylender label indicating the spicy adult nature of this EDT. The top comes off easily revealing a fragrance bottle wrapped with a piece of white cardboard to keep it safe. The cap of the perfume is frosted pink with fuschia metallic ribbons on the cap and sides of the bottle. The packaging alone will definitely appeal to the kid in you. I will have a hard time throwing it away if I do that at all. The fragrance itself is fantastic starting off with that slightly peppery bergamot note on top of the sweetness then dries to a powdery cotton candy finish after the pepper disappears.  hours after applying it still retains that sweet note-- but not so sweet that it doesn't have an uplifting fresh feel to it. This is different from any other Oriental fragrance I have ever smelled but gorgeous enough that I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves fragrances in that category OR anyone who can't decide between Earl Grey tea and a vanilla cappuccino in the morning. Definitely a fragrance that says that you are old enough to know better but still too young to care (in a good way). When you're old enough to know better but still too young to care,Neutral
this is the best scent EVER. its sweet and heavenly..not heavy at all. it doesnt smell all perfumy more of a sweet clean candy smell..its delicious but mature not kiddie like some cheap walmart perfume. its great. and sexy.....YOUR MAN WILL LOVE IT delicious light scent,Neutral
i love this scent it smells amazing like cotton candy but more sophisticated not like a bubblegum barbie perfume. i got so many compliments from this perfume. men love it like they say men love perfume that smells like you can eat it. that's this to the tee! recommended! sweet like candy to my soul!,Neutral
This is light and yet lasts throughout the day.  I get multiple compliments on this perfume.  I do not like sickening sweet candy like perfumes and I also do not like overly cottony or musky fragrances.  For example: I do not like the origional Burberry or even Burberry Brit but I love this Burberry Brit Sheer!Notes: It opens with fresh notes of green lemon frosted pear and white almond. The heart blooms with white peony. The drydown is gourmand with vanilla amber mahogany and balsamic Tonka bean accords.I was worried about the Amber and Vanilla but they do not over power.  I really get a sense of the freshness of the lemon and icy Pear as well as the almond and white peony.The only other perfume I wear is Beautiful Love to give you an idea of the type of perfume I like. Love this and I don't like too many perfumes,Neutral
I love this scent! It is great for women between their s-s. I wear this as an everyday scent and receive many compliments on it. The scent does not wear off as fast as many other perfumes I wear so I definitely recommend it! Great price for an everyday perfume! Smells great!,Neutral
I absolutely love this perfume. It smells great but the only negative thing that I can say is that it doesn't last as long as I would expect from an EDP. It lasts maybe -hrs at most. Great smell!,Neutral
**I am not insinuating that the one I received direct-from-Amazon is fake but I did notice minute differences compared to the I purchased at Sephora; view my image with notes to compare/contrast**SCENT: I absolutely love this perfume--not overly sweet not overly floral but just enough of both. I would describe this as a woodsy spicy oriental fragrance with undertones reminiscent of vanilla. It is strong but not headache-inducing.To give you an idea of the fragrance here are some of its ingredients:Linalool (spicy/floral)Limonene (citrusy)Cinnamal (cinnamon)Coumarin (sweet/grassy)Citronellol (floral/green)Geraniol (rosey)LONGEVITY: Lasts a good few hours but mellow down to a more warm vanilla-like subtle fragrance.AGE: I wouldn't restrict this to any particular age group. It's not powdery but it's not overwhelmingly sweet. I'm in my early 's but I think it could be equally appropriate on my yo mother. My tween sister I would probably recommend a Juicy fragrance.- - - - - - - - - - - - - COMPARISON BETWEEN SEPHORA AND DIRECT-FROM-AMAZON BOTTLES - - - - - - - - - - -I noticed slight differences which may be due to variations/fluctuations in printing.-First of all my direct-from-Amazon order did NOT include the Burberry sleeve--it just had the cellophane-wrapped bottle.-The glue on my Sephora bottle's cellphane seemed more secure whereas I could easily open the Amazon one.-The printing on the box differs; Sephora's is darker and more crisp Amazon's is slightly lighter and the color bleeds slightly. You'd have to use a macro lens to really view the difference.-The stripes printed on the Amazon bottle aren't as flush as the Sephora bottle's.-The codes printed on the bottom of the bottles differ in size and thickness-The second barcode on the Amazon box is glued on not directly printed on the bottle.I have a pretty bad nose so if there are any variations between the two scents I can't tell them apart. I feel like they smell ever-so-slightly different but not enough that I could outright say one is different from the other. Therefore I'm almost % sure the Amazon perfume is authentic and that packaging differences are due to fluctuations in manufacturing. Purchased directly from Amazon--Review + Comparison,Neutral
I bought my first bottle of Amor Amor at a duty free in Germany on my trip to Europe. I love the scent even more today because it brings back beautiful memories. Amor Amor is a light pleasant scent that stays all day and is not in the least overpowering. It's more of a daytime scent; it's not mysterious but still very sexy.Funnily enough I'd recommend it as a daughter's first perfume kind of gift. Not only is it a great scent and classy it's more grown up than wearing the CVS brand spray that smells powerfully like cotton candy. Not that older women shouldn't wear it. It's been eight or nine years since I bought the scent and although I've branched out I still wear it. Perfect Light Scent,Neutral
Amor Amor is one of those fragances that make you never forget your girlfriend. So guys if you want to give your gf a great perfume give her this one! Great perfume!,Neutral
I don't know how to describe Amor Amor except to say that I &lt; &lt; &lt; this perfume. It is my FAVORITE and I've been wearing it faithfully almost everyday for the last  years or so.  It's a warm sexy fragrance and a bit exotic / spicy but it's definitely wearable during the day.  It's not overpowering.  It has citrus and woody notes; there is an interesting kick to it that in my opinion sets it apart from other warm fragrances.  If this helps at all almost all my female friends my guy friends and my brother LOVE this perfume on me haha.  They are constantly telling me how great I smell whenever they hug me and sometimes my friends sniff my hair and neck because Amor Amor smells so damn good hahaha.  The only drawback to Amor Amor is that it has HORRIBLE staying power; it fades a couple hours into wearing it and I have to constantly reapply.  Other than that I love this perfume and can't imagine not wearing it.  I've tried to look for other perfumes and have tested SO many but I always come back to Amor Amor. Sexy perfume my favorite!!!,Neutral
This is one of my favorite fragrances and it is also one of the most affordable. I really like the smell it is not too heavy but it is not as persistent as other perfumes I own. Really nice!,Neutral
There is nothing out there that smells like this perfume. It is SO very sensual alluring and downright sexy. Has been a favorite of mine for year's and still never gets old. People still ask me what im wearing and the moment I walk into the room with someone they love the way Amor Amor smell's.They should update the bottle or something because it really doesn't do this perfume justice. One of the most sexiest scents made. Very unique!,Neutral
Very nice perfume. Nice smell. I went Kohl's and my daughter spray on my hand I started looking price. finally found reasonable price on Amazon. Purchased  bottles both are good.It's long last at least for -Hours. that's ok on my body.- HP Very nice smell,Neutral
This is a discontinued perfume from CK but still continues to be my favorite for occasions.A hint of sandalwood fragrance along with spicy flavors. Very intense so go easy on how much you apply... mesmerizing....but very strong,Neutral
I love this perfume. It was totally worth the purchase. I got this the other day the shipping was pretty fast. And it was pretty well package. I would totally recommend anyone who wants to get it. LOVE it,Neutral
My mother loves this perfume and she is so happy I bought this for her on mothers day. I'm happy she's happy! My mother is happy!,Neutral
I purchased this item from Amazon in May . Some older reviews complain about receiving an imitation of poor quality but I can attest that I received the real thing. I've used this perfume for years and gotten many compliments for its fresh light aroma. It's a good fragrance to wear to the office. Fresh light and the real deal,Neutral
Several years ago I was given a bottle of Happy and I had received many compliments while wearing it.  When I went to the mall to purchase more they were out of Happy and offered me another perfume.  I was fairly pleased with that perfume and over the past few years I have changed perfume every time I purchased a bottle.  I guess I was looking for a sort of signature fragrance something no one else wore.  Recently I was browsing Amazon and noticed Happy was available on sale and thought maybe I should give it another go despite my desire to find some obscure scent.  There is a reason Happy is so well known it has a pleasing and not-too-strong smell.  The smell lingers on my sweaters and jackets so I do not have to re-apply all the time.  Many people have commented on and complimented me on this fragrance.  So I guess Happy makes me happy. So many compliments!,Neutral
I am not able to pick apart a scent and describe it as an undertone of this and notes of that... what?????  This is a lovely perfume.  It's light and pretty feminine and not at all overpowering.  I get a lot of compliments on it.  It is packaged well is a good sized bottle and I will absolutely buy again. Love Love LOVE it.,Neutral
I have no idea what the heck is in this but its a wonderful scent at first then the dry down bottom notes turn gastly againt the wearer!  My husband even noticed this...........he rarely says anything about what perfume I ware becasue he pretty much loves everything I ware but this wonderful scent has a hidden enemy in it almost like Tom Fords Black Orchid-its a love hate relationship!  Maybe the enemy does not attack all warers but it did me and I never wore this again because of that.  At first this scent is the most gorgous smell ive ever smelled than after that run for cover. Beautiful smell but...................,Neutral
I used to wear this perfume years ago and forget about until I came across it on Amazon and boy am I glad I did. It brought back delicious memories and smells awesome. So awesome in fact on Friday I went to McDonald's after a long day at work ( don't judge me I went to get smoothie lol) and the manager who was helping me with my order said &#;I know that smell it happy by Clinique&#; not only was I impressed that she got it down pack but equally impressed that she could still smell it on me after  hours. She told me she loves it also and she keeps it on hand. The following day I wore it again and walked pass my mom after about  hours of wearing it and she said &#; oooh you smell nice&#; ( my mom is hard to impress) and I told her what I was wearing and promised I would get her a bottle. This stuff is great and will now be back where it always belonged... On my dresser Happy all the time,Neutral
Love this perfume and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store. Well worth it!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this!,Neutral
This is my sister's favorite scent and I try to get it for her as often as I can.  She loves perfumes and has a whole extensive collection and most are very expensive BUT when it comes to this one she just loves the fragrance and suddle floral scent it leaves and it really does smell great.  I recommend Heaven Sent and this seller. Lovely,Neutral
I was so thrilled to find this on here!  I haven't been able to find it in any local stores for years now and I have really missed it.  Sometimes I can find the musk but I don't like it and Heaven Sent is the only perfume that I've ever really liked.  It's so soft and yet you only need a little bit and it will last all day.  And I love the decorative bottle too.   stars!!!! Heaven Sent,little bit
I used this perfume in the mid-s when it first came out. It had a great fragrance and I always got asked (by other women) what do you wear? What is that? I used to say hey get your own scent! Then it vanished. Years later re-surfaced. But something has changed. It is still a nice fragrance but not quite the same. I read reviews by other women who also think the formula was changed. Sad. I don't use this and still have more than half left. If you have never used the original you may like it. The scent is a light floral but to my nose it has more alcohol scent than fragrance. Unlike the original. Not the original version,Neutral
The back of the box says jasmine gardenia and honeysuckle and that is what it smells like to me.  It may sound like something your grandma would wear and she might.  But I fell in love with it at  and it's always been my favorite perfume.  It's intensely floral but clean not heady.  Very feminine and yes men like it. Lovely Floral Fragrance,favorite perfume
My first fave perfume and have been without it too long! What a treat to find it here and for  dollars ! The smell is exactly as I remember soft and feminine. I will use this seller and product again and again! Tatian,Neutral
I love Red Door Revealed but this particular product smelled old. I am very disappointed. I know that there is always a risk in ordering online. I guess I should have purchased it from a local store. :( Perfume smelled old,Neutral
I call this one pink door :). This is a very nice delicate smelling perfume. It's not heavy and musky like the original Red Door. It's not overpowering with musk either. It's become my signature smell. Delicate scent,Neutral
My order just came today and I am really happy with it! The perfume reminds me a lot of the True Love perfume that I have worn off and on for some years.I really like the light floral scent that is not overpowering. So glad I ordered it! What a beautiful scent!,Neutral
Nice perfume for just light everyday wear. Nothing special about this sapphire smell perfume.  The other by Taylor is better. It was okay. Sapphires,Neutral
This cologne apparently likes my chemistry.  Every time I wear it I get compliments.  I've tried much more expensive perfumes but I always come back to this scent.  And for the price why not?  I hope they never discontinue this fragrance. Diamonds and Sapphires,Neutral
The item came in perfect condition and with a nice giveaway(mirror and comb) however i didnt smell the perfume before and i purchased it coz i thought it smelled of a fresh gardenia . Well there is nothing fresh about the perfume it is heavy and you smell old and outdated.. I didnt like it at all .. however fragrance net are great and i will continue to buy from them Great Sales service didnt like the perfume though,Neutral
A friend told me about this fragrance and how hard it has been for her to find. I did a search and told her it is available on Amazon. Meanwhile I bought a bottle of it for myself. I have a huge Gardenia plant and love the flowers so I thought I'd enjoy this. The bottle came today and I love the color and shape of it and the flower lid is so pretty.The scent is very light. It is NOT over powering at all. I do like it. It isn't my favorite perfume but it is very pleasant. Gentle scent,favorite perfume
This perfume is very strong and pungent if that's what you are looking for.  The smell remains very much the same from the time you spray it on and after  minutes or whatever (it doesn't seem to be other top note with this perfume).  When I spray this behind my ears I get a slight headache till it settled a bit.  Now I am using it by spraying behind my knees only.I have been using the Gardenia & Tuberose from Estee Lauder private collection for some years and I constantly been asked &#;what perfume are you using?&#;  So far it remains as my favorite. Very strong!,Neutral
I'd describe this fragrance as evocative of Fracas with a strong hint of Jungle Gardenia.  Gardenia is sometimes too sweet but the green notes in ET's Gardenia keep it from being cloying. This is a great every day perfume perfect for summer.  It seems to last a long time and the price is right too! Not quite pure gardenia but nice,long time
I have to say I have had gardenia's perfume from a different company and I was very upset that it did not smell anything like gardenia the other perfume was from walmart but the brand was not a high quality.Now ready the reviews about this perfume I though ' what the heck' when it arrived I actually tried it on and OH MY GOD!! what a difference!! it smells like GARDENIA AND it last long.....till the next morning. :-)I decided to re-order from the same vender since it arrive perfectly without any damage and it was a brand NEW perfume.I will have  perfume in my purse and  at home :-) I love it...I did how ever gave the other grand to my mom... LOVED the perfume,Neutral
I purchased this as a gift for my mother who loves this scent and I don't blame her it's beautiful and very feminine without being heavy or cloying.We found this scent by accident while doing our every  year search for a new 'signature' fragrance that we each like to use.I found mine and then discovered this for her to try and she loved it.  She's very particular about fragrances and doesn't like anything heavy or too sweet or musky.This is light feminine and when you layer it with body gel and body lotion it makes a statement and not that kind that causes you to wrinkle your nose and wonder who just left the room.I love this scent and if my mother ever find something she likes better I think I'll have to snag a bottle or two for myself for an alternative perfume because it's just that lovely a fragrance. Lovely scent... so hard to find...,Neutral
I can't get enough of this perfume. Every time I go to choose a different scent to wear for the day I end up grabbing this bottle (which is so gorgeous) and enjoying the fragrance all day long. It lasts and comes back so softly and alluringly throughout all my activities. I love this scent! I first tried it as a sample and I was won over. Now I only buy it in the large bottle. It's surely one of my top favorites ever. Classy and Intoxicating,Neutral
Delivery was good. However like many other reviewers on this product I don't think it is the real deal. I have had many bottles of Ellen Tracy perfume from a variety of sources. I have had testers and new bottles and this is not the same fragrance. It lasts about  seconds. Delivery was good. However,Neutral
I love love love this scent! I've bought it before then tried other cheaper brand and can't stay away. Expensive? Yes! Worth it? YES! I'm not even thinking about switching to another perfume this really is the one for me! It seems strong at first but it mellows out in minutes and provides a nice light subtle fragrance that lasts all day without bowling people over. Very classy and feminine without being all floral. Heaven,Neutral
I usually prefer crisp and fresh scents but this one appealed to me because it is very soft and warm--a perfect perfume for winter Warm and comfy,Neutral
I am very careful when I spritz this on me. Usually I just use very little because it promises to be a little bit overbearing if you spritz too much of it. I add it on whenever I use my Flowerbomb Edt spray and I've been told the smell is amazing however I still cannot distinguish which perfume they are talking about since I'm wearing  totally different fragrances :) Somewhere in my mind I can't help but think it's perhaps a unisex perfume. Nice,little bit
Packaging is very simple. I got it when the box was crushed but inside the perfume is not damaged. Taste good I like. The price is a little low is better. nice,Neutral
Introduced in  Hugo Deep Red by Hugo Boss has been called &#;The Little Black Dress&#; of fragrances. &#;Little black dress&#; is an expression used to define an evening or cocktail dress cut simply and often quite short. It is usually seductive. Many women have one in the recesses of their closet. This is the dress that usually hugs curves you never knew you had. One that looks as if it was made for your body and your body only. One that makes you feel sexy the second you put it on. Yep!!! That's what I feel like when I wear Hugo Deep Red. It is most definitely the scent I choose for evening wear...especially special evenings.This rich complex scent has green sensuous elements combined with notes of sandalwood ginger flower blood orange woods and spices into a mature combination that gives it a spicy oriental and very feminine character. Important - it lasts a long time so a little spray goes a long way!I have been wearing this scent for a long time and have been complimented on it. Highly recommended for the woman who loves feeling sensual.JANA. My signature evening perfume...very sexy!,long time
I think this was the third perfume I had ever tried and I've been wearing it since I was .  I've occasionally tried to try out something new but this is the only perfume that I've had people constantly compliment that I smell good. Used since ,Neutral
I first got this perfume when it came out in . It was my HS signature fragrance until Del Pozos Halloween took over.  I am  now and I still had to go back to it. Its a beautiful deep citrus cedar vanilla scent. Its sultry and sexy. I can't wait for the cold weather to come along and I could wear it more. Pretty good price as well. Thanks Amazon. HUGO DEEP RED ..awesome!,Neutral
I got this EDP for my wife. She did not like it like her other perfumes. When I smelled it I agreed with her. so so perfume,Neutral
My friend asked me to buy it online for her it arrived well and she is still loving the smell. But not my style a bit to strong like al of Hugo Boss perfume. Nice smell,Neutral
This is an unusual perfume that isn't worn by everyone and their sister. I hate smelling like everyone else...so boring. This scent reminds me of flowers that were just rained on. It's just a clean fresh sweet smell...that reminds me of spring. It's not overpowering and it's just different enough to be memorable. People always tell me how nice I smell when I wear it and ask what I am wearing. I also think this is one of the prettiest looking perfume bottles in my collection! Compliments Galore,Neutral
I did not purchase this product from the seller but I have been wearing Issey Miyake for almost  years now and every time I wear it someone ends up asking me what I am wearing.  I have had to write the fragrance name down for a man who wanted to buy it for his wife.It's a gorgeous perfume - light enough for every day but easily transitions into a flirty night fragrance.  I haven't had a problem with staying power.  I'll put it on in the morning and it lasts at least  hours (I only apply to my wrists and behind my ears - I know some people do a spritz and walk through the mist but that doesn't allow the perfume to soak into your skin at the warmest points.  Also when you apply the perfume to your wrists don't rub it in - it damages the scent.  Just shake your hands around if you need it to dry quickly)It is somewhat pricey compared to many other department store fragrances but not terrible.  I have to warn you it is a gateway perfume.  Once you wear it you won't be able to go back to cheaper perfumes.  :) Most compliments for any fragrance I wear,Neutral
This was a favorite scent of mine  years ago and still is today.  Even when I am broke I buy the rollerball but think I will manage to break down and buy a big bottle here soon.  In fact it's the ONLY perfume I will buy (as I don't even like perfumes; I prefer body lotions and butters that smell light and fresh.)The scent is definitely light and clean VERY CLASSY.  Just a little story:  three months ago I left my husband after a ten year abusive relationship.  I took my small children and fled to a shelter leaving money and home behind.  It was such a stressful time for me you have no idea.  Anyhow even amidst all that turmoil I found myself stopped dead in my tracks when I walked into the counselor's office and something smelled absolutely delightful.  When she told me it was Issey Miyake I found myself smiling and getting excited.  How could I be so silly and not recognize it??  Especially when I had just bought it the day before I left my husband lol!  Yes L'eau D'issey is a classic fragrance bound to stop anyone at anytime.  Sexy classy to die for...it makes a bold statement without a bold smell. Always have and always will...,Neutral
My best friend had this perfume a while ago as a gift from her mom and when I smelled it I died and went to heaven lmfao. But it was always so expensive and when I went to Macy's (a few days ago) the price for . fl ounces was $.!!! NINETY TWO FRICKEN' DOLLARS!!!??!?! So I was like... mehr! And I looked on here but I was scared to order it because of the negative reviews stating they got knock-offs. But I just did it anyway and I'm glad I did lol. I ordered FROM AMAZON. That doesn't mean just OFF of amazon but FROMMMMM AMAZON. So I'm sure that's why I didn't receive a knock off like other people said they did. I don't usually trust third party sellers or whatever they're called lol. So yeah this perfume smells great like I had just showered but with this magical fresh kick to it that I don't even know how to describe!!! I'm smelling it on my right now! It lasts long and stays strong! (oh yeahhhh I rhymed uh uh uh uhuh) Ok..... ahem..... So yeah I like this perfume... FIN. SMELLS FRIGGIN' FANTASTIC!!! :D,Neutral
Luscious . . . Sensual . . . Refreshing . . . Clean . . . Sexy . . . Irresistable . . . All that can be said for L'eau d'Issey . .And it could be true (I like to think it is). . . or it couldn't be . . .It all depends on the person if you ask me. A sense of smell is unique and different per person. Thus I would recommend giving it at least a sniff of your own before purchasing this . . .Here's some tips involving L'eau d'Issey:)L'eau d'Issey is a soft feminine fragrance that is a blend of fresh water florals  . . .So if you don't like flowery or watery (not in the literal sense of course) then L'eau d'Issey is probably not for you . . .)I would say the scent strength is moderate; in essence it's not too over-powering in that it would drive people away and it's not too subtle that it won't be noticed. I don't know about you but I don't tend to go for the strong or subtle fragrances. . .) I would say this perfume lasts on average  hours . .perfect for a day at work or school or whatever . . .) I would call this a sophisticated scent but I wouldn't go as far as saving it for only special occasions . . .It's definitely for casual use . .Also this scent is probably catering more towards adults than teens so unless your teenage daughter has a more sophisticated nose I wouldn't go buying this for her for her birthday or whatever . . .WARNING: This perfume contains Citronellol which is the main cause for most perfume allergies . . .so if you or your special someone has that allergy I'd avoid this perfume (I'm still on the search for a non-allergenic perfume . . I found a couple before but I forgot what they were . . . .) L'eau d'Issey,Neutral
If you're a fan of other sultry yet floral perfumes out right now (Viva La Juicy Ed Hardy etc.) then you're going to love this one. The scent doesn't overpower it lasts and most everyone you know is going to ask you what you're wearing. While the male version of this scent is best applied to business scenarios the perfume should be an easy scent to apply no matter where you're going or what you're doing. It really is quite a pleasant experience to be close to someone wearing this. The only reason I've given it  stars is because just like most perfumes out which smell this good it's simply too expensive in my opinion; at least at the time of me writing this review. If you can find a price that's slightly more fair then don't hesitate to pick this perfume up. Definitely recommended! Pricey Perfection,Neutral
I have worn those perfume years and it ceases to get compliments from men and women alike. The smell is just divine! It is a great summer fragrance however I wear it all year round and I just cannot get enough of this smell!! Get it you will NOT be disappointed!!P.S. The reviewers on here that rated this product  and  stars problems had to do with buying a fake product from a seller on here. This is NOT Issey's fault this is an Amazon and Seller problem. I suggest going to a department store Sephora or Ulta if you want to be certain you are getting the real thing :-) LOVE  this Perfume!!,Neutral
This is quickly becoming one of my favorites... it has a great smell that is not overpowering...it is a mix of sweet citrus with some spicy masculine notes although i would say it edges toward feminine... this is the kind of perfume that girls would like to smell on you but you will not find impressive yourself... i see it best to wear on a date or at night... it is not something for work... Great Smell a little feminine,Neutral
I got this for my wife and this is one of the best perfumes I have smelled on a lady. Amazing perfume!!,Neutral
Two BIG issues. I have kenzo Flower purchased from a store and bought this since I will be running out soon... this perfume smells nothing like the kenzo I have.. When I looked up how to return it stated that &#;flammable or hazardous material can not be returned&#;!----so I guess I'm out my money....I will be more careful in the future when ordering from Amazon.  It would have been nice if it would have been made clear that perfume can not be returned when ordering.  So be forewarned if purchasing perfume and I'd try another seller for sure! Smells terrible and not returnable!,Neutral
This juice is just eat-up with stank! Where are the flowers?! It smells like a huge pile of baby powder that has been doused with hair spray! I just can't figure out why my nose will not detect any flowers. What's more why is this perfume so dang popular?! Color me confused and befuddled. Kenzo makes some of my favorite perfumes by the way. His other florals like Kenzo de Kenzo (Ca sent Beau) Perfume D'ete and Le Monde Est Beau are just gorgeous. Based on those scents I was expecting the scent of actual flowers not synthetic ones floating in a talcum stew. I'm just surprised that no one else finds this chemical and aldehydic. Confuddled!,Neutral
This is definitely my favorite perfume for about - years already. I keep order this one from Amazon and sometimes I find it cheaper at other online perfume store then I order it from there too. This works very good for me but I guess it depends on the person. My co-worker tried this one because she liked it on me but it didn't work for her. And some of my friends also told me that it doesn't really go well with them like it does on me. I guess  everybody need to find own favorite perfume. This one works for me great in Eau De Parfum Eau De Toilette or whatever. But I don't really like the body lotion though. My favorite,favorite perfume
everyone has a favorite scent and no two people are alike so its essential to try different perfumes until you find the one you love best.  this is mine.  just make sure you are buying REAL tresor.  i learned the hard way that there are fakes out there.  this bottle was not fake but other tresor products in different formats WERE. best scent ever,Neutral
It was many years ago when I first came across this scent. My best friend in high school had a tiny sample bottle on her vanity and I took a spray and loved it. When I grew up and could afford my own perfume I decided to purchase a big bottle of my own. I still love it as much as I did back then. It brings back memories of being in high school and hanging out in my friend's room after school.The scent is a sweet smell and it lingers throughout the day. I love to spritz it on my wrists and neck. One of my absolute favorite scents! Tresor by Lancome,Neutral
This is my every day perfume. I cannot live without it. It's definitely authentic and very nicely priced. Can't go wrong. Unique and light,Neutral
The  smell of flowers and sweet and citrus everywhere I go people ask me what perfume I using! Ive been buying this for  years now Love it smell delicious,Neutral
This was my first designer perfume but I definitely got my money's worth. Have had a lot of compliments wearing it. It's a fresh crisp scent that's almost aquatic - not too floral or musky. Perfect for special occasions or even daily use. Nice clean scent,Neutral
I love this perfume. It is amazing and lasting power is great. It smells so good and fresh- its light but yet strong it has a very unique not so musky of flowery smell - but a fresh smell. I cant say great things about the product of the price itself. My friend used to buy it Nordstrom or Macys for $!!!! And Amazon sells it for less than $!!! You cant beat that. So happy with this purchase. Just like a dream. :),Neutral
My favorite perfume. Light sensual and feminine but not flowery at all. Also uniqueI never met anyone else wearing it.It lasts on my clothes and lingers in my hair for days. Unique and long lasting.,favorite perfume
this is a beautiful citrus smell. i would call it elegantly citrus. reminds me of one of the Victoria Secret bombshell fragrances. i really like this. the perfume was well packaged and protected. and as always received quickly! thanks Amazon! niceeeeeeee,Neutral
Everyone ALWAYS comments on how good I smell and this perfume keeps forever! The quality stays the same year after year. A great product at a great price. You can't go wrong. Timeless and Consistent,great product
I am rating the perfume itself not Amazon.It's perfect that's all there is to it. While it's very hard to agree on scents in general this one is very light airy feminine and addictive. My friend sent me a bottle of it from Europe and I guess she knows me too well. I fell in love with the scent and so did my husband.I have also found this as a gift set at TJ Max two days ago... Very reasonably priced. :) Very feminine and subtle,Neutral
I borrowed (if you can borrow perfume!) this from my mother's vanity and sprayed it on before stepping out to drive to a restaurant for dinner.  Inside the car the smell of tuberoses became overwhelming.  I couldn't smell any top middle or base notes just tube roses.  I had sprayed it on me only twice and honestly I was embarrassed at the restaurant for smelling like the concentrated essence of a flower. Not for meo,Neutral
This is an amazing perfume. Light feminine and smells beautiful. Wish I bought bigger bottle.  oz seems small and for the price I should have just got the larger bottle. This perfume will never get old to me. Love it A must have,Neutral
i like michael kors.  nice scent.  i had an issue with this order bc for some reason it didn't smell right (i have purchased and used this perfume in the past so i know what it smells like).  almost like it had soured.  amazon made good.  no complaints or issues there.  was probably a random weird bottle. haven't had problems since. nice perfume,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume in the whole world!  It is not cheap and I was so happy to find it on amazon a little cheaper then at Sephora.  I am so happy! Excellent!!,favorite perfume
In a perfume world where everything smells like some kind of schlocky hotel soap all of them battling to outdo each other with their power of soapiness this is a treasure.I was in Macy's between floors in the mall moving purposefully from one purchase to another when I caught a whiff of this as I strode through the ladies' makeup department.  It hit me like an olfactory smack in the side of the head and I stopped and spun.  Now I'm no stud and no ladies man but I went right up to the woman showing this to the lady customer and boldly and without the slightest bit of hestiation told both of them that it was the most original and intriguing thing I've just about ever smelled and that I had to hear and smell some more.I couldn't help right then but think of the lessons I'd read about in the amazingThe Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists and whaddaya know my opening had both of them paying attention to me and nothing but me.  But I digress.I took a good long pull of this stuff on a sample wand.  I had the girl put some on my wrist and I checked it out.  At their offer each of them put a bit on on wrists and then necks and I got close-in samples from both wonderfully sensual.  And it was subtly different on both and also magnificent on both.  I told them so and they were flattered as I intended.Not interested at all in the two ladies as nice as they were I had my purchase in hand within ten minutes and couldn't wait to get it home to my sweet lady wife.  Praise Bog in his castle she liked it too and it's just about all she wears.  She and this lustrous scent are inextricably linked in my mind now and it's a perfect match.In this perfume I smell an impossible and unknown range of fruit.  I smell juice and rind zest and core.  I smell the deepest and sweetest tropical flowers I've ever encountered and some that have never existed.  As ridiculous as this is I smell maturity and grace and a distinctly sexy confidence.  I've only ever smelled this scent on another woman one time and although I didn't meet her or even speak to her in the instant it took for me to recognize this scent she had my undivided attention and my respect.Bottom line: This perfume is absolutely magnificent.  It accentuates the divinity of my wife the goddess and then some.  It has a powerful powerful effect on me and I have never grown tired of smelling it.  Ladies: get some for yourself today and transform.  Men: get some for your ladies today and touch the magic. So Deliciously Unique,Neutral
I am familiar with this perfume for a very long time. It is one of my favorites If you like Dior's Fahrenheit for men than you should also like this smell because they have the same roots of smell. It is very sexy very long lasting smell that  you may wear each season of the year.It is my must have perfume for already  years.But be aware you may like or you may hate this smell it can not be. &#;it's OK&#;. I am in love with Michael... The best scent for me!,long time
I purchased this perfume for a very good friend of mine.  She was thrilled with it to say the least.  I love it so much that I bought myself one!  I love the way it gives you a fresh scent.  I give it a thumbs up and so does my friend! Ah the fresh scent of Oscar De La Rent,Neutral
Many prefer a fragrance somewhat lighter than eau de parfum.  For those who do - here's Oscar!There are few who are not familiar with the name Oscar de la Renta.  He is a fashion designer known throughout the world not only for his couture collections but also for his philanthropic endeavors.Since beginning his own company in  de la Renta has impacted the design of accessories jewelry handbags scarves shoes furniture and fragrances.Oscar his initial perfume offering was introduced in  and now is a popular seller throughout the world.  In addition it is the winner of the  Fragrance Foundation Success Award.More importantly to us the scent is unforgettable.  Floral with a hint of Oriental it is a lovely blend of jasmine basil lavender and sandalwood.It's romanticand memorable.  Enjoy. FOR THOSE WHO PREFER AN EDT HERE'S OSCAR!,Neutral
And Ivory soap reminds me of my childhood -- maybe that's why I like it so much.  It may be a bit too strong for some folks but one light spritz isn't overpowering.I first discovered this scent many years ago when I was collecting minis for the bottles.  I used all of the tiny bottle and asked at perfume counters in department stores if they carried it.  No one had heard of it.  Then someone on a message board asked for opinions on scents and I mentioned Pavlova and moaned that I couldn't find it.  I hadn't even thought to search Amazon but someone suggested it and voila!  And the price is reasonable.My other favorite scent is Ysatis but Pavlova works best for daytime. The scent reminds me of Ivory soap,Neutral
This was purchased from amazon and arrived quickly and undamaged.When I sprayed it on paper it went on heavy with a combination sweet floral soapy lilac light cinnamon and musk.On skin it quickly lost all but the sweet floral and musk with a hint of soapiness. After  -  minutes only the floral sweetness remained. After an hour the scent had diminished alot and by  hours it was completely overpowered by the skin.It would have been great if this perfume held up anywhere near as well as the paper strip we tested it on. But it was just disappointing instead. For the price and because of it somewhat small size I would recommend because it can be kept in a purse to re-apply. Even with the loss of initial scents I would have rated it  stars it still had a nice smell bordering on a more mature type of aroma. But it has little staying power. Not bad for the price,Neutral
Romance is a gorgeous floral classy and elegant. Sexy and understated. However I wish I had spritzed one time this morning behind my knee and not twice. Like most real perfume a tad too much can be LOUD at the office. This product is not a body spray which most of us are used to it is the real thing. Enjoy in moderation. nice stuff but beware,Neutral
It is difficult to give an objective review on this because I strongly believe I got a fake perfume from fragrancevilla. It was suppose to me a belated birthday gift which was ruined. I promptly requested a refund from this company. There is absolutely no label on the bottle (which is the case) but the the cap carried no label either). refrain from buying perfumes with no label. they are very easy to imitate. Furthermore the perfume smells quite different from the scents at the department stores.  Smelt like very cheap perfume and had a repulsive scent. I threw it in the garbage to express my disgust at this purchase. Disappointed with purchase from Fragrancevill,Neutral
RL did a great job choosing a name for this perfume because it fits the scent to a T it smells like something lovely and nostalgic. I absolutely LOVE this perfume. It is definitely long-lasting my clothes continue to carry the scent long after I take them off (which is nice because it's such a lovely scent).It is a heavier scent putting too much on can be kind of overwhelming. Compared to something like Daisy by Marc Jacobs (which is an airy light not very long-lasting Spring scent) Romance definitely has more presence. I've received compliments on it from both men and women (I'm in my mid-'s and I think that it's well suited for this age range). Romanti,Neutral
This is a fresh crisp floral with distinct perfumey notes underneath. This is a nice enough scent but it really isn't anything special to me. It's one feminine floral perfume out of many. I don't mind wearing it but it doesn't really do anything for me either. Pleasant but not special. Standard floral perfume,Neutral
When spraying it on it can come off bit strong and my nose would get irritated but it's a sensible perfume I would recommend to anyone. It actually lasts longer and it doesn't smell so cheap either. It smells really pleasant and refreshing. It definitely lives up to its name...Romance. love it...definitely add this to your collection,Neutral
I love Ralph Lauren Romance. I always did. Although this seems like the original (packaging was good perfectly wrapped bottle is correct no leaking etc....) I feel like this perfume smells a little different than what I'm used to. I currently own a rollerball purchased from Sephora and I like the smell better than this one. But don't get me wrong. It smells like Ralph Lauren Romance. It even stays on for  hours or more but it's missing a little something. Maybe the bottle is old. I don't know. I still wear it but I wished it smelled like my rollerball. Not quite like what I'm used to.,Neutral
Amazon.com was the best price I found for this perfume and my daughter-in-law was really happy with this gift. ! Very Good Purchase,Neutral
Ralph Lauren is my favorite brand of perfume! This is my second bottle already and it is a great perfume with a not pricey price! :) My favorite!,Neutral
My Mumzy remembers...when the original Charlie perfume/cologne was created! That was indeed a while ago. Now known as the Charlie Classic...to my Mumzy...this has always been the very best Charlie creation. Needless to say that my Mumzy is somewhat prejudiced...since so many wonderful memories are tied in to this specific scent. Now let us discuss the Charlie White which has a rather steely quality about it. Yet it is pleasant...if that is what one prefers. Although scents are a matter of preference one must state that the Charlie Classic and the Charlie Blue have a rather distinctive and lingering presence about them which the other Charlies do not. One must also remember that a particular scent combined with the wearer's  body chemistry will bring forth a different essence each and every time. Therefore each and every scent will smell different on different individuals. Scents also evoke emotions. Thus such is the mysterious being of scents...and I believed that only pussycats were mysterious. Oh phffft! Oh! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Wherefore Art Though...Charlie?,Neutral
Out of my whole perfume collection and I have many....this is my favorite. This fragrance is super light and smells so lovely. You really have to smell it for yourself. It is what a woman should smell like. Not too strong at all. I have Daisy by Marc Jacobs and I barely wear it anymore (too commercial). Among my favorites are Ralph Lauren Blue and Dolce And Gabbana Light Blue. My favorite new signiture scent. I don't think I will ever switch. I finally found a fragrance I love after years and years of time and money spent searching.. LOVELY IS THE PERFECT NAME...MY FAVORITE!,Neutral
This is one of my absolute favorite perfumes.  I love the sweetness and lightness of it.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  One bottle usually lasts about  months for me. My favorite everyday perfume,Neutral
Ever since a roommate of mine used to wear it all the time and it made everything she touched smell like it I have wanted it. Some ppl dislike perfumes attached to all their belongings and clothes despite washing but I honestly love it. It's hard to find scents that really do it too. This is a powdery flowery almost a light musk in scent. Very refreshing and different from most of the overly sweet pungent odors out so often. Love this scent,Neutral
This perfume is amazing. It has a strong scent but it isn't overwhelming just irresistible.It smells like a trip to a flower prairie on a breezy spring day.It has a sophisticated fruity scent. Fresh but not too sweet.I find it hard to keep my wrist off my nose after applying it. It's just perfect. Irresistible,Neutral
After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for  I thought for sure I'd love it.  I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  I just had to see for myself...Well I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to catch in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess for those of you who like this perfume that's probably a good thing.Anyway I think this perfume is too old lady for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like.For comparisons sake perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious Clinique Happy Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You. Not impressed at all...,Neutral
Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think Carrie on TV's enormously successful Sex and the City. She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker.It's a unique almost indescribable blend of classicism chic and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin Bergamot Lavender and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses.Middles notes are Patchouli tender Paper Whites and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber sensuous cedar and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in and enjoy wearing.The bottle is of course simple and exquisite curved with polished glass ultra feminine.Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion.- Gail Cooke A PERFUME ONE DOESN'T TIRE OF WEARING,Neutral
I am almost  years old and have worn perfume most every single day of my life since rd grade.  In all that time I've developed several favorites but could never find a signature smell.  Ever.  I've tried but I could never tie myself to just one.But today I received my bottle of Lovely.  omg.  I love it.  Immediately I became worried that they will stop making it and feel like I need to order about  of these and just keep them in the refrigerator!!This fragrance is hard to describe but there is something so feminine and wonderful about it.  Makes me want to keep smelling my hand where I sprayed it.While at the mall I tried Modern Muse and to me these smell a lot alike.  Modern Muse cost more than  times what Lovely does so I think I'll stick with Lovely.Sarah Jessica Parker please do not stop making this!! Lovely is a keeper,Neutral
favorite perfume I bought this for all my friends and family for the holidays and everyone was very happy its such a great price! Lovee,favorite perfume
I had high hopes of liking this perfume especially since Oprah raved about it and it is represented by SJP.  If you like a strong flowery smell (old lady) then you'll love this.  Definitely not for me. Not lovely at all!!!,Neutral
I'm not one for buying a perfume pr product just because it's celebrity endorsed but I happened to smell this while out shopping one day and it was absolutely divine. So I bought it and started using it right away... but all too quickly I noticed that usually within an hour or less of putting it on the smell of the perfume was gone... not even a whiff of it could be smelt by someone who hadn't been around me and gotten used to the smell. The perfume evaporates very quickly making it practically useless for any long-term wear. It smells great but if it's gone before anyone really gets the chance to smell it on me why am I even using it? The Smell of the Perfume Goes Away Very Quickly,Neutral
I seldom use perfume and usually stick to the same brand Amarige.  But one day out shopping I tried SJP's Lovely and fell instantly in love with the light flowery fragrance.  It's not overpowering or strong so it wears well at the office. It's just light enough to smell simply lovely.I bought the gift sets for both of my daughters and they too love the fragrance.  One of my daughters has allergies and she said the perfume doesn't affect her allergies at all.  If you're looking for a delicate soft scent then definitely try this awesome perfume.  You'll be back for more! Like Paris in Springtime...,Neutral
But not great either. It has actually grown on me since I first got this perfume. I decided from the get go that I would wear it consistently and give it a fair chance so after about  weeks or so of wear now I am finding that I do like the scent much better than I did at first. I'm not sure why but I find that some days the scent has disappeared after a couple hours and then other days I notice it more often all day long and even into the evening. I haven't gotten on comment on it at all not good or bad so I'm assuming it doesn't stand out too much either way. For the amount and the price I'd say overall it was a good purchase. However I'm not sure I'd buy this one again. Not bad...,Neutral
I regretted buying this cologne before trying it at a store. It's not a very good smelling perfume to me. Sorry Sarah! my nose knows,Neutral
Sarah Jessica Parker did a great job at labeling this perfume it literally smells lovely.  I've been wearing it for a couple of years and it is my go to perfume.  It is a soft pleasant smell and not strong smelling ----and it lasts a long time.  I also like her Covet perfume too.  I really didn't think her perfume would smell as good as it does I figured it was just another celebrity hawking a new product.  I would buy this even if it were not associated with her. Classic scent,long time
The fragrance is really nice and lasts long. It is musky . Maybe its just me but i felt the perfume was more fit for a maore matured woman. I am in my late s and i felt the perfume would suit someone around my mm's age. And she loves me. For mature women,Neutral
I have gotten tons of compliments when I've worn this to work and even over my boyfriends family's house. It's so soft and delicate others have mentioned that it smells unique - and I totally agree. There are tons of perfumes that carry floral notes but none quite like this. It's become one of my favorite perfumes! I've used this for about three months and i'm / through the bottle and wear this at least  times a week. Very soft and feminine,Neutral
This is a very nice classic fresh and floral scent that lasts and lasts. To me there are strong floral notes top and end notes that feel very fresh sophisticated and feminine. Not so overwhelming that it is offensive or too mature but the scent has enough weight to work year round. Normally I am a sweet fruit clean or citrusy person but this is a great floral/clean and if you are looking for a new type of scent to try this is a great one to bridge to. For what it's worth my vanity favorites are currently Juicy Couture Chanel no  Premeire Coco Chanel Miss Dior and J'Adore. This is a great perfume and an excellent value it lasts long like a very high end bottle is also very pretty to look at. Fresh Floral Lingers A Great Value,Neutral
I've loved this perfume for ever!  It's one of my favorite. I always try not to run out before I get another bottle. Love it!,Neutral
I shouldn't have invested in this owing to rave reviews. Buying perfume online without trying it at store didn't work out well for me. It's sitting in my closet will probably donate it. I really wonder why would anyone on this planet like a scent like this? This smells exactly like the hung-over sour breath. If you want it all over your beautiful garment knock yourself out.This perfume can never be in the league of pleasant smelling high end perfumes. Wasted my $ on this crap will invest a bit more and buy one of my favorites: Beautiful by Estee Lauder Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana J'Adore by DIOR. Pungent Smell like Sour Breath,Neutral
It's so rich and soft and sexy and most importantly it's not overpowering. The bottle is very big. It could last me a year or so to be honest. I wanna say that this is one of the few perfumes I love that a celebrity came out with. Most of the times they smell tacky or cheap or smells like there's nothing there.It's a flowery and citrus smell. But it's sweet smelling not tangy. I love lovely. I would not suggest this to any early teens though or children. It's a woman scent. But for crying out I'm  and I love it. So just try it out my opinion could be opposite of what you would think. Very classy,Neutral
Look I cannot complain that the scent is different. I really had preferred the scent to most others I have. That is why I ordered it again. I even have had sarah jessica parkers other scent dawn. BUT this time this perfume's scent does not last. It may last  minutes tops. I do not know if it is the manufacturer nor do I have time to figure it out . I just will not order this product again. scent does not lastunbelievable.,Neutral
Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker features breezy top notes of honeysuckle. And crisp middle notes of sunny tangerine with sweet base notes of juicy mango guava. Lovely is exciting blend with top notes of passion fruit and light middle notes of pink freesia. Leaving you with sweet base notes of blackberry.How can anyone NOT love this perfume is all I'm wondering?!?!?! Whether you enjoy lazy days at the beach or wild nights in the urban jungle you'll love this exciting fragrance.,Neutral
After smelling it my first thought was-I've smelled this before! Since I love perfume and tried quite a few over the years it didn't take me too long to identify it. It smells like a lighter version of Ysatis by Givenchy which I always liked but thought it was too strong. This is much lighter and airier but the scent is still the same. This is a nice scent very sophisticated and for some reason I picture it as being more suitable for mature women rather than young girls. Nice but not for me,Neutral
This perfume smell so good its never lost its smell I use to use this long time ago and yes still smell the same as back in the day no change still smell great thank you and no its not a fake a % real Tommy girl perfume Smell great still love it,long time
great perfume that denotes a male couple in daily use fragrance both day and evening their scent remains long hours keeping the smell. recommended excellent,Neutral
my favorite perfume I love good price! Five Stars,favorite perfume
I have gifted this perfume to my loved ones after reading great reviews. It is a very sophisticated anytime fragrance that can go from day to night seamlessly. Long lasting too Good fragrance,Neutral
It's so hard to find this perfume any more.  I'm glad Amazon carries it because I use this like water!!!  Bulgari Blv has a clean citrus smell.  If you're looking for something light & refreshing try Bulgari Blv!  I love it!! Love the clean citrus smell!,Neutral
I received this gift from a family friend and feel in love with this perfume.  I was wearing Tiffany and still wear and love but when I dont want to wear that one I wear this one.  It is so soft and delicate smelling it smells like baby powder to me. Favorite Perfume Smells Like Baby Powder,Neutral
the scent of the Contradiction for Men - Calvin Klein was pretty beutiful. I like Calvin Klein as a whole and this was my first perfume from this brand.It smells different and pretty nice after a while you spread it. RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE. The price is also pretty cheap for such a nice scent and . oz/ ml. stunning scent,Neutral
A beautiful perfume packaging have not had access acquire lasividade by the name the color of the packaging and the product was recommend to everyone. Casmir hot,Neutral
I ordered Casmir because you just can't find it in department stores anymore.  I've always loved the scent ever since it first came out.  If you like a vanilla type scent like Shalimar (another one of my favorites) you'll really like this perfume. One of my favorites,Neutral
I scrimped and scraped some  years ago to purchase this. Alas it is a fairly ordinary but pleasant long lasting and sweet vanilla-type perfume. Think drugstore vanilla fragrances. I would categorize it as mostly a winter/evening/romantic scent. Enjoyed it but paid too much. I see the price is more in line with reality these days. Enjoy. nice for this price,Neutral
I love the smell of vanilla my house is full of vanilla candles.  I have used the perfume for over  years.  I just ordered my bottle directly from amazon hope it's not a watered down version of it am worried.  Last time I purchased it at a flea market where they sell perfumes over a year ago.  It is not a scent i wear everyday since I am a perfume lover but every single time I do I am asked what am I wearing always get positive compliments. been wearing it for over  years,Neutral
Old time perfume and I love the smell get lots and lots of comments on it and most people have never heard of it!  I m asked quite often about what I'm wearing.  Lovely scent and lasts a long time Lovely,long time
An exotic type scent for women who prefer a richer perfume. It has an oriental spicy woodsy smell.  I am a huge fan of patchouli and find this in like category. Lovely scent,Neutral
I have always loved this scent since I was introduced to it as a young woman.  All of a sudden it was no longer available for sale in the U.S.....needless to say I was devastated!!  Thank goodness for Amazon:)  If you like a sweet smelling perfume try this....you won't be disappointed. Love this scent!!!,Neutral
I am a huge fan of perfume and this is now my favorite.  I also love Chanel No.  Oscar de la Renta original and Narciso Rodriguez but this is now my number one.  Every time I wear it someone compliments me on it.  Two of my friends have now purchased it as a result.  It is light fresh and perfect for day and evening. Fabulous Floral Fragrance,Neutral
I love classic perfumes like Chanel No.  Miss Dior Faberge Tigress Diorissimo and the similar Muguet Des Bois but modern perfumes are just not as subtle nor do they mature in quite the same fascinating way as the old perfumes.This one smells fabulous as it was first sprayed. Then I noted that it became rather pwerful and somewhat unpleasant and reminded me of something I was not able to quite place until a little later. Then Raid came to mind! This perfume has a very strong Raid smell. I wonder what the ingredient in common with that bug destroyer is. I am quite serious. My husband agrees. Maybe if they could alter it and make it smell a little less chemical but rather more natural it would make for a wonderful perfume. Proably above average perfume,Neutral
PURE POISON is a seductive and sensual blend of mandarin citron bergamot (fun fact: bergamot is commonly used in Earl Grey Tea) orange flower lily jasmine and gardenia with hints of sandalwood and amber (which ironically last the longest scent-wise).Here's some tips about PURE POISON:) Three simple words: SMELL BEFORE BUY . . . . It's always good to test out the perfume before you purchase it . . . I'd like to think we all have different fragrance tastes or we'd all be smelling the same . .haha . .) The scent strength is moderate . .Not too subtle and not too overpowering . .jussttt right . .) I'd say the scent life is around  hours (like most decent perfumes) . .which makes it perfect for a day at work or school or whatever . .) I'd recommend this for casual use . . . I'd save something more unique and provocative for your special scent . . .) This is a bit of a sophisticated scent so I wouldn't recommend it for teens . .  especially those who are fresh to the perfume sceneNOTE: I don't know if this fragrance contains citronellol which is the main cause of allergic reactions for those who have perfume allergies . .so I'd check up on this is that concerns you. . . Pick your POISON. . . .,Neutral
Bought this for my mom and she really likes it. The  ounce is very big and you get plenty of product. It smells great on her it's a really light floral/fruity scent that's kind of spicy with a little hint of cinnamon and yes it does smell like sunflowers! The only problem that many EDT perfumes have is that it doesn't last long and I can stop smelling it after an hour oh well. Smells great and that's enough for me and her. Great smell not long lasting.,Neutral
I bought this for a friend who loves the perfume. I have used it before I think it smells great it is one of those perfumes that you don't have to question if people can smell it. I think it is strong but pretty obviously floral smelling. I thought it was a great buy. nice summertime fragrance,Neutral
Lovely classic summery scent. Great price (especially when so many perfumes these days cost over $). Plus it reminds me of my mom. Love it. Lovely Scent,Neutral
This is a beautifully packaged beautifully scented product clean vivid florals with a powdery softness.  Very feminine young but with a vintage flair.  I adore the pretty pink box and the adorable puff.  I bought the Eau Du Perfume too and am very pleased with my purchase.  The gardenia and jasmine come through beautifully on me and this powder is very effective at keeping areas silky and dry (we all have those areas don't we?)It makes me feel like a glamorous old fashioned movie star putting it on after a luxurious bath.  Definitely a scent and product for all ages (I'm only ) Beautiful!,Neutral
Being a musk-lover I was totally excited to smell this perfume after reading all of the positive reviews.I received it today and was most disappointed...it has a sweet light-ish musky smell in it that I like but unfortunately it's positively overwhelmed by a scent that I can only describe as cheap-perfume smell.Now don't mistake me for a perfume snob--I'm anything but and nearly gag every time I walk past a department store fragrance section because they're so strong. But this has a chemical undertone that I wouldn't want people to associate with me. It reminds me of the s...all the perfumes seemed to have it back then. Pretty undertones but smells cheap,Neutral
When the original Night Musk came out backin the eighties I combined it with Bonne Bell Skin Musk Oil and this was my signature scent for years.  I seldom went through a day without a compliment and my husband loved the scent as much as I did.  It was reasonably priced and it smelled different on me than it did on others which I think a good perfume should do. It also lasted a long time on me.Then alas Prince Matchabelli bought the scent and they radically changed the smell of it.  I've never been able to understand why they did that but maybe it was a poor seller.  Coupled with the fact that they soon after purchased Bonne Bell's Skin Musk Oil and modified the smell of that I decided to search for a new fragrance.I have tried all kinds of perfumes in the last twenty years or so.  None of them lasted on me like my old standbys and none smelled as good to me.  And the money I've spent! The last perfume I tried that I thought would become my signature cost $ a bottle and my husband hated it!One evening I was sitting at the computer looking at different perfume sites when I wondered if I might still like Aviance Night Musk despite the change in fragrance and likewise since it had been so long would the change in Sking Musk still be as obvious to me.I came to Amazon and discovered that each was still available and I decided to order them.  When they arrived I was like a little girl I was in such a hurry to try them on.  Guess what?  Although I can detect a slight change in the scent it's not as apparent to me as it was all those years ago.  And best of all the scent lingered for four hours until my husband came home from work.  His first question was Is that your old perfume?Several hundred dollars later and many years wiser I'm back to wearing my signature scent. Occasionally out of nowhere a waft of the Night Musk will come my way and I think what a lovely scent it is.  It just seems to work with my body chemistry especially with the Skin Musk which I put on before I spray on the perfume.  It just smells like me.I am so happy it's still available and I so hope that Amazon will continue to stock it.  During the time I was trying all those other perfumes no one ever commented on them.  Today I went shopping and a lady stopped me to tell me that I smelled so good!  It made my day! Not the Night Musk of old but still works with my body chemistry,long time
I have worn this perfume for years.  It is the only one that every single time I put it on I get a compliment on how nice I smell.  Tried others - - no compliments.  Why change it when it ain't broken.... Worn it for years,Neutral
Ordered this without even knowing what it smells like.  I figured that even if I didn't like it it's rare that I flat-out hate a perfume (although I'm not fond of food-based perfumes) and there wasn't much risk with it being inexpensive.Simply this is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled.  It's strong enough to get your attention but in a classy way.  This smells like something you would wear if you were going to a fancy restaurant.  If I was going to equate it to an outfit I would say it is similar to a woman wearing a shoulder-less red dress that went down just short of the knee with  to  inch slide-on heels wearing the hair up and dangling earrings on the arms of a man wearing a dark suit.Every time I smell it I think how great it is that some purchases sometimes work out so well. writing titles is the hardest part of a review,Neutral
Amazon had a better price for this cologne than several online perfume shops I checked.  Appears to be the genuine article.  I love the scent and my girl is a big fan too.  Very manly and clean. Good quality good price,Neutral
My grandmother used to wear Charlie so I tend to have a bottle on hand for days that she is on my mind & I would like to smell her.  I decided to try the Red out of curiosity & I like it better than the original scent.  It is a bit strong at first but settles into a nice sexy perfume. better than the original,Neutral
Item arrived quickly and undamaged. But although the scent is not too bad it is a very cheap perfume. It has a undertone of like a plastic chemically smell. Probably a drying agent. This gave me a serious headache. headache alert,Neutral
I was so excited to see that I could find this I wore years ago and absolutely loved it then and you cannot find this in the stores great perfume,Neutral
I love this perfume it smells great and lasts a long time and doesn't break the bank.  It smells like it costs a lot more than  bucks.  I like Chanel and Lancme and this is the only &#;cheap&#; perfume that comes close to all the good brands/fragrances. Affordable perfume that smells expensive,long time
I have literally warn this perfume off and on for over a decade. It broke my heart when I couldn't find it in stores any more but after I found it on line I purchased it and I have to say men love this sent. It is warm and feminine with a touch of vanilla. My Love,Neutral
I figured for  bucks how could I go wrong. With all the positive reviews I thought we'd have a winner. I'm not a fan of perfumes but I wanted something light and this is far from it. It's the chance you take when ordering online but good lord. I felt like I was choking. You get what you pay for. The smell is alright in the first few seconds then it begins to fume like oven cleaner. You're better off wearing windex.I'll gift to my teenage sister she doesn't know any better.

I have been using this perfume for so many years; I just love how it smells.I am very happy I found it on Amazon and a very good price too.  Will continue buying for a long time. My Favorite Perfume,favorite perfume
You will love your Angel Spray.....It has a soft and sexy aroma to it. A lot of compliments you will receive.Buy and you will be in for a lot of compliments. Outstanding EDP Perfume,Neutral
I wear perfumes as well as perfume oils. This is the only spray perfume I've ever gotten compliments on... literally. When I wear fragrance oils people comment a lot! The perfumes I wear most these days are Pleasures Chanel Chance Eau Tendre Coach Cloe Body and Angel. So far Angel has been the only one that received the OMG! What are you wearing! People will actually tap me on the should while I'm wearing headphones to ask about my perfume. One lady even walked briskly to catch up with me just to ask what I was wearing.Seriously... going back to my high school days of Cool Water Hugo Boss Pleasures (still) CKOne and whatever else... I never received a single compliment on my scent when wearing regular perfume until I found Angel. Men and women always ask what I'm wearing with perfume oils at least one person... every time without fail. So I always figured I had pretty good taste in fragrances! I could never figure why I never got the same reactions with perfumes. Regardless of what I like I'll assume Angel just works really well with my body chemistry.Granted I've gotten the general You always smell good type comments it's not the same as having people rave about (or drool over) a particular fragrance. While I still don't receive the same number of compliments as when I'm wearing certain perfume oils the enthusiasms seems to be greater on average lol. I absolutely love this fragrance and the positive feedback is just the icing on the cake. Yummy!,Neutral
I've been wearing Angel for  years now. I get so many compliments on it. It works well for day or night. All it takes is one spray on the wrist and then I rub it on my neck and chest. The fragrance lasts all day long. This product is completely authentic not unlike other products you might buy from online discounters. I am very pleased with my amazon purchase and will be purchasing again. The one thing you should be sure to do before purchasing any perfume go to an actual store and try it on first. Apply the perfume to your inner wrist let it sit for at least  minutes and then smell it. Each perfume will work differently with your body chemistry. What smells good in the bottle or on someone else may smell horrible on you. Angel,Neutral
This perfume is amazing but for only $ more you can get the same amount of perfume in a refillable version of the bottle. The shape of the bottle will still be the beautiful star shape like the one pictured above but the silver cap top will be removable. Refills of Angel can then be purchased at a huge discount and come with a little funnel to make pouring the refill in really easy. If you live near somewhere Angel is sold most of the stores have a refill station called the Angel Source and a professional can refill your bottle for you for the same great discount. If for some reason you decide to change fragrances after you finish your bottle you could easily refill with something else.One important note this fragrance is designed to smell different on different people and takes a day or two to 'settle in.' If you don't like the fragrance at first you might want to wear it for a few days to see how it develops. I didn't like Angel when I first smelled it but now it's my favorite. I always get tons of compliments each time I dab it on.Most of the notes in Angel are scents of things edible. This way wearing Angel will remind you and others of pleasant memories of food and the warm feelings food evokes in the emotions. Blended into the scent are top notes of bergamot and jasmine middle notes of red berries dewberry and honey and base notes of patchouli vanilla coumarine chocolate and caramel. It's no wonder that men love to smell this fragrance. When I wear it I find I'm one popular lady! The Refillable Bottle is Better,Neutral

MY FAVORITE PERFUME!!,favorite perfume
I'm really picky about perfumes and there aren't many that I like. Even many of the ones I like on other people don't smell good on me but Angel by Thierry Mugler is one that I absolutely love. Whenever I put it on it just makes me feel good. The description of the fragrance is refreshing oriental and woody with touches of vanilla sandalwood and patchouli. I guess I would agree with that description although it doesn't totally describe it. Do you know how it is when you're just drawn to a certain fragrance and you can't exactly explain why? Whenever I'm wearing it even after several hours I still notice it and love the smell of it in my hair or on my wrist.One thing about this eau de parfum spray is that it is fairly intense. If you spray it on your pulse points you'll still be able to smell it  or  hours later. Sometimes when I don't want it to be too heavy I'll just spray it into the air and walk into the mist.Although I used to change between a few different fragrances since I discovered this one it's the only one I wear. Nothing else seems to come close. The star shaped bottle is really pretty too. The photo here doesn't do it justice. This has been my favorite perfume for over  years,favorite perfume
A few years ago my wife was given a gift of the Angel perfume and she really liked it. Once she realized how much I liked it she continued to branch out to the shower gels and body lotions too. Since they can sometimes be tough to find in the store we are very glad that they are readily available here!Do not know what it is about Thierry Mugler Angel products that makes them so special but man-o-man do I like this fragrance. Guess it is the combination of the citrus and vanilla scents maybe mostly the vanilla that are so darned appealing to me. Actually it is probably the great combination of the fragrance as worn by the woman I love and have been married to for a couple decades now. Awesome.Thierry Mugler products are high quality. A little goes a long way too so you really do get what you pay for.If you are a dude I am telling you now to go ahead and get this as a gift as your lady will like it. Seriously - if you are a lady that likes vanilla scents try this.Go for it. Thierry Mugler Angel EDP perfume - I buy this for my wife - we both love it on her,long way
This is one of my favorite perfumes EVER!  Love love love love love it!  The scent is so fresh and last ALL DAY!!!  It's a bit pricey but worth it...plus the scent conforms to your body chemistry so it makes it unique to you! Best Perfume!,Neutral
this is my wife's favorite perfume and she has people ask her what she's wearing all the time. I've been getting it for her for a while now and have been present when she has been told how nice it smells sniff sniff,favorite perfume
I absolutely love this perfume! It smells great and it tastes sweet. It doesn't last all day but I don't know of any perfume that does. I also purchased the lip glosses and like them alot too. Gimme gimmie gimmie!!!!,Neutral
What a bright fresh happy frag! This was a blind buy for me based on the notes but it has become my go-to every day perfume. It is fruity but also clean smelling; on me the caramel is not apparent. Weirdly enough I feel like this smells a bit like the berry Teen Spirit deodorant I wore in middle school but I love it regardless. Delicious,Neutral
This scent has been my favorite perfume since the day I tried it. The smell is slightly sweet and very feminine. I have never liked musky type perfumes. This scent reminds me of good times summer love and butterflies. If you knew how much of a pessimist I am then you would understand how much that means coming from me. I always keep a bottle on my counter. It also seems to attract a lot of positive attention from people which not a lot of perfumes do because of their overbearing scent. If you get a whiff of this you'll never go without it again. My All Time Favorite,Neutral
I'm so glad I was able to find this perfume online because it was one of my favorites but it's not sold in stores anymore. It smells AMAZING and I never have to work about someone wearing the same perfume as me. I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE  LUXE all the time. Smells Great,Neutral
I seem to remember already reviewing this but I think it was a while back from a different seller. STILL love this fragrance after all these years.I find myself getting bored with perfumes but this one is still my favorite for everyday wear. Completely recommend this! LOVE this fragrance,Neutral
This perfume has a sultry slightly fruity scent.  It's addictive.  I never tried this perfume before and I will be using this as my Spring scent. MMMM delish!,Neutral
Mi perfume lleg&oacute; a Ecuador en buen estado tal cual es el original el olor rico tiene un parecido al Luxe mismo de JLo aunque un poco m&aacute;s suave.. no tengo ninguna queja todo bien. Excelente,Neutral
Amazon seller was awesome it got here quickly & in one piece.  I'm a little disappointed because I like more fruity & sweet smelling perfumes.  It smells a tad cheap on ME.  Definately does not get the what are you wearing you smell so good? that the Britney Spears Fantasy gets me.  It's a beautiful bottle though.  I'll keep it for when I'm not going out.  I usually wear Flower Bomb or Thierry Muglers Angel but with the economy it the sh*tter I had to downsize my perfume & I'm actually impressed with some of the celebrity perfumes that I'd turn my nose up at Once upon a time....... Not sure yet about the smell.,Neutral
I bought this because of the bottle. I collect perfume bottles and this bottle is very unique. To my surprise the perfume is simply wonderful. Will be re-ordering this when I run out. Beautiful bottle,Neutral
Great perfume - fantastic scent!!! Absolutely must buy I will keep buying new bottles of this one of my all time favorites!! Barely found in stores so online is the best way to go. Classic Scent,Neutral
I read the reviews and decided to buy this before smelling it and BIG mistake. Not summery or beaching smell. Smells like a man's cologne. No hint of coconut at all! Don't ever buy perfume from Amazon as well as it is not returnable. Better off buying from frangrancenet.com so you can at least return it and don't buy a perfume before trying it especially this one. Yuck!,Neutral
I am a huge fan of all JLO perfumes. When I first smelled Miami Glow I fell in love with it. I usually only wear it in the summertime so my bottle has lasted several years. To sum up the smell- it is a light 'beachy' smell. Every time I wear it it reminds me of the beach. Love this perfume!,Neutral
First off: Let me say that I'd never purchase a perfume online without first testing it on my skin in a store. Besides not knowing if I like the scent I only purchase perfumes that last a long time on my skin. Secondly I'm not a celebrity type fragrance person. I'm picky about scents not liking the super sweet loud abnoxious scents or the typical skanky smelling ones that smell like sweet foods. I choose a scent based on whether or not it compliments my body chemistry not based on whose name is on the bottle. I was looking for the perfect scent for my beach wedding later this year. I was considering Rue 's  Black due to it's strong coconut base howeverthe scent barely stayed on my skin an hour -something that's important to me in a tropical climate. I didn't want anything too cloying or super fruity. I've also detested any & all of JLo's perfumes that I've ever smelled. I skeptically sampled this one at Perfumania in our local mall at the suggestion of the sales clerk. I was surprised to love it! It's the prefect tropical scent without being coconut-laden or super sweet. It doesn't remind me of suntan lotion.At first whiff I get this essence of golden. A warm sunlight feeling washes over me. I then the more subtle than usual smell of fruits & this sun-baked sand impression. It's musky but not overly. It's the perfect match of cool tropical vibes met with blazing hot sun. I think it would be appropriate to wear day or night casual or formal. Alot of reviewers mention it being discontinued & hard to find. Perfumania carries it discount clothing stores & of course trusty Amazon have it available. Shipping was fast & I'm glad to know with % certainty that this is not a knock off because I've seen some people review beauty products saying they got ripped off. The best way to avoid this is by bring sure you're purchasing through an Amazon seller & not a seller through their online store. Love the fresh burst of fruit this has!,long time
This is a must buy. It smells like summer and happiness. big bottle nice size great price. will buy again. you wont regret it I'm extremely picky with perfumes and this is my # fav My favorite smell,Neutral
I'm so disappointed! this product is an imitation to the real deal. I bought this and another I bought from Amazon are fake! they smell mostly of alcohol. Never me buy any perfume or Cologne so cheap from Amazon. Waste of money. steups!!!! Smh... Imitation!!!,Neutral

Live the smell of this perfume I always get lots of complements when I where it. It's hard to find in the stores and this is a great price and fast shipping. One of My favorite things,Neutral
Although this So De La Renta by Oscar De La Renta has been around for some time I never get tired of the scent. I think it is the absolute best smelling womens perfume on the market. When I found this on Amazon selling for this great price I had to buy it for my wife. I love the way this stuff smells!! I Love the smell oif this perfume,Neutral
I bought this because I received a sample of it with another order. I had never heard of it but found that I kept going back to the sample day after day. It is soft and feminine does not smell old or powdery as some floral perfumes can. A really lovely scent. I've had perfumes that cost four times as much that I had to remember to use or had to be in the mood for this one is light enough to use every day no matter what the season. Great price too. Elegant perfume,Neutral
I got this perfume for my husband and the women's version for myself. I love the smell of the ladies' perfume and got complimented whenever wearing it. I urged husband to use his. When he finally did the first comment he made was: wow! It smells terrific! Good bargain for the size and the smell. smells terrifi,Neutral
This perfume is wonderful.  It smells like a rose it stays with you all day and it's very subtle and light.  I get compliments every time I wear it. Smells - get this - like a rose. Surprise.,Neutral
I first remember using this perfume when I was about yrs old. My mom and I went to J C Penny and I sprayed our jackets down with this rosy perfume. We loved the scent until we got into the car. Oh my did we both get a fragrant headache:)It lingered for MONTHS not weeks or days and it did not die down at all every time we put on those jackets she asked me and I wondered why on earth did I spray them down like that. Those are fond memories and we laugh about it still after all these years.Now that I am older and a little less spray happy (who am I kidding?) I over sprayed it recently and my family was opening the door to air out the room because I love to use this as an air freshener it last like nothing else!I really like the scent. One spray and you have a very comforting rose perfume that lasts all day. Spray  to  sprays in a room for a great garden breeze right inside your home but be warned over  sprays in a room and you will be having to air out your home. rosebushes in every bottle!  rosebushes in every bottle,Neutral
I ordered another parfume/oil that was supposed to smell like roses...it didn't at all.  This actually does smell like roses that sweet/sour smell and it's great.  It doesn't go on too strong and fades nicely throughout the day. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a rose scented perfume. Smells like Roses...actual roses.,Neutral
it smells too strong you just need to put a little and does it is you use it as a normal perfume you'll smell really really bad Its not too bad,Neutral
Tea Rose has been my mother's favorite perfume for more than  years and it has been harder and harder to find in local stores so it was great to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price.This has a distinct rose scent that no other perfume seems to have and it does not fade very quickly.Highly Recommended!CFH My Mother's Favorite - Highly Recommended,favorite perfume
I had been out of my rose perfume for some months now and was looking for a less expensive alternative. After reading several favorable reviews of Tea Rose by Perfumer's Workshop for Women I decided to give it a go. First of all it smells amazing without being overpowering. You definitely smell the tea rose in this perfume. It is light feminine and a little goes a long way. When I spritz some on my neck on my pulse points and in my hair I feel ready to start my day. Feels fresh and the scent lingers for hours. My new favorite perfume....,favorite perfume
I bought this on a whim after purchasing a few other perfumes I had high hopes for.  While this isn't quite the scent I'm looking for it is really nice.  Before I opened the box I could smell roses.  I was excited.  I spritzed a few times around my wrists and in the air.  When I pulled my wrists up to sniff I thought it smelled terrible!  Like a potent fragrant woodsy stench or something.  However when I pulled them away from my face it reverted to the lovely smell of roses.  So for me I can't stand it too close to my face too strong I guess.  But a couple spritz around my torso and it's great.  I smell roses wherever I go. Really nice!,Neutral
If you're looking for unadulterated rose perfume-- here it is! It is unmixed with anything else so might seem somewhat heavy. It reminds me of Turkish or Indian &#;attar&#; though to be truthful it is a combination of rose attar and rose water. Personally I would prefer it in the bottle than on me as it is a bit to intense for my taste. However I would like to have it in my room and sniff it once in a while. Pure rose essence,Neutral
I'm a big fan of the scent of roses and was looking for a signature perfume. This smells really pretty - almost exactly like a tea rose which were in my garden growing up. You can't beat the price for the amount of perfume you get. Just watch out how much you spray. It smells so good it's easy to overdo it... but you don't need much. Smells great!,Neutral
I love tea rose rose is one of my favorite fragrances.  I have a VERY sensitive nose and use mostly essential oils and those are almost like the &#;real thing&#;... I read the reviews before purchasing this and thought I'd give it a try.  I&#;ve been very excited to get it and it came today and it smells very much like tea rose.  A bit potent and &#;like eu de perfume&#; but as close to the great scents of the oils as a spray in a bottle can get I imagine!!  It is a great gift... I'm glad it's potent so a little goes a long way and it will last hours and hours...  I absolutely am very pleased!! smells wonderful!!!,Neutral
I've been looking for some kind of rose body spray perfume etc. I'm in my mid-'s but just love the scent of roses. However it's extremely hard to find anything. I bought the Tea Rose and didn't have very high hopes as I'd been through a couple sprays before...but I was very pleasantly surprised. It lasts through most of my day doesn't take a whole lot of sprays and yet isn't overpowering. It's also a very true-rose smell. It's not something artificial or mixed with a musky odor or something. I really do love this stuff! Just what I've been looking for,Neutral
For years I had been looking for a rose-scented perfume that simply smelled like roses. No added scents such as peach grapefruit blackberry musk or whatever undertones midtones just simple roses. One day I walked into a discount perfume store in Georgia and I told the salesperson what I wanted and he handed me Tea Rose. I have not used any other perfume since and I stock up whenever possible. I always get compliments about this perfume and I hope that it will continued to be manufactured for years to come. Thank you Amazon for making it available at such an affordable price. I will buy this perfume for as long as it available.,Neutral
If your looking for a true rose scented perfume look no more. I love this perfume smells like fresh roses in a bottle! When you st spray it it is kind of overwhelming but it quickly dies down to a lovely soft scent. After a while I can't smell it anymore but if I put on my jacket from the day before I get a whiff of roses so I guess my nose just gets use to it lol this scent is good for layering with other perfumes too. Love it. love this scent!,Neutral
A good perfume smell so good  last a long time do i wash my dishes and  in a hour i still smell it on my arm so you know thats a good one Smell so good a great bye,long time
My first impressions about the perfume is that It smells absolutely fantastic and the bottle has a gorgeous look that adds charm to it. Package delivered on time. Thanks. I am in love,Neutral
I really love this pedi  for gifts and get well looked fast and I love I will continue buying perfumer for men,Neutral
Powerful projection. Old school scent that lasts the whole day. the whole whole day. Only for the brave. If you like subtlety this is not your perfume. It announces your presence. Powerful,Neutral
I have an extensive collection of fragrances totalling almost  and recently I ran out of Carolina Herrera Aqua (which is really a masculine floral scent not an aquatic).  Not wanting to pay - bucks for a .oz. replacement bottle domestically I began looking in stores for a similar item to add to my collection.  I had sampled Subtil in a mall perfume shop and liked it but they only had the . oz for about  bucks so I passed.  Recently I got lucky and found the . at a discounter for $ so I picked it up and have been very pleased.  This scent runs along the same lines as the Herrera Aqua and the ladies love it.  Not sure why it gets blasted in reviews for poor lasting power because I have found the scent to last at least  hours although like most others it becomes more of a skin scent after a few hours.  I find the drydown to be the best part... it has a floral/light musk/light patchouli/very sophisticated tone and I think its great! Flies under the radar,Neutral
I was happy to find Cabochard by Gr&egrave;s on Amazon as it was my signature perfume many years ago.  The bottle now looks completely different than the old one which had a beautiful and original design.  The fragrance is also slightly different than the original but still very nice.  It is not a 'fresh' scent but rather a complex sophisticated spicy fragrance as were the perfumes of the s and s that I find more suitable for a mature woman than a young girl It is a sexy and elegant scent which I am happy to return to.  A little goes a long way... A little different,long way
I recently came across information on Madam Gres's timeless designs and as a sidetrack read about the designer's perfumes. I am fully aware that re-formulations are sometimes hard to deal with especially if there is a strong attachment with the original formulations. For example I still cannot come to terms with the rewamping of Rive Gauche. A significant part of my life is associated with its unmistakeable signature fragrance. In a reformulated format it felt like it was a disinherited cousin to a wealthy aristocratic original. Eventually I embraced its simplified persona and included it into my perfume pallette. In case of Cabochard  have never tried the original.  I read the reviews both positive and negative and decided to give it a try. After I had made a purchase I came across a particularly bitter review by Luca Turin one of the estimed experts on the subject of parfumery. He compared re-formulated Cabochard to withered and prematurely aged Peter O'Tool nothing like the original Laurence of Arabil god so to speak. I was horrified. Well I was not so much concerned with the loss of money (thankfully it is very affordable) but by the fact that I was tricked into buying it. When I received it I was pleasantly surprised. It is a memorable perfume - no flowerly simplicity here. It would be well suited for a woman who wants to make a statement and knows what she wants. I might still hunt it down on ebay one of these days but I am perfectly content with this imposter. I do love Bandit and Azuree but Cabochard will take its proper place in my collection of perfumes to reflect my executive power and confidence moods and roles I need to play in life. Unjustly Accused!,Neutral
Both my wife and my daughter loves the smell of Aquolina Pink Sugar Perfume. During the Xmas season it was selling for just under a hundred dollars for this size. Then after Xmas I found it on Amazon for a fraction of the msrp and bought two of the large .os bottles for my wife and daughter. They were completely happy with this after Xmas present. Very Satisfied,Neutral
I love the smell not to strong.. It just reminds me of cake or candy.. Very nice not over powering I'd say it's in between a body spray and perfume meaning the strength of it. I even bought the hair perfume which is nice too it's not over powering it's a very light scent great for people who may wash hair not everyday like me gives your hair the smell of like you just washed it. I used to use Pantene I can't find it anymore I would just pump a little bit in my hand and run my fingers through my hair it had alcohol in it so it absorbed quickly so no oil..but it smelled soooo good!! I think it was a type of maybe dry shampoo? I can't even remember it's been so long... But I love this Pink Sugar!!! I got it at Ulta.com for $ I think it's normally $. The pink sugar hair perfume is $ not a big bottle but lasts a long time! It won't make your hair stiff or anything you just spray a little on after you have put your hair spray on or say if your going out later at night it refreshes your hair like you just washed it.. Definitely worth trying out. :) Smells like cake!!,little bit
This is my daily/work perfume.  I LOVE IT!  I get compliments all the time.  I smell like CAKE.  Cake people!  What's better than smelling like cake all day?  NOTHING.  I use their partner perfume PS Sensual layered over it for a quick after work date scent refresher and they complement each other well. !!!!!!!!!,Neutral
Do you like sugary smells? Do you prefer vanillas over florals? Do you enjoy smelling like a warm delicious pastry? Then hands down you should love this perfume. Now that I've finally discovered it I feel like I have joined this secret club of women I've envied for years who always smell so notably sweet instead of the nauseating musk I smell in so many others perfumes. Finally I smell like a walking sugar cube too - and I love it!!! Like Sweets? Buy This!,Neutral
This perfume isn't for people who don't like a strong sweet smell...but I personally am not afraid to smell wonderful all day long. A sweet vanilla and brown sugar smell is what this perfume delivers. I've had both males and females tell me that I smell &#;delicious!&#;. Won't ever leave home without smelling awesome! I keep one in my purse one in my bathroom for getting dressed and another one in my car...just in case I'm in a hurry and forget. :)(Mine! Mine! Mine! - Finding Nemo) My signature scent :),Neutral
Dont like the stages . When I put this perfume it smells strong licorice . If I use to much makes me sick so I have to go easy with this. Then after the licorice you can tell each smell . But at the end YEEEES that was the smell I was waiting for. Very yummy! This can be the first thing you do when toy are planning to go out after you shower. By the time you are done doing your makeup hair dressing.... You will be smelling so yummy  and sweet. Another way to do  it is spraying tie clothes the night before. It will have a soft sweet smell that I can't resist. But now that I tried the original and the sensual... I prefer the sensual more of a grown up smell. Even though you are add old as you feel. The sensual I doesn't go threw all these different stages that you have to wait for the final result of this yummy scent. Good price the smell stays for long time. Dont like the stages,long time
I saw someone review this perfume on youtube and I was so curious I had to purchase it. A . oz of this bottle on Sephora.com is $ dollars so I jumped on it when I saw it on amazon. I was a little skeptical at how cheap the price was compared to Sephora but considering the reviews I thought I'd give it a go. It does smell like warmth cookies cotton candy and any baked sweet thing you can think of.. However I've noticed that the brand Aquolina is nowhere to be found on this perfume not on the packaging or anywhere else and that was a little odd to me. Since I've never purchased this at a store I don't really have anything to compare it to. I checked out sephora's site and I looked up this perfume and I noticed that right above the Pink Sugar logo Aquolina's brand name is above it but it isn't on the one I just received from amazon. Idk.. It still smells great but I just wonder if I'm missing out on what IT ACTUALLY smells like if this one isn't by Aquolina..??? Has anyone else bought this at an actual store without the brand name anywhere on it? Just curious. Smells great but....,Neutral
I liked this product - delivery was on time and the scent was light and pleasant. What really sold me was when out of the blue my Husband said he loved that scent I had on. That's what I like to hear. Nice perfume,Neutral
This is my all time favorite perfume! I love that Amazon sells it so cheaply. I almost didn't want to say how much I love it for fear of demand going up and prices being jacked... but I just love it! My favorite!!!,favorite perfume
This perfume is % FAKE!! Pay a little more for the real perfume at Sephora this FAKE perfume smells terrible & nothing like the real one. Don't make the same mistake I made by purchasing this. Save your money & for $ more you can purchase the real perfume. FAKE FAKE FAKE!!! DO NOT BUY,Neutral
I absolutely LOVE this perfume and will not be needing to look for a new one any time soon. Every time I have ordered it from Amazon it has come within the specified time frame and I have never had any problems. My boyfriend loves this scent and always comments on how nice it smells. The Best Perfume Around!,Neutral
This shampoo has a nice texture it's kind of like a lotion with a little gel mixed in. It produces a nice rich lather and left my hair feeling squeeky clean without feeling like it completely stripped it of all it's oils. It seems to be good for color treated hair which can tend to be a little dry.  I usedDove Color Care Conditioner . Ounceas a conditioner.  My hair has a lot of shine and feels soft after using it. Some of that is probably due to the conditioner but I can't really use just a shampoo since I have very fine hair and it would end up very tangled after washing if I didn't use a conditioner.The price of this product is very reasonable and it does everything a good shampoo should do. It produces a good lather gets my hair clean and isn't too harsh. I learned a long time ago that it isn't necessary to spend a gazillion dollars on shampoos and conditioners with fancy salon names and packaging when the results were identical if not better with many of the supermarket brands. And I love the scent of Dove products. This has a light floral fragrance just enough to make you feel good while shampooing but not enough to conflict with your regular perfumes or body care products. A good shampoo at a reasonable price,long time
I shower and wash my hair every day. I also like to put my hair through more abuse by styling and coloring it. I recently had an ombr&eacute; job done so I was happy that I was able to receive this through the vine.Starting out I only used a small bit dime sized really which turned out to be enough for my medium length hair. It lathered up very well although the smell was off-putting. It smelled like hair dye but none of my color was rinsing out. The smell continued until I styled my hair later on. However it didn't interfere with my perfume so I'm quite happy with it.After a couple of uses while my fly-aways have neither increased nor decreased my hair color has stayed as vibrant as when I came out of the salon. My hair looks and feels soft as well. (I also used the accompanying conditioner)The bottle itself is clean looking (yes aesthetics in the shower) easy to grab with soapy hands and dispensing isn't any better or worse than any other shampoo I've tried. I definitely plan on buying more of this. Gorgeous Hair,Neutral
I use Dove products regularly and have had very good results overall.  This shampoo helps my highlights get some shine and life even after a while of having them done.  My hair is on the fine side and can get too dry with highlights this shampoo brings back some of the moisture making my hair look healthy.  I can't use it by itself I must use conditioner with it my hair tangles easily if I don't.  It has a nice scent that doesn't overpower any other perfume I use.  I will keep using this shampoo. Nice moisture use with conditioner,Neutral
This paraffin is just awesome. The smell all around the house  amazing. And these pearls melts rather quickly very very nice.I just love it it leaves my feet so soft and with perfume besides the healthy side of it. That is the reason why I use lots of this for my arthritis but this one really makes the house full of lavender and my feet are so soft. Unbelievable . My husband is jealous now he can't believe how soft my fee are. Really very nice product  it is worth the money Amazing worth the money you pay,Neutral
This is fair but not one of my favorites. The only reason I have this is because my neice gave it to me as a birthday present. I guess the quality of this reflects on the price. I am so much into my designer perfumes that compared with them this is quite putrid. I guess this would be great for teenagers but sadly not for me. It was fair at best. Ok,Neutral
This is an unforgettable fragrance - one of Dior's best ( ADDICT is another standout ) and well worth the hefty price . Why ? It is :feminine RICH not overpowering  and sensual - VERY sensual . In spite of its sultry sexiness the fragrance is very classy and sophisticated . The fragrance wears well and is very long lasting . I believe it is one of the best perfumes EVER formulated . Best word to to describe it : intoxicating . SEXY SEXY SEXY,Neutral
This perfume has an amazing unique scent.  It is a very sweet and sensual smell.  I would describe it as a sweet almond or amaretto scent.  If you like food scents you will like it.  But it's got a little something extra to make it smell sexier too.  It lasts all day.  If you get a little bit onto your sleeve it will be a lovely scent that lasts until you wash it.  I always get a ton of compliments on this scent. Sweet almond scent,little bit
I recently purchased this perfume for a friend.  When I sampled it in the store I thought that Pink Sugar had a sweet girly scent somewhat reminiscent of cotton candy and it seemed like a perfect match for my pink-loving friend.  Throughout the day however I continued to notice the fragrance which I had sampled on my own wrist.  Over time the sweet component of the scent faded somewhat leaving behind warmer fuller notes that had both a vanilla and a musky quality.  Although I'm not usually a fan of overly sweet scents this dry-down was extremely appealing and in the end I felt that this was a fragrance I would wear myself.Still I do think the appeal of this perfume is limited to those who prefer scents that are a bit more on the girly or feminine side.  However if you have dismissed Pink Sugar as being too sweet for you you might want to give it a try and see if you like the way this fragrance transforms over time. A sweet girly scent with surprising sophistication,Neutral
This is another perfume i bought without knowing how it smell and i LOVE IT OMG it smells so good and fruity and last a long time i will be getting another bottle. Yummy,long time
I have heard so many good things about this perfume. So I bought it without smelling it first. Ugh. It gives me a migraine. It doesn't smell like cotton candy and sweet stuff. Oh no. It smells like black licorice and musk. I don't see what the hype is. Just nasty. Headache inducing...,Neutral
The best perfume scent that has been my wife. It is the most sensual I've tried and she loves it. Very good. Very good.,Neutral
I bought this perfume as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it so much! i do ADORE IT too. he is very allergic and this fragrance suits him cause it is not too strong and i absolutely love when he wears it! Mont Blanc lover!,Neutral
Got Prada L'Eau Ambree as a present for Christmas a few years ago and fell in love with the light scent.  Seems to sell out quickly and I hate to run around to find it so tried looking at amazon...So glad they have it and will buy more in the future.  Get compliments on the aroma a lot!!!! Best perfume ever,Neutral
Within  days of starting to use this lotion on my upper body I see a drastic reduction of the little red bumps that have plagued the backs of my upper arms for + years. Overall my skin is softer and smoother to the touch and appears more youthful.  I think I still need something even strong for the backs of my hands but over all I am extremely happy with the product.It does sting a little when it first goes on after a shower but so worth it.  There isn't really any fragrance so it doesn't compete with my perfume and it absorbs quickly enough that I can apply it put on my makeup in the morning and then get dressed without feeling like it's rubbing off on my clothes.I'm so impressed I started using it on my feet/legs this week....sandal weather is almost here! So happy!,Neutral
This mud mask is gentle cleans pores reduce blemishes and dries in a reasonable  minutes (whereas some masks take up to - minutes.)  I have sensitive combination-type skin and saw immediate benefit from using this product.  However it is heavily perfumed and those who are sensitive to flowery smells will not be able to use it. Works well but too perfumey,Neutral
I've been buying Endless Summer for several years; very easy to use at a good price. The lotion glides on smoothly absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling doesn't streak or leave dark pigment on the backs of knees like some tanners and has low perfume.It gradually builds natural-looking color at whatever level I choose. It also blends nicely with non-treated areas so it's great for adding a touch of color to legs arms and shoulders without lines of demarcation. I leave my face and neck porcelain and this gives me the perfect hint of tan near my neck and face without contrasting strangely with my pale complexion. Easiest self-tanner and no streaks,Neutral
This is the first sunblock I've tried in  years that didn't make my eyes water from the chemical scent or perfumes; nor does it sting even when placed on the eyelids.It does take some serious rubbing to work it all in but it almost entirely soaks in after a few minutes and leaves your skin smooth and not at all grimy feeling like most blocks.  I can put it under makeup and not have an oil slick or gross makeup creases.  There is only the very faintest smell (like a tiny hint of orange rind?) but it's got less smell than my unscented lotions do.  It keeps my paperwhite skin from burning and I usually have to use a level + block in the chemical variety to get the same level of protection (this is rated at  SPF). Finally! No scent no sting and no burns!,Neutral
Smells like artificial strawberry plastic. It is fine under perfume but I wouldn't wear it alone or I would smell like a strawberry shortcake doll. The moisturizing properties of the body butter are nice. Plastic artificial strawberry,Neutral
This is a great moisturizer - I like that I can use a light option or a thicker version of the body butter depending on the dryness of my skin.The reason I gave it  stars is the scent. As far as I know macademia nuts don't smell like anything.. and if they do there's nothing 'nutty' about the smell of this lotion. It's very strong and perfumey and while it didn't bother me at first it started to after my roommate told me it smelled like pizza. To me it doesn't at ALL but it's still a very heavy and long lasting scent so I definitely recommend smelling it in-store before you buy it. Macademia Dual Body Butter,Neutral
The Body Shop describes Sweet Lemon as a uplifting citrus scent. Well I don't think that's entirely accurate. My husband actually doesn't like the scent of lemons by themselves. Both he and my older son thought this had a more floral scent. The lemon itself seems to be more in the background. I used to have a lemon tree and it reminds me of the scent of lemon blossoms.The reason I keep returning to Body Shop body butters is that they work better than any other body moisturizing product I have ever used. I live in a very dry climate and my skin really needs some heavy duty moisture and Sweet Lemon Body Butter provides it. Word of warning: use less than you think you need! Once applied to your skin it warms up and spreads easily but you might notice that it takes a bit more effort for the body butter to fully integrate with the skin. When first applied my skin can seem a bit sticky so that's why I give myself a good ten minutes before hopping into bed or putting on my clothes. However once it is fully absorbed the results are fantastic. My skin is super soft and my dry patches (especially on my elbows and feet) look better and actually start to heal. If I go a few days without using it I notice that my skin looks dry and starts to feel itchy again. I also like the nice sheen that it imparts on my skin.Another reason I love to use Sweet Lemon is it a nice fragrance and I can forgo perfume. The scent sticks around for a couple hours which is roughly the same as a bottled fragrance. Sometimes I do layer it with floral scented fragrances and because of the floral notes it does layer wellWhile I don't feel that The Body Shop accurately named this product as it really is more floral than lemon I still love it and I love that my husband actually likes it too. However I would actually like to have bit more lemon in the scent. But it is still a superb moisturizer and worth  stars. More floral than lemon but I still love it,Neutral
Hunting around the bargain bins (one of my usual relaxing and interesting OCD times to pass the day) for beauty products at Marshall's I stumbled upon this unlikely gem with modest unassuming packaging for $..  I've never used Body Shop products but have heard great things about them.  I'm usually a frequent Bath & Body Works customer but I think I'm going to be a more frequent customer of the Body Shop after having tried out this beautiful product :-)  The body butter is . oz and so has a generous amount for well over two or so months if you use it everyday - a small amount goes a long way!!  The body butter is so beautifully aromatic with a feminine fragrance that is long-lasting and smells like a cross between a banana and an exotic flower that does NOT smell like rose or lavender ( flower fragrances I dislike) based I think on their own perfume:The Body Shop Love Etc...(tm) Eau de Parfum.  It is very smooth and spreads rapidly into the skin without any film or greasiness.  It has shea butter and cocoa butter in it that really moisturize the skin.  Also I don't find any parabens on the ingredients like I would find on other labels such as Asquith & Somerset lotions and butters and moisturizers. Wonderful product at a great price. Fragrant smooth moisturizing,long way
I've been a fan of Body Shop body butters for a while. During the winter in Alaska my skin gets very dry. Usually I don't use perfumed versions but the smell of roses is just lovely on this one. Like all their body butters this is a very thick cream that absorbs well on my skin and seems to last all day. The scent is a nice rose not too full bodied but not sweet like a tea rose. Because the scent is fairly strong it could clash with colognes so wear it with a cologne that has a rose note if you want to wear cologne after using this. Lovely scent,Neutral
As someone who is always on the look-out for new facial products I have to say this particular peel kit is a good step above the rest. At a measly $ - this product does the full work of a standard facial and there are a number of benefits that come along with it.First off the average facial runs anywhere from $ to $ in my experience with the higher-end facials running on an hour at some of the more luxurious spas. If you don't mind skipping the cucumber slices and some steam the Olay Microdermabrasion kit does at >least&lt; the work of a standard $ treatment. Multiply the number of times you can actually use this product if you're careful and that could be saving you a ballpark figure of around $! ( x  - ). It doesn't take a math major to know that's a huge amount of savings. Secondly the scent of this product is absolutely divine - no really I wish I could wear it as perfume! When I'm done using this product my husband tells me I smell delicious (enough said). But more importantly yes yes this product absolutely works - and after using it sparingly (x a month) for about three months now my skin feels and looks better than ever with enough in the bottle left over for another two treatments or maybe even three.Bottom line is you will not find something more affordable and reliable than this peeling kit. Even if it's not what you're looking for I would still recommend it because the noticeable results and the cost offset anything wrong with it (and I have yet to have a single problem). Amazon ships it so you know it will arrive prompt (got mine in a day with -day free shipping) and intact. Really as far as I'm concerned this kit really nailed it - Approved! Wonderful - x Facials for Half the Price of One!,Neutral
When I first saw the soap I actually loved the color of the soap. I loved the concept of using Dead Sea mud as soap because I have read about how the Dead Sea mud is very healing.The soap has a light fragrance which I was happy about because some soaps are so overpowering with perfume. I decided to use the soap while I took a shower. I used the soap on my entire body. When I was done showering I instantly could tell how my skin was different. My skin was softer and felt so smooth. And I loved how the soap didn't leave any grim or film on my skin.Sometimes I battle with dry and cracked skin and this soap helped soften those spots. I have used this soap for several weeks and I haven't had any bad reactions. My skin feels healthier and looks more vibrant. I'm totally in love with this soap!Note: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. A must have soap!,Neutral
I love Dead Sea products they're easy on my skin and restores the moisture. The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap is gentle on my face and on my whole body for that matter. I love the fresh clean scent. It doesn't smell overly perfumed just natural.  There is just the right amount of exfoliating mud in the product to help rid your skin of dry cells. Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap,Neutral
I just bought a bar of Adovia's dead sea mud soap to try out. I've used their Dead Sea Mud Mask so I had high hopes for this product.I have combination skin - oily on my forehead and nose but normal to dry everywhere else. The soap didn't dry out my skin in the areas that turn flaky with regular soaps and did a great job of cleansing my skin in the oily areas. I'm going to use this soap after my next workout as I think it will do a great job of cleansing the oily skin on my back and chest.The soap has a pleasant smell and isn't overly fragrant. I don't like soaps or cleansing creams that smell like a bottle of perfume.PROS:Great cleansing bar that doesn't dry out skin.CONS:This soap doesn't lather up like most soaps. But it's not that big of a deal just use a bit more water and it will eventually form enough lather to wash your face. Great Soap for All Skin Types,dry skin
I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap in the shower for a couple weeks. I've used it all over for washing as well as for my face. I like how it fells on my face washing away just enough oil but not leaving my skin too dry.I know the Dead Sea Mud Soap has passed the test for my sensitive skin because it does not irritate my skin when I use it for shaving. I am allergic to most shaving creams so I use bar soap to shave my legs. Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume like the bar from Adovia.The bar itself is a little rough because I take it out of the shower so it dries put in between use. I actually like that because when I use it directly on my legs just for washing it fells like I am exfoliating a little too.It feels like the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap is doing its job washing and not leaving me too dry! It's a good bar of soap for me. Does Not Irritate Sensitive Skin,sensitive skin
I have just completed the third week of using the NATURE'S GATE ORGANICS ACNE TREATMENT SYSTEM and going into the fourth. So far I've been very impressed with the results. And I figure that being at the half way point of the regiment the box claims clearer skin in -weeks that if results aren't at least noticeable--another  weeks won't help.The three-step system is likeProactiv Solution  Step System Kit  Month Supplywhere you use a cleanser toner and a correcting lotion everyday to clear up acne. But instead of Benzoyl Peroxide as the active ingredient NATURE'S GATE... uses % Salicylic Acid.I suffer from mild to moderate adult acne with the occasional eruption of boils that I have to use a prescription topical solution to clear up and I've found that the NATURE'S GATE... has help arrest the development of pimples and clear them up within -days. Also my skin condition is pretty constant and does NOT get better or worse with changes in the weather (besides I'm in Los Angeles CA and we pretty much have constant weather patterns anyway).A pimple would begin to form tenderness and redness along with the bump on my face and the system would keep it from becoming a full blown zit. It would only stay red with slight swelling and then it would clear up. I also noticed that I was getting a boil which is an extreme case of a pimple for those who don't know and NATURE'S GATE... kept that from forming as well.The reason I give only -Stars is because I'm running out of the toner and the cleanser so I don't know if there's enough to make it to the end of -weeks. Also I've noticed that my skin has a dewy/clammy feel to it after a couple of hours from using the toner and I'm not sure if I like that and there's no sun-screen in it so you must use a separate product if you plan on going out. But using the cleanser and toner twice a day and using the lotion only at night before bed I've experienced no drying or irritation and that's a plus.Another good thing is that even though each product has tea tree oil in it it doesn't have that strong herbal odor associated with the oil nor does it have a strong perfume scent of any kind.=============================CLEANSER--Light clean scent (reminded me of candles) and clear. Light lather and rinses away easily.TONER/ASTRINGENT--Clear with a very light citrus scent. I experienced no burning and the toner does not contain alcohol which can dry and irritate the skin and turn it red (for those like me who are sensitive to alcohol).LOTION--Light and creamy white smells like the toner goes on smooth and easy and absorbs quickly.============================I'll update at the end of six-weeks.UPDATE //:I am two days short of  weeks and I've just run out of the cleanser.  The product has kept my face pretty clear but there were a couple of resistant pimples that took longer than the - days to heal. All in all a very satisfactory experience. ***So Far So GOOD***Powerful Weapon in the Fight Against ACNE!,Neutral
I have become more aware of the bad ingredients in many cosmetics and skincare products and have been wondering a lot lately about how I am going to keep my skin clear without slathering it with cancer-causing agents.  Then I stumbled upon this product!  The box says Get Clear Skin in  weeks; however I've only used the product for a few days and already my skin is starting to show signs of vast improvement. (I will come back and update my review if this changes.)  The box comes with complete and clear instructions.  The packaging and labels on the bottles are neither feminine nor masculine.  It's pretty much acceptable for both guys and girls.  The products don't have a medicine smell or any kind of floral or girly smell.  The cleanser and toner are lightly scented but it's nothing that lingers or bothers me.  I can be sensitive to perfume smells due to allergies and this doesn't affect me at all.  The corrective cleanser and controling lotion bottles are labeled with expiration dates on the bottom.  If you are looking to try a skin care system that's as good as if not better in my opinion than the leading brands give this a try.Two additional notes: The lid on the toner leaks ever so slightly.  Beware if you are planning on traveling with this product.  Also the bottles which contain organic product are not labeled for recycling(?). Very good acne treatment system!  Made in the USA.,Neutral
Update: I've been using this for several weeks and I'm a little disappointed.  The results were about average--there was no improvement but no breakouts or rash either.I did run into a problem when I had to travel though.  Two of the three products in this box come in  ounce containers.  With the security regulations currently in place I couldn't bring them on the plane.  So much for my resolution to use this regularly!* * * * *I haven't been a teenager for some time but all I need is one really stressful event to trigger the dreaded mid-nose zit that's waiting for the best opportunity to embarrass me.  On the bright side people think I'm younger than I am.  On the other hand IT LOOKS HORRIBLE!I use a cleanser with salicylic acid at night but use regular soap in the morning.  I could see as I read the directions for this system that I'll be doubling my use of salicylic acid since you're supposed to use this product in the morning and at night.  That might make the difference.  Perhaps the oligopeptide- (whatever that might be) will help or the tea tree oil.The box promises clear skin in six weeks.  I'll check back in then but right now I'll post my initial impressions.The packaging is nice and tasteful.  As an adult I'd be happy to receive this as a gift if it was given privately.  A teenager would probably be mortified to find this (or any other acne treatment) under the Christmas tree.Because I'm sensitive to perfumes I was a little concerned about the fragrances in these products.  As soon as I opened them I knew it wouldn't be a problem.  Each of the three treatments has a different scent but it's pleasant very faint not at all fruity or sweet or gender-specific and triggered no reaction.The cleanser and the lotion both feel smooth and rich and all three products feel and smell like they're made with high quality ingredients.  Only a small amount of each was required.  They did not seem harsh and left my skin feeling clean.Even if they don't completely control the stress breakouts I deal with occasionally I'll probably keep using this product just for the smell and the luxurious feel.  I'll update my review in a few weeks with results. A pleasant treatment... updated with results,Neutral
I have had several bottles of Obsession over the years in fact still have a half-full bottle on my dressing table. I love sweet spicy scents like Shalimar so it's hard to scare me with sweet heavy fragrances that are so ideal for cooler weather. However I never took to Euphoria. Something about it was just wrong for me. At any rate I've been longing for a new fragrance for fall and had my heart set on a bottle of Cassini EDP but it is proving difficult to find. Swinging by TJ Maxx today to check and see if by chance they had some I saw the Obsession Night. Something told me: Just get it. And I did and honestly I am head over heels in love with this perfume. At first sniff it reminded me a great deal of Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle another undeniably fabulous scent. But Obsession Night is wonderful in its own right. I can tell I am going to really enjoy wearing this. I'm delighted. Thoroughly enchanting,Neutral
Not sure about this one its kind of musky a little spicey  hum a fine line between a men's cologne and a woman's perfume! Ok its been on a while about  hours and it smells nice I like it! not a five star perfume for me!,Neutral
I have been using this for years it is very light and musky.  Men love it on meIt is very hard to find I can only buy it online now. My favorite perfume,favorite perfume
This is now my favorite perfume.With Obsession alway wear a little...don't over do...it mixes withyour body chemistry and will linger for a long time...nice. Lovely,Neutral
I do not understand why this is $ cheaper than Euphoria????  Maybe the essential oils I don't know but the scent to this is absolutly splendid!  It is very comparable (strength beauty etc)  to Euphoria but not to be confused with smelling anything like it though.  They are both very alluring in scent and very nice after drydown too.  Wow!!!!  I just love this soooooo much!  Its a little like Midnight Poison by Christian Dior but softer and sweeter or a little like Eiteannes Aiger's Black  it smells like a spice cabinet.  Im not sure everyone will agree with me because no two people see things the same and someone will say: What are you talking about I don't smell that!.  I just gave you the very best I can offer in what I percieve so you will have a better understanding of what it smells like.  I hope I helped a little bit.  This is well worth the $ though.  Happy perfume hunting. SPLENDID!!!!,little bit
I love this lotion it goes on smooth and creamy and my skin just absolutely drinks it up.  Added bonus is it smells pretty good. It's definitely not a froo froo scent just a nice clean scent that won't interfere with your perfume or body spray. Creamy Lotion!,Neutral
It arrived cracked but EWWW it smelled so bad. it has a coconutish smell with a grandma perfume. Threw away and was refunded w/o a hassle but just thought I'd warn people of the nasty smell Hated the smell and arrived damaged,Neutral
Strong scents the one criteria alone that can make me avoid certain colognes. I prefer to wear a cologne that will make me smell good but not overpower so much that it will make people around me uncomfortable. I live in NYC  and everyday I use public transportation to go to school and work. I work in retail and I am very social in college so it's safe to say I am always around people. I like to manage myself to be presentable so I always love wearing cologne. One day I was shopping with my mom at Macy's and we came across the Perfume/cologne section. While my mom was being bothered by five different salesman trying to make a sale I decided to walk over to the men's section and smell some new colognes. Now prior to this I have had no experience with Lacoste scents. For some odd reason I decided to walk over and smell the Lacoste scents that were being offered. While other customers were trying out the different scents I picked up the Lacoste essential and sprayed it on myself without having any idea what I was going to get. To my surprise it was a beautiful summer smell kind of soft but very manly. My favorite part was as you can guess already is that it wasn't a strong smell. However I did not purchase it at that moment and I will tell you why. Department stores such as Macy's charge way higher than you can get elsewhere. Especially in my case because my dad has worked with perfumes/colognes most of his life. He is a distributor for the ingredients needed to make perfume/colognes for many companies. Since he knew a lot of sellers I told him about the Lacoste essential and he acquired it for me for a much cheaper price. Now the duration of the cologne is mind boggling. Keep in mind I leave everyday for college at AM in the morning and by the time I come back home from work afterwards its around PM. It's amazing how even after  hours you can still catch the scent from my shirt considering I usually put on two sprays at most. My girlfriend likes wearing my sweater sometimes because of the cologne scent still lingering on it. Of course I have many other colognes but this is by far my favorite go to scent. This product is wonderful and I am glad that day at Macy's I decided to walk over to the Lacoste section to give this item a try.Hopefully my review helped make your decision! Please let me know if you have any comments or questions thanks for reading! My favorite,Neutral
Lacoste Essential is a great perfume as Lacoste makes great products. Also this is my second time of ordering it and wold recommend it to anyone. Lacoste Essential,Neutral
I love the perfumes in Liz Claiborne's Curve line!  Soul (which seems a bit misnamed) is a fresh natural scent that reminds me of Victoria Secret's Pink yet doesn't come on nearly as strong.  Rather this fragrance--described as consisting of bamboo and water lilies--is more airy less overwhelming while still carrying the same distinctive notes.  Although the scent is floral I don't find it to be at all sweet; it's more of a cool floral.  The fragrance is very concentrated and while it does fade a bit over the course of the day I still catch soft whiffs of it hours after application.  Finally I like the the cute clear bottle though it doesn't have a rubber stopper like the other perfumes in the Curve line do.  Overall Soul is a great fresh fragrance that is ideal for everyday wear but pretty enough for special occasions too. A fresh natural scent,Neutral
Love this perfume it smells great and lasts all day. I've received alot of compliments.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Love it,Neutral
I love using fragrances but so many of them just aren't suited for daily use & are better for certain circumstances or places. (C'mon girls you know what I mean by this. You wouldn't wear the same fragrance on a date as you would at work!)Curve Soul is one of those rare scents that works well just about anywhere. It's got a light & somewhat fruity scent that just has a nice clean smell to it. (Great if you're at work & need a quick pick me up smell!) It's incredibly long lasting as well- I found myself still smelling of this scent hours after I'd put it on. I've also gotten a ton of compliments on it as well!Now I do have to warn some users that if they aren't looking for a nice light scent they're better off looking elsewhere. You won't get any musky scents from this bottle so if you're like the woman who gave me this perfume you will want to check out some of the other scents. Great for all occasions but especially every day use!,Neutral
This perfume is overwhelming when you first put it on then it fades a little as most perfumes do. The scent itself is just not that appealing to me. It's heavy just has &#;too much&#; to it. I always get compliments with Curve Vintage Soul but not one single compliment in over  weeks of wear with this.I love the Curve Vintage Soul but I wanted something lighter for spring/summer this is not it :( Too strong and too old lady,Neutral
I bought this for a grab bag gift for Christmas.  Hopefully who ever picks it out of the grab bag will like it. Liz Claiborne Curve Soul Perfume,Neutral
The perfume does smell very clean but I'm not too fond of it.  It's like a strong soapy smell for me.  It lasts just about the entire work day which is what I want in a perfume -biggest reason I gave this four stars.  For $ I think it was worth trying out. Not for me,Neutral
When this perfume came i open it up smell it omg it smell so good and have a sweet.smell to it last a while not to strong do a nice smell a nice smell,Neutral
I love this perfume. It is great for everyday. It's really light and I smell a citrus tone to it. I had gotten a free sample from a company and I quickly ran out and had to find someone that carried it!  Thanks Amazon! Light and summery and great for everyday,Neutral
Liz Claiborne does it again. This perfume is light and fresh and adding to that my hubby loves it. Five stars easy! great smell,Neutral
Curve Soul is a very light airy fresh and casual fragrance.  Clean and subtle not overpowering and pungent.  This is a great perfume for everyday wear.  This scent would be good on most women.  The age range of wearers in my opinion would be teens all the way to 's; 's and older should wear a more mature scent. Light - Fresh - Casual,Neutral
I put off looking for a new natural shampoo for a while because its hard as hell to find shampoo with exactly what i want ( or  main natural ingrediants that make my hair look really good) without the companies adding a crapload of other stuff i dont want in my hair... i finally started looking for some and this one is the rd one i bought... only thing about shopping online is that its hard to read the back of the bottle to see all of the ingrediants... like i always do when i shop offline... so i just pick whatever looks like might not piss me off when i finally get it and read the backi used this about  times before i finally really read the back only because when i used it i actually liked how it made my hair look (the best out of the )...  a lot like the shampoo i'd been using for  plus years until they decided to stop making it -creme of nature (the original older version) -  which i didn't think i'd be able to match... but the combo of this plus jason's aloe vera conditioner both have the same ingrediants as creme of nature (the main  or  i look for )...  so i didnt care what was in it just that my hair finally looked like it used to... not until after the nd day did i start to notice my hair was getting dryer... this happened to me before... used a hair product... looked great... then a couple days later went from great to dry to breaking off... turns out its the alcohol they put in it.. that plus the perfume.. which is alcohol on top of alcohol.. not good for your hair.. at all... i would never put any kind of alcohol in my hair unless i was trying to eff it up on purpose... dry it out and give myself dead ends...  plus never liked the smell of it.. its strong and stinky.. turns out because of the cheap smelling perfume they dumped in it... i dont know if it was this shampoo or jasons conditioner thats doing the drying out but I think its the conditioner because that has Stearyl Alcholol at the top of the ingrediants which means theres a lot of it in there... why is it so hard for these companies to just put a handful of ingrediants and leave out all the extra crap that always ends up being the stuff that does damage and should'nt be in it...  doesn't get any dumber than putting alcohol in any beauty product.. the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn't be in anyhthing that you want to make soft and shiny because it'll cancel itthe  most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera wheat germ oil jojoba and dimethicone.... hydrolyzed milk protein and honey help too but i only look for the first ... i actually bought all  of those things pure and organic on here by themselves so i dont have to deal with all the extra bad stuff these companies add... but i've been too lazy to mix em together and use em... i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  the dimethicone left it shineyi  wont use jason's aloe vera conditioner again but I might try this shampoo again just to check to make sure it's not both doing the drying Liked It At First But Then Turned Dry -  Has Alcohol and Perfume,Neutral
When I first read the manufacturer's description of this product it was so hyped up that it seemed like snake oil revisited.  It touted the ions that refreshed the air--a property of the natural citrus oil not some special ionization technique. Recommended uses included deodorizing diaper pails--a task that this light freshener is probably not up to. The bottle still claims that the product is:Useful in the Art and Science of Feng Shui. (Which part of spraying the container is art and which science I wonder.]Restores Balance Joy and Harmony.It also claims to Purify Freshen and Protect (Purify...Protect?!)Here's what it does:One or two sprays away from your face emit a pleasant orange scent which will awaken your senses when your unventilated office threatens to lull you to a stupor.  I suppose one could open a window instead but sometimes there either are no windows or the outside is noisy and/or has its own unpleasant odors.Here are the features I like about this product:. Non-aerosol delivery--no flourocarbons.. Up to  sprays from the . ounce container.. Made of pure essential oils distilled from real citrus peels (but are they oranges?) with nothing else added.. A nice scent that is not overpowering.. Not tested on animals.. Portable.A good product although you might want to try the somewhat more expensive liquid natural extracts available.  These come in more scents and blends and can be used in perfumes colognes etc.  As for Feng Shui get a book from Amazon.com to learn the many components above and beyond the extracted scent of a citrus peel. A Reduction in  Hyperbole,Neutral
We are very happy with this soap and just ordered our second pack and definitely will continue to order more.  We were struggling with dry skin with the cold winter weather and the heat indoors.  I feel that most soaps and shower gels do a bad job of helping the change of temperature and lack of humidity.  They just contributed to our dry skin with all the unnecessary perfumes and dyes.  This soap just feels so natural and so balanced when I put it on my skin.  And we have definitely noticed a difference on our skin.  Highly recommend. Great soap for sensitive skin,dry skin
Clairol Shimmer Light Shampoo Blonde & Silver  oz.  is a popular-priced shampoo that really so far as I'm concerned delivers what it promises.  It reinforces blonde or light brown hair color giving it lots of sheen; and it punches up blonde highlights in between those expensive trips to the beauty salon.  (And we all know that to go blonde even just for highlights means you might as well keep a sleeping bag at your favorite salon.)  And although I haven't tried most of the colors I can tell you that several years ago I wore my naturally reddish hair in a reddish shade how's about that! And the Clairol Red Shampoo punched that up almost too much.  Finally this shampoo is relatively economical as just a little dab will do you and it lathers up nicely with a pleasant aroma to which perfume thankfully I am not allergic and I'm allergic to so many scents.  No downside that I can see. Delivers What It Promises,Neutral
I have shoulder length fairly thick wavy hair with a bit of frizz throughout; not a lot but enough to make it a PAIN!!  Over the years I have tried everything on the market at one time or another.  I recently stumbled across this product on AMAZON and after reading some of the reviews I decided I would try it.  I am so glad I did because this product is really excellent.  Although a tiny bit sticky while applying it truly does what it claims.  It dries with no trace of sticky or crunchiness that I have gotten with other products.  It helps shape curls/waves but also conditions my hair while it tames frizzies.  My hair no longer feels dry and brittle.  A little bit goes a LONG way so it will last a long time.  It smells very pleasant simple and clean instead of heavily perfumed and is easy to apply. Excellent product for coarse wavy/frizzy hair!,little bit
ADOVIA's mud mask is formulated with Dead Sea Black Mud Beeswax and lots of natural moisturizers including Jojoba Oil Evening Primrose Oil and Olive Oil. I followed the directions and applied a think layer onto my clean skin. I waited  minutes (the directions say -) and enjoyed a glass of wine while the mask dried. Then I rinsed it off with lukewarm water. I might have liked the results a bit better if I followed the mask with ADOVIA's products but instead I used my regular toner and moisturizer but my skin still felt a little more hydrated than usual.There were many things I liked about this mask and it was different than what I have used in the past:) it dried without feeling tight or uncomfortable) it was easy to get off with the lukewarm water and a cloth) there was no perfumey odor or smell at all - it was very natural) it was not greasy but went on smooth) a little bit goes a long way so the . fl oz bottle will last quite a long timeI love that ADOVIA's products are mineral based and I'm looking forward to trying other products they have to offer! I love that ADOVIA's products are mineral based,little bit
I am a bit of a feet fetish in that I love to have my feet look their absolute best. This includes keeping up on my regular pedicures; and at home beauty regiments. I found that the Profoot Care Heel Rescue had a really nice thick texture. I felt it against my fingertips and it felt super soft and silky smooth;  and it wasn't too greasy I like that. I love this non traditional container and can't wait to re-use it for my own at home facial/body moisturizer home-made treatments.The jar is a bit heavy but the pump style make for little to no messy residue; which never clogs and dispenses effortless. It come in a oz size and depending on usage should last quite a bit.Upon receiving the Profoot Care Heel Rescue I could not wait to try it. I performed a extra special foot scrub and exfoliate treatment during an evening shower. I made sure to carefully pat dry my feet but making certain not to overly dry them. I then massaged the 'Profoot Care Heel Rescue'into my semi-wet skin; which I must admit this product really made my feet feel soft. I then wore my comfy bed socks and went to bed. The next morning my feet still looked and felt absolutely amazing; they weren't dry or crackly looking; even my heels held up great.Although I do not suffer from having excessive drying skin I do believe this would help to combat dry skin. It was so addictive to how my feet felt that I couldn't wait to use it on my hands elbows and knees.This stuff is amazing. It has a nice light aroma that is almost odorless; so there's no heavy perfumes or dyes.I definitely would recommend this product for people of all age: teenagers young adults and senior citizens. Although it is not a foot cream to combat severe medical conditions as Psoriasis I do believe with continual usage it will help to improve skin's texture and elasticity. I genuinely love this product and would highly recommend for both men and women.The key with any new product is continual usage. You are not going to have long-term success over night; it takes time but be assured this product works. I would think it would be safe for people with sensitive skin; because of the ingredient sodium benzoate it might be best to use in small quantities; I'm not sure I would use on one's face either.This product is intended to be used to help aid and to repair cracked calloused and dry feet.This Review has been brought to you by 'Awakened'.** See all my reviews:http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAZBCCBLPN/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF&sort;_by=MostRecentReview Foot Cream to the Rescue; Superb Moisture,dry skin
I really love this shampoo.  It does such a great job and really lives up to it's name Clean.  I sometimes use a particular mousse that really leaves a lot of build up in my hair and with ONE rinse of this it's out and you don't have to use a second rinse (although you might want to but certainly not necessary).  It has the most gentle of fragrance to it (almost nothing but a tiny hint of a soft perfume to it so as not to smell of nothing).I find this really makes my hair clean and shiny and when I use it with the matching conditioner it's much easier to straighten because it leaves your hair fresh and well moisturised.  Neutrogena make fantastic products and I buy heaps of this when I'm in the States.  I wish I could buy it here because it's almost all I'd use.  I really love it and can't recommend it highly enough. Works so well :-),Neutral
This product is what I wanted.  Light hold without any perfumes. Nice to find something as advertised and promptly received. just as advertised,Neutral
Very good product makes my hair shinier than the other heat protectants I have tried. The bottle has a nice design with a lock feature so I don't have to worry about it opening in my bag. Mister itself delivers a very fine mist over a very large area. My only complaint is the smell which reminds me of the blue polo sport Ralph Lauren perfume that I detest. I am not sure how to describe the scent but it wears off extremely fast which is great because it can be very overpowering when first sprayed. I would repurchase. It works,Neutral
I bought this stuff because I liked the name the bottle was pretty and  wanted to try something new. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Many people think it smells good but I think it smells like old lady perfume. It also broke me out SO BAD which hasn't ever happened before. It's also a mediocre bronzer. I've used way better products so far. Give Smile! You're Darker a shot! :) Will never buy this product again.,Neutral
I paid  dollars for this lotion in a tanning salon. And I was very happy with it. My skin got really dark. And it smells fantasic. Almost like Ralph Lauren perfume... Or Paris Hilton Twilight... I generally prefer a tingle lotion though so now im using a lotion called Siren. But they stopped making it. So i tried Smolder. And its also a really great lotion. Excellent lotion.,Neutral
I sometimes will go without wearing makeup when I do that I will turn to my Clinique mild soap because it is great for keeping my skin clean without over drying.If you wear a full face of makeup (concealer foundation powder) you might want to go for a stronger soap.My husband borrows this face wash from time to time it gives him a noticeable clean glow.This is a neutral smelling cleanser perfect for me since I do not care for the perfumed soaps. Perfect mild soap for normal/combination skin.,Neutral
I like all curve perfumes for women but this is one I had not tried yet. It smells so good! And lasts a good while. The product arrived on schedule and the company that did the shipping included with the order a free sample of another perfume (which also smells great! ) and a free small comb and mirror combination. Also I got a coupon for an under eye cream treatment and also a free sample of that as well! And also walmart sells the same perfume and it was way cheaper here on amazon! A Good Buy!,Neutral
WOW am I happy with this purchase. I spent all day shopping on cyber Monday and needed some new Parfum. This was one of my picks after reading other reviews. I took a chance and glad I did.  A unique smell that is flowery but so much more.  Then you also get some woodsy scent with the floral scent.  Really sexy and scentual.  I personally wear it day and night. I don't get out much due to health issues but need that uplifting feeling and this just makes me smile. The scent lingers which I love and changes slightly through all the top mid and bottom notes.  Totally agrees with my own body chemistry. I was wondering if it contained pheromones and another reviewer said it does. I thought so because I have used another brand which is all about pheromones.  Mix that with the scents of this perfume and you got a winner.  The sprayer sprays wide so I only need one spray on neck and I spray or try to spray lightly on my wrists. This will last a long time. The seller gets  stars for great service. Delivered on time and I ordered  perfumes that day and both came together with a few samples and I was very impressed with the shipping and the freebies.  Excellent. Curve Soul Sexy Bold Beautiful,long time
It practially has no scent at all!I mean it's just so light that it does not make any difference. The packaging is very nice though and I like the bottle. But that's it. It's not offensive but nor is it impressive. What am I supposed to say about a perfume that just has a whiff of a smell and nothing more? Curve Soul is not my kind of perfume :( No Scent!,Neutral
Right amount of perfume for the price. long-lasting sweet like marshmallows and sugar with a tinge of spice. I love it! Just Right,Neutral
Mine came in the box I'm used to.  It has the logo.  It smells just like my old bottle.  It is Eau De Toilette so it smells a bit different out of the bottle than the perfume sample I have  but that's to be expected.  Within a few seconds they are the same.Strong vanilla notes with a powdery soft base and a hint of musk.  The pink comes from some strawberry.  It smells like something you want to eat.  My teenage son loves it and always comments positively on it.  I looked at the website (pink sugar dot it no spaces) and the packaging and font- everything looks legit.I'm not sure why people are saying it is fake but maybe if it was a problem it's been resolved. Matches up with product website smells the same as tester,Neutral
I love this scent.  Its never too overpowering like perfumes can be.  It is sweet and powdery with a definate feminine twist. Sweet and sexy,Neutral
Best perfume I own everyone around me loves the candy smell! &#;Blue Sugar&#; is great on the males the perfect compliment to Pink Sugar Addicting,Neutral
This perfume honestly smells delicious I can't get enough of it. If it wasn't so expensive I would even spray it on me before I go to bed! However if you do not like perfumes that are on the sweeter side then this might not be for you. My mom doesn't like it because she thinks it's too sweet. It has a floral/sweet scent almost a little musky as well. I just got it in today so I'm excited to wear it out because a lot of people say they constantly get compliments on it. And it DOES last through the whole day! I don't know why people say it doesn't... You actually have to be careful on how much you put on because it is strong and does last long and it lingers on your clothes. That's what you get with a high quality perfume. The price is also amazing on Amazon. In the department stores this larger bottle will cost you about  bucks! But I got it for under . And shipping was right on time.Definitely recommended!! Amazing perfume!,Neutral
I visited a Sephora recently and the saleslady told me that this was her favorite scent. As soon as I smelled it I fell in love! She gave me a small bottle of it as a sample and I've worn it every day since.  I'm completely obsessed. I've never had nice perfume so I was really surprised that I could still smell it on my wrist when I got home from an  hour work shift. While I was at work I couldn't help but tell my co-workers and as soon as I mentioned that I was trying a new perfume they all said so that's what I've been smelling! What's it called?! I never thought I would like a Calvin Klein product so much and I can't wait to buy myself a full bottle.I really don't know how to describe this scent. It's kind of musky and a little bit sweet. It's not over-powering either. One of my co-workers described it as a really nice person smell like someone who goes outside and naturally smells really good from being around woods and flowers. Even though it's not over-powering it's still a little heavy so if you wanted something light for the summer then this probably isn't for you. But I completely love it. Amazing!,little bit
Before I've never remembered to put on perfume so often. But with Euphoria I just love smelling myself :) So I put it on everyday.  It smells dreamy after it's been on at least  hours.It also attracts men like bees to honey. I actually don't like that cuz I'd rather have a man be attracted to me and not my perfume :) First perfume I just Love,Neutral
This . ounce eau de PARFUM spray is easily averaging $ at department stores. Amazon.com had it in stock for less than half that at $ when I bought it. This bottle is LARGE. Brand new in sealed packaging not a scratch on the box or bottle.Top notes are pomegranate and persimmons followed by black orchid lotus blossom and champaca flower and the base notes are amber cream black violet and wood.I tend to like perfumes with that amber and woodsy base it works really well on me. The chosen fruits and flowers overlaying this are not overpowering at all and this perfume LASTS all day. Be cautious of overspraying because it is quite powerful but without being stinky!Love Calvin Klein scents this one is a total winner that I'll make sure to keep on my shelf! Oh WOW! Great scent huge bottle!,Neutral
This is my daughter's absolute favorite scent.  I ordered it as a surprise for Christmas.  She says she wants to take herself on a date when she wears it!  Ha! Love this perfume,Neutral
I had bought this for me a while back and my sister loved it so much that I ordered it again to gift it to my sister and we both love this fragrance. This is my second purchase on this perfume!,Neutral
The wife just loves this product and uses it often.  I will definitely replace it with the same the next time she needs such. Perfume:,Neutral
I first found this perfume looking through a magazine. The sample test strip was there and unused which was a plus for me. I had put it on my wrist and the scent stayed for a long period of time. I just received this in the mail today andI am glad that I ordered it.!!  It is a really light fragrance with a long staying power so a little go a long way. I have only had it on now for about an hour so I will give another update and let you know what kind of comments I receive on the scent. Can't wait!!!!!!!!!! The smell is great,long way
Exotic floral-fruity fragrance. The main notes are rose hip Japanese apple green leaves Lotus black orchid red woods black violet and amber.  This is my wife's favorite perfume and she describes it as long lasting and good quality perfume.  This is also at  to  bucks a good price for this perfume of this size.  I would also suggest getting this straight from Amazon as opposed to other sellers or a retailor you trust as there are lots of counterfeits being sold out there. Good quality perfume for women,favorite perfume
This is a beautiful and light perfume. Perfect for everyday use. I would recommend. It's light and pretty. Very feminine. Light and pretty!,Neutral
I loved the top notes of this perfume- all fruity and sensual.  It really was a gorgeous fruity scent.  But then I got beyond the top notes and all I smelled was musk.  Lots of musk and it was a very masculine musk.  I smelled like a man most of the day.  Needless to say I'm not a huge fan.  If I could only capture those top notes...And people aren't kidding on the staying power.  This stuff lasts forever. Too Musky,Neutral
A friend of mine wears this scent and I know that some perfumes don't always smell the same when they are on your own body but I took a risk and I bought it and it paid off!!  I love this perfume!  I get a lot of compliments on it! My new favorite scent!!!,Neutral
One spray of this perfume and everyone will be asking what you are wearing. I originally bought this for a trip to Vegas but ended up buying this again and again. The smell is not your typical light and flowerly perfume. It is not manly in any way nor does it carry a woodsy smell. But it is a great perfume to have for those days you feel a little mysterious and mischievous! Ohh la l,Neutral
I love this fragrance soooooooo flippin muchhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!! It is my def. my favorite out of all the perfumes i have so far (and i do have a lot! :P) So take my word for it... It will be well worth it!!! This will be that one perfume i will buy again and again!!! Yayyy! :D OMGGG HEAVINLY!!!!!,Neutral
I love this scent. It is pretty strong and a little bit goes a long way. It's a nice clean scent that every woman would love! Great perfume!,little bit
Wonderful intoxicating scent!  Didn't last long though.  I give the scent itself five stars but the length of the scent  hardly merit's giving any star at all.  Very costly for such a week perfume-sorry Calvin. Im with Holly!,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I find it kind of musky but in a good way.  I have received many compliments on the fragrance. Great fragrance.,Neutral
As I mentioned before cant go wrong with Bvlgari perfume for men. Another order for a friend of mine. Smells soooo good!!! Bvlgari by Notte for men,Neutral
I love BVLGARI perfumes-- both men and women. And love the way this one smells- fresh elegant just a little spicy and manly. I love the bottle and the entire packaging. It's just great! And the price is amazing too. Like many I also think that Amazon is a great place to buy stuff that are way too expensive elsewhere. SIMPLY GREAT!!,Neutral
Good smell but doesn't amazed me when I wear it. It's a good day-time perfume. Smell good but not amazed,Neutral
When I saw the reviews for this perfume i felt it would be good and moreover amazons price was relatively very low but when i happened smell it it just sucks...too strong smells like a powder as someone was mentioning like a dog with flea powder i would not recommend this perfume to anyone. i wonder how people like this one..very badddd........plz dont buy it......... worst ever,Neutral
I was worried about how this smelled. I have read alot of review saying it is too strong on other sites. I went to the mall and saw it in a gift set cheaper than on here. I figure it I didn't like it I could give it to my sister. After smelling it I am not giving it up. I used to own Paris Hilton's self titled perfume but that was too sweet. This  is an adult sweet. It is floral and feminine. I love rose and you can smell the rose in it. When I have the money I will be getting the . (as I got a oz perfume oz lotion and oz shower gel.) I love it.,Neutral
Or does this perfume smell like mouthwash? Somebody actually gave this to me for my birthday. I couldn't believe it. Anyway mouthwash doesn't smell bad but still. I was expecting maybe a light floral scent. I'll probably give this away to one of my younger cousins. Is It Really Just Me?,Neutral
I rated this product with  stars because I just don't like it. I don't HATE it and it doesn't repluse me but I will never wear it again because it just doesn't smell nice. After buying her other two perfumes (the Paris Hilton Women original one and Can Can) and loving those SO much (they're very sexy and girly) I decided to buy this Just Me one because I thought I'd love it just as much...but no. I'm usually drawn to sexy/sweet/girly perfumes. For example a couple of my faves are Britney Spears - Fantasy Ralph Lauren - Hot Beyonce - Heat Victoria's Secret - Sexy Little Things Noir and the other Paris Hilton ones I previously mentioned. So my advice to you: save yourself the disappointment and go buy one of those... Clearly by the reviews some people actually like this so if you're willing to try it I'd go with a smaller bottle so you can test it out. BLAH,Neutral
This is one of those perfumes I just had to come back to. I used to wear it years ago and loved it then. However I decided to move on. I bought it for my mom for xmas and she enjoyed it as well. I recently decided to spray myself with some of hers and fell in love with it all over again. It's a perfect scent for spring and summer. My boyfriend loves it on me! :) Light sweet flowery and feminine.,Neutral
This perfume is the kind that makes heads turn as people try to follow that amazing smell. It's seductive it's playful it's naughty and it's sweet. I wear this stuff on nights out with my boyfriend as a provocative touch. Makes a girl feel naughty I swear it. Not Very - Utterly Irresistible!,Neutral
I've been using this perfume for over  years now I cannot get tired of it. It's perfect not as sweet but not as citric just the perfect note! My perfume!,Neutral
I have purchased this perfume many times.It is one if the best I have ever owned.I have also purchased other &#;high end&#; perfumes that do not last the day but with Fantasy I can still smell it when I get home from work.It is an excellent everyday perfume! Wonderful,Neutral
In my opinion $ for  ounce of this perfume is a bit too pricey. However I was looking for a practical and affordable perfume that I can wear to school or outside without ripping a hole in my wallet or making people choke. This perfume met my expectations for the most part.The scent is very sweet. My friend said that it smelled like cotton candy. However with it a little goes a long way as it can become overpowering very fast. As I found out the hard way.I was considering blind-buying this or buying Lolita Lempicka which was six dollars more expensive. If I could choose again I'd probably choose Lolita Lempicka. OK for its price... mostly,long way
I finally decided to purchase this perfume after noticing that I would go to smell it every single time I was at Target! I just really like the smell. It somewhat reminds me of some of the summer Escada fragrances they release every year. It's got a similar feel. The bottle is cool although not horribly well made. Overall though I really love this perfume. For about the $ I spent on it I think it's a steal! Nice Perfume!,Neutral
I just got this perfume for Valentine's Day.  I love it!  Yes it is sweet smelling as another reviewer mentions but it's a pleasant sweetness.  Cotton candy does describe it actually.  But who says grownups don't like smelling yummy??  There's a hint of vanilla as well and overall I think the combo is fantastic!I love Curious and now I love Fantasy too!  They are two very different perfumes so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  I will say though that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious.  You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep!  Which I don't mind at all...I recommend this of course but I recommend you sample it before you buy.  Just because you liked Curious doesn't mean you will like this one. Sweet and long lasting,Neutral
BUYER BEWARE: I read some reviews about this being fake or defective. If you're wanting to buy this but you're on the fence just order directly from AMAZON! They will not give you any fake perfume. DO NOT ORDER FROM ANY OTHER SELLER! I love this perfume it lasts all day and smells so good! I will definitely be purchasing this again! Ordered directly from Amazon,Neutral
I love this perfume&#;I've been wearing it every day for a few years and get a lot of compliments on it. The . oz bottle lasts a long time too. You don't need to apply very much at all!I would mention though that I think this scent is better for younger women. I'm twenty and think it's perfect for my age and for women probably up to  years older than I am. The best way to describe the scent is kind of sugary but it's not overwhelming at all so long as you don't apply too much! Big fan,long time
I was in search for the perfect perfume. I did research online read reviews looked at polls... so I went to the department store to smell the top  perfumes. I was kind of disgusted-- I think I tried almost every single female perfume available and I was ready to give up when my fiance kindingly asked about the Britney Spears Fantasy perfume. I laughed at the round pink girly bottle and sprayed it on the tester paper to amuse him. I took a whiff with no expectations and I fell in love. My fiance smelled and couldn't believe how amazing it smelled. In fact the whole Fantasy line smells fantastic! It resembles a cotton candy scent without being too teeny bopper-ish it definitely has a very elegant yet playful scent. I love the whole line the regular fantasy is my favorite because my fiance always wants to rip my clothes off when he smells it. Very sexy feminine and not too young. Love it and it is my new favorite. Sugar Spice and everything nice,Neutral
I know it's hard trusting a complete strangers judgment on something you've never even tried but I honestly think you'd still be very pleased if you bought this perfume before smelling it first! This is one of my few favorite perfumes! I can't really explain the scent but I can say it's different than everything else I've ever smelled. I'm just in LOVE with this perfume! I get many compliments when I wear it! My sister bought me brittany spears curious for my birthday since she knew I loved fantasy and by my surprise I didn't like the scent at all! It smelled like what a lot of elderly women wear. I actually exchanged it for another perfume! So if you've tried curious and didn't like it don't think fantasy is similar! And if your thinking of getting this perfume get it! You WON'T be unhappy!! One of my ultimate favorite perfumes!,Neutral
I'm a big fan of Britney Spears.  I bought the FANTASY by Britney Spears perfume.  This perfume smells so good I love it.  I should definantly look into the rest of her perfume line. FANTASY by Britney Spears,Neutral
I got this perfume the month before i would graduate from high school. It came with a really cute sequined pink and green striped tote bag. I think Fantasy smell nicer than Curious because it smelled more like candy. The bottle is cute itself. smells nicer and sweeter than curious,Neutral
I actually never wore any cologne or perfumes growing up. However i remember one day I was at a target and i came across this bottle. I read who it was and at the time i was obessed over Britney Spears so i decided to take whiff. OMG this scent is very feminine but it is soooo delicious! Every time i smell it i wish i could eat it! Almost like cotton candy. Ever since then I ahve become obsessed with celebrity perfumes. Britney Spears started it all for me lol Great scent I would recommend. She started it all,Neutral
I never would have thought to buy this perfume me NOT being a Britney Spears fan in all. I tried some of this at my friend's house and I loved it. I finally got myself a bottle! It smells really good and fresh. It's kind of sweet smelling and it's also very warm and inviting. It's so soft & elegant and can be worn anytime whether you're snuggling up to watch movies with your boyfriend or going to a wedding! Whatever the occassion Fantasy is perfect! Love It!!!!,Neutral
If it were affordable I would say ten stars!  I have to cut back on a star due to the price. You can find this at drug store wallys etc but it's pricey for me anyhow.It is a perfect scent if you like sweet but not gag-you-sweet.  There are knockoffs of this at the dollar store and if you like that but want something a little smoother get Spears' perfume.  It's light but noticable.I usually end up washing perfume off.  I hate ultra strong or asian inspired scents or too fruity or too musky :)  I love this perfume because it's lovely.  A very girly/womanly scent without being overpowering.My niece and I tried it on at JC Penny and kept smelling our wrists going on and on about how wonderful the scent was.  I plan to buy her a bottle for her birthday. If it was cheaper I'd get some for myself!Normally I wear Bath and Body's Noel Christmas scent or their cotton scent.  I also love original Chloe but again..lol..too much money for perfume.**Edit: I have to admit I love a bargain..hoping that you do too I found the 'copy cat' scent at most Dollar Tree stores to be even better!  That's right..better.  I have five bottles of it I even use it as an air scent in my bedroom!  I did buy the original real Fantasy for my niece for Christmas and compared the two a few times.  No kidding the dollar store knock-off version is even better! Woohoo!!! Beautiful scent and bottle overpriced but sweet scent,Neutral
I love all things perfume!  I have quite the collection from high-end $+ to lower-end perfumes.  This is my favorite! i love it!,Neutral
I basically grew up despising perfumes because most of them just smelled like old ladies to me but I was very impressed by this perfume. It doesn't remind me of old ladies at all; it's very sweet and unique. I don't know how people could ever dislike this perfume I think it smells amazing. This perfume changed my mind about perfumes in general and now I'm more open to trying new stuff. I Love This!,Neutral
This perfume is simply wonderful. It lasts the entire day. I use it for my sons and even when I wash ther clothes the perfume lingers. Plus the price is reasonable. Heavenly,Neutral
Well apparently I'm not sophisticated enough for this perfume because it smells amazing on my mom and rather boring on me. So I bought her a gift set with the eau de toilette and she loved it.To me (and I have no idea what notes are in it) it's a very sharp scent. It has a hint of rose or rose pepper that gives it a quite feminine air yet with no sweetness. I think it is better for summer time because it's rather cold and fresh. Definitely a very sophisticated perfume. For sophisticated woman,Neutral
I've read so many positive reviews of this perfume that I have to believe that this is one that depends heavily on skin chemistry as on my this smelled nothing like the description nor what I've read in other people's reviews.  The scent smelled weird on me- really really weird.  I think the notes are floral but they smelled like plastic on me.  The fragrance is described as musky but I couldn't smell a bit of musk.  Using this was not a pleasant experience so needless to say I won't be doing so again.  I wish I could make this review more helpful but I what I smelled really defied description so the best advice I can offer is don't buy this without a test run first. Test before Buying!,Neutral
This smells so wonderful I get compliments all the time asking what I'm wearing.  It's sexy yet not overpowering.  A little is all you need. Love this perfume!,Neutral
I love this scent and receive so many compliments when I wear it. It is a soft exotic vanilla scent that is so awesome. Will re-purchase when finished. Favorite Perfume Ever,favorite perfume
I got a free sample of this perfume from a department store.  It's a nice fragrance but I thought it was too heavy for my taste and the spiciness reminded me more of a man's perfume than a woman's.  I really loved the Versace Bright Crystal though. A little heavy,Neutral
I have used this as my winter scent for a few years now. I am a flight attendant so I want a scent that will last the day but isn't too strong and this fits the bill. It has a pronounced scent of coconut which I love and mixed with vanilla and amber. It is a warm familiar scent without smelling like candy. I get compliments every day on it and people say you smell great not I like your perfume. My other favorite is Thierry Mugler Angel but I found it is wayyyy too strong for an airplane so I wear that when I'm going out. If you like Angel you will enjoy Crystal Noir. It is warm and inviting and yet subtle at the same time. My favorite winter scent,Neutral
I ordered directly through Amazon and I must say that the low price caused me to be a bit skeptical about the authenticity and/ or quality of this item. I had already loved this perfume & purchased a  ounce bottle for fifty bucks at Ulta. Same day I came on here and saw they had the three ounce for less than the  oz at Ulta! I couldn't believe my eyes. I have received my perfume from Amazon and it arrived very quickly. Not only is it identical in every way except the size of course it is fresh and perfect. I have since returned the  oz back to Ulta as I didn't even open it and now have my triple size bottle for an unbeatable price.The scent itself seems like coconuts spicy florals and fruits kind of exotic and hard to describe. Very dressy and ladylike. Mature smelling but not grandma-ish. This is strong for an EDT (the perfect strength however) and two spritz lasts all day for me. I can't imagine how strong the EDP is and have never tried it.The bottle is beautiful colored glass with a huge chunky lid that is multifaceted.Note: It is made in Italy. Also Amazon assured me that if the product was old fake or weak they would refund my money. People are put off by the no returns policy on fragrances but Amazon still has the best customer service ever. After this experience I will definitely keep buying my perfumes here. Great EDT; Great Service,Neutral
This perfume is my favorite for the evening. I use just one pump and it last all day. Not a big fan of the top so I place another one since it took too much space. Great for eveing,Neutral
A great deep and rich perfume that stays on you all day.  This bottle lasts me over a year with - sprays every day.  Its my favorite and my signature scent and I always get compliments when I wear it.  Added bonus that I've never met anyone else who also wears this product. My signature scent for years,Neutral
This has real lavender oil in it -- and a good one too if you like florals -- lavendula angustifolia.  This does not have any antiseptic or camphorous notes.  On the downside this body wash does contain some other fragrance.  The type of fragrance is unspecified on the label -- I'm assuming a generic perfume scent.  It complements the lavender scent though.  I hadn't tried this body wash before and didn't want to buy a six pack but I couldn't find a single bottle on Amazon.  I ended up buying one at drugstore[dot]com. Out of the bottle the scent is very subtle but leaves a lingering perfumy scent on my skin.  It's not unpleasant and I don't have a real problem with it except I think the perfume smell is stronger than the lavender and I hate to say it perhaps a little cheap smelling. For that reason I give it  / stars (but closer to   ;-). I've become more sensitive and discriminating when it comes to fragrances. It is subtle though -- I can't smell it unless I put my nose to my skin.As far as its intended purpose this stuff lathers divinely and gets me super clean. It makes my skin oh-so-soft too -- I find that surprising since it contains sodium laureth sulfate AND sodium laurel sulfate which are both very drying.  In the long run it might just backfire and dry my skin out.  Ah well it's an inexpensive brand and you get what you pay for (and for the price it's decent).  I took a picture of the ingredient list and uploaded it.Overall I think it's worth a try but I definitely recommend buying a single bottle before committing to a six pack.  Sense of smell is a subjective and very individual thing. Contains real lavender oil and....,dry skin
After reading the bottle I assumed Ivory was all natural minus dies and perfumes but they do have them may I am getting confused with dove. But I was dissapointed in that Not all that Natural,Neutral
This body butter does a fantastic job of moisturizing but unfortunately the scent is so overpowering it's basically useless to me. It smells like cheap perfume so you have to use it very sparingly if at all. I'm a man so I especially don't want to smell like perfume but I can't imagine women liking this scent either. Because of the overwhelming smell I don't like to apply it anywhere except my legs and even the only in small amounts. Applied too close to my face it becomes distracting. What's frustrating is that I bought this because some body butter that I got from Bath and Body Works was also too heavily scented. The quest to find unscented body butter continues. can't stand the smell,Neutral
The body butter has a nice organic scent consisting of some green notes accented by just a hint of floral in the background. I noted that it contains jasmine and cucumber so that would definitely explain the freshness of this scent. While some men might be scared off by anything with jasmine in it I wouldn't classify it as a floral scent at all and could easily be considered unisex. I absolutely love it - it's not cloying at all.Although this product is rich in moisturizers the consistency was not quite what I expected. I have used a lot of body butters and my favorites are always super thick just like butter! Hempz body butter is more like a rich body cream with a lighter whipped feeling. It's softer to the touch and is not nearly as dense as say The Body Shop Body Butters. Nonetheless it is a great moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and silky with a nice dewy glow to it. This body butter also has very good long term moisturizing capabilities keeping my skin feeling moisturized all day. I also noticed that it's very good at repairing dry cracked skin on my feet.The scent is not as long lasting as some of my favorite body butters and doesn't seem as intense once I apply it. I don't really care in this case as I normally use fragrance anyhow. But I do know some women prefer strongly scented body moisturizers in lieu of perfume so this probably wouldn't work for them. Nice stuff but more like a body cream than body butter,Neutral
Being the fair skinned red that I am I have to watch how much sun exposure I get or I get burned badly.First thing I noticed was that the stuff is almost a rust colored but rubs in completely invisible and doesn't feel greasy at all it feels more like liquid baby powder as you rub it in. The other thing that I REALLY liked about it is that it's fragrancy free (I'm allergic to most fragrances) no smell whatsoever!So to test how well it worked I slathered a bunch on my neck face arms and legs then headed outside to work on the car in full sun (+ degrees even). After a few hours of sweating like crazy the stuff still seemed to be doing it's job and hadn't rubbed off.After a full day of being outside in full sun I can honestly tell you that my neck face arms and legs are not even the least bit burnt. Even with a higher SPF sunscreen like Banana Boat my neck and face would get scorched after a few hours of being in the sun but not with this stuff.The only complaint I have is that is can stain light colored clothing bit in all reality this is a very minor drawback.This product deserves nothing less then five stars for how well it performs it is just amazing and I will not use anything other then this for now on! I believe in the product wholeheartedly.Pros:Goes on smooth and isn't greasy.Works better then any sunscreen I've tried before.Doesn't wear off easily.No perfumes smells or anything to cause irritations to the skin.Cons:Cost but it works better then anything else out there.Can discolor light colored clothing. Awesome sunscreen for us red heads!,Neutral
I like Cotz because it primarily contains two UV-blocking ingredients and not a lot of extra chemicals perfumes or additives. Additionally I'm amazed at how this can be clear - usually titanium ozide or zinc are an opaque white (the kind lifeguards apply to their noses). But this goes on pretty clear. And it's an extremely effective sunblock and seems to last a long time despite sweating (I haven't tried it in water yet).That being said there are a few drawbacks. First it's not really odorless - but it is nearly odorless. I don't really mark them down for that. But do not expect a lotion that smells like baby oil coconut oil or traditional suntan lotion.Second it does go on clear but don't touch your skin with white or light-colored clothing.Third and probably most important titanium dioxide is not completely safe for frequent use. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently categorized titanium dioxide as a possible carcinogen to humans. That being said it appears to cause lung cancer more than anything (when inhaled). Even though urine tests will pop positive for titanium dioxide when applied to the skin the level of carcinogenic properties is unknown for topical applications like this.So my recommendation would be to use it if you have severe skin/burning problems use sparingly on those longs days at the beach but not use too often. Pretty good ...powerful protection despite a few drawbacks,long time
I have used this for alonf time it makes my skin look fresh the wrinkles are better great to use under make up love the fragrance very light scent love the smell.  and I am very sensitive to odors and smells especially perfume so this is great the olay age defying night cream is the same nice smell. I love this cream,Neutral
I love the smell or should I say the absence of that perfume smell in many lotions.  It is light absorbs well and softens skin.  It is a day cream as it says so you'll be disappointed if you expect it to substitute for a night cream.  I love the list of ingredients as well. Wonderful day cream,Neutral
Not only does this product cover flaws % but it doesn't rub off on clothes or run.  I've been using this for years and my makeup kit is never without it. Smooth doesn't smell like perfume and is well made.  My skin is super sensitive and this works well.  Highly recommended. This is the best cover up,Neutral
The REVLON CUTICLE NIPPER is a popularly-priced widely-available useful little implement that helps keep nails and hands well-groomed. Revlon is of course an old and well-established company as cosmetics companies go though I generally avoid their products as they are too highly perfumed for me - no worries about that here with this one.  And yes I know that every professional manicurist uses this sort of implement but I don't know what brand they use probably a professional one. But this one does the job fine.  It has precision crafted blades to trim hangnails and excess cuticles safely and its full jaw will cover a large cuticle area.  It's easy-to-operate spring action mechanism generally gives a clean cut without the need to pull or tug at the skin. And its non-slip grip handles should enable the user to hold and control the implement in either hand and work with accuracy and control.My situation as to hands and nails has been dire for many years.  My hands and nails have been too dry; they have itched cracked etc.  I have scratched.  Whenever I had hangnails or excess cuticle or rough cuticles I have torn at them often drawing blood.  Manicurists have been known to count the number of injured fingers as they worked: only small injuries sure but messy and ugly and sometimes a bit painful.  However recently I seem to have found products that have helped actually lubricate my hands and strengthen my nails and I decided to give these nippers a try on the theory that they would do a cleaner less injurious job on hangnails or rough skin than my pulling or tearing at them.  And they do particularly if I can use them as soon as I notice the problem.  My hands and nails look and feel better than they have for years.  Small victory but fewer blood drops on my pillow cases. They Do a Good Jo,Neutral
It's a great moisturizer. I've used ti for years. I absorbs completely and does not clog pores or cause acne. The scent is not perfumey just smells like what's in it. I only wish they offered a version with spf protection. Seems like a no brainer.Buy it for an indoor moisurizer or for post makeup removal. Wonderful moisturizer,Neutral
I'm on my first bottle of this which I bought because I needed a heat protectant to use with a new curling wand.  I don't usually like add-on hair products because I never want my hair to feel like stuff is on it.  I was pleasantly surprised because if you use a light enough hand in spraying this on it is not in the least bit gunky or sticky.  After my hair is dry I can't tell it is on my hair at all which I love.  The reviewer who complained about it obviously sprayed on way too much of it.  Use a light spray only!It has a lovely smell which is an added plus for me as I find many hair products smell truly sickening.  The scent of this one is not at all overpowering but really nice (like a subtle perfume)  when you put it on and then soon it mostly disappears.  The price is fabulous deals all over the place on it depending on where you buy and I truly doubt that the various salon type brands at quadruple the price are any better.  Only time will tell if this really protects my hair though.  I hope it does.  Since I don't yet know how well it works as a heat shield I only gave it  stars for now. Seems Really Great,Neutral
I'm basically obsessed with this product right now!!! I have used the Chi Iron Guard for the past year but this stuff is MUCH better. The Chi Iron Guard makes my hair sticky and dry. This Tresemme stuff seems so vitamin-enriched it's super lightweight and makes my hair smooth and shiny plus IT SMELLS AMAZING!!!! I want to wear it as perfume. LOL. The Chi Iron Guard doesn't smell good at all. Honestly this stuff hasn't only protected my hair from heat but makes my hair look so much more healthy. I'm so happy I found this!By the way I have wavy fine hair. Hair that curls/frizzes when exposed to humidity or wet. So this definitely works on my type of hair. LOVE,Neutral
This is a nice hand and body lotion and really makes my skin feel soft moist and smooth.  But there are MANY other lotions that will do that.  I bought this because I liked the fragrance.  However unlike most perfumed lotions this one's fragrance disappears almost as soon as you put it on.  VERY expensive for a lotion with no fragrance and a huge disappointment.  Thank heaven there was no shipping charges for this.  Thanks Amazon! Fragrance doesn't last,Neutral
Pros: gentle non-drying non-irritating washes off easily leaves a clean but not perfume smell lives up to it's recommendation; formula is always dependable bar lasts a long timeCons: isn't always easy to find! A bit priceyI haven't always been a bar soap person because too many I've used in the past left dirt or some sort of film behind when you rinse the soap off. Plus other brands of bar soap I've tried were very drying and many of them left my skin feeling way too tight. Basis is the only brand of bar soap I will use because it cleans gently washes off easily and leaves a clean fresh smell on my body. It also is very gentle for dry sensitive Rosacea or problematic types of skin. My Dermatologist recommended Basis to me and it still works better on me than any other bar soap I've ever found. I have tried using moisturizing washes in the past but none of them work as good on me as Basis. I highly recommend trying Basis because it will get your skin clean without over-stripping or causing irritation! Best for us sensitive types,Neutral
I have terribly dry skin due to the winter and EVERY soap both liquid and bar I've tried just makes my skin even more dry but this soap does not it's wonderful and very much worth the price! It rinses clean has no perfumes or harsh chemicals like other soaps have and it feels amazing on your skin and the face wash isn't half bad either. Love this soap,dry skin
My mother was coming for a visit and she does not do well with the average soap. I believe the perfume in the soap is the main problem. She had used Ivory soap for years but one of her doctors had recommended this product and she has been using it ever since. I sent her home with the remaining bars but kept the opened one with me I was very pleased with how it felt on the skin and how it cleaned. I can see why she loves this soap. Very good soap for sensitive skin,sensitive skin
Hand soap cleaning my house my body everything!! I put some in a spray bottle with water and even clean out the toilet with a drop. A little goes a long way the scent is true lavender and not perfume smelling. Love it. Use it for Everything!!,long way
I use this as a pre-poo treatment sometimes leaving on a few hours and sometimes overnight.  I also mix it with my henna when I do a henna dye.  I like that it is a natural product it's good for my hair and not as expensive as some treatments.  Like the smell it is definitely coconutty/lemon but i prefer that to perfumes. Pretty good,Neutral
I have been using this stuff since I was in my teens probably  years or so.  I dated an Indian boy back then and he introduced me to it in an attempt to help me deal with my occasional blemishes and the redness that would not go away for weeks after they had healed.  I did not find that it prevented blemishes at all but it seemed to have a pretty obvious astringent effect closing up my pores pretty effectively.  My face seemed to get less oily on days when I used it so I developed a habit of using it as a primer under my foundation.  It also seemed to temporarily reduce redness.  To be honest though the # reason I continue to buy it  years later is the sandalwood fragrance.  It is *heavenly*.  I wear it as a perfume as much as anything.  It is getting difficult to find the unscented version which I prefer for my face as the sandalwood can be overwhelming on my face but I will probably always keep this around just for the scent.  My daughter has also found that it makes a good oil-inhibiting primer under makeup although she also would like to be able to get the unscented version more reliably.  You can't hardly wear any other fragrance once you have some of this stuff on. Delicious Sandalwood Scent,Neutral
i have thick wavy/curly hair and i use this right when i get out of the shower. it makes my hair a bit curlier without making it crunchy or stiff. it smells awesome and i dont even have to wear perfume when i use it! my only thing is that i didnt like how much you have to apply for it to start working. nice curl enhancer,Neutral
I like the scent well enough.  It smells like something I've had before.  It's a younger smelling perfume and fruity floral to me. Perfume,Neutral
This is my all time fave fragrance..if you love light flora fragrance than this is the perfume for you. It wears well and every time I wear this men go crazy..it's very sweet/floral smelling and lasts all day. Definitely recommend it!! Plus the Amazon price is soo reasonable. refreshing floral scent!,Neutral
This fragrance was not pleasant to me at all. At a first sniff it seems ok but once on it is overwhelming and has no appeal to it. I hear this is the most popular out of the Versace line but I strongly disagree. I rarely give negative reviews on perfumes cause I am a fragranceaholic but this one I left in the store. Negative,Neutral
I love this fragrance. It smells so fresh and beautiful. I first tried this about a year ago when Ulta gave me a / ounce sample and have used it sparingly since then because I didn't wish it to run out. I found Amazon had the best price by far and after going through seethefakes dot blogspot dot com I have determined the  oz bottle bought from Amazon (as the seller not a marketplace seller) is the real deal. Same scent same everything. At the seethefakes blog the most telling difference between this and the fake is the sticker at the bottom and the ridges on the box. That way I knew this was the real deal and it was $ less than a perfume outlet was selling it for. I'm completely happy & will be buying this from Amazon again when I run out.Also this can be used anytime any season but is probably best Spring-Summer daytime. My favorite fragrance!,Neutral
Call me crazy..but this is my favorite all time go to any time favorite perfume..I don't know exactly why either..I get complimented on it when wearing it and its just such a fresh cute (is that even a way to describe a perfume?) scent..I usually buy perfume and when Im out I move on and buy types but I have repurchased this and will continue to do so as long as it is around its on the pricer side but well worth it I try to use it sparingly..best perfume by far that I have come across though although I love other perfumes many for that matter..but I always come back to this no matter what....:) FAVORITE..,Neutral
Light fresh and feminine and very springy.  This perfume wears easily isn't too heavy and as the name implies is something of a sparkling floral.  I find this scent to be very nice but also fairly non-descript.  This is your garden variety light floral perfume.  It's pleasant to wear it will make you smell nice but by no means unusual or unique. Light Airy Pretty,Neutral
I recently just received this as a sample with my Sephora order. I am also very picky with my perfumes. I don't really like all that many.When I opened this one to try it I was pleasantly surprised. It's light and airy and the best part of all is that it lasts! Most perfumes I enjoy tend to wear off after only an hour or so of wear. So far this one's been lasting quite sometime.The notes from Versace state that Bright Crystal is a fresh sensual blend of refreshing chilled yuzu and pomegranate mingled with soothing blossoms of peony magnolia and lotus flower warmed with notes of musk and amber.I don't know about all that but I know it smells wonderful! Delicious smelling,Neutral
A very fresh and light smell! I'm not a fan of light smells but I love this perfume! By far one of my favourites. I highly recommend.I did not purchase this perfume on amazon.com and from seeing all the questionnable reviews from sellers on amazon.com selling knock off perfumes I wouldn't suggest for anyone to purchase perfumes online. Only from a department store/ drug store. Amazing smell!,Neutral
I smelled the Kai oil rollerball in a spa and loved it. I bought the spray perfume since that is what I tend to prefer. I actually did not like the spray as much as the rollerball and I am not sure why. Anyway I bought this lotion to see if I could enhance the spray perfume. It definitely does work to enhance the spray perfume and increase the staying power and I like the perfume more now that I have the matching lotion. As a lotion it does work better than many other scented lotions. It is thicker and kept my hands from feeling dry without feeling greasy.This scent is very floral. If you do not like floral perfumes I don't recommend this. If you tend to like florals (as I do) I recommend this lotion. I think it would be very nice on its own as well - the scent is pleasant and would likely last awhile without the accompanying perfume or rollerball. Nice lotion; I recommend using with the Kai oil rollerball.,Neutral
It was ok seemed a but too scented to me for a face wash. It was a bit to perfumed for something I would use on my face It was ok,Neutral
I use this oil for daily moisturizing and love it not too heavy and the smell is awesome. The smell fades a bit and has a light fragrance. Not too overpowering so that you can wear a perfume or body spray as well. love this oil for dry skin and it smells wonderful !!,dry skin
I've been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years and really like every product of theirs I've tried. I've had the same bottle of this oil for about two years but because you only need a small amount of it each time you use it it's lasted me that long with once-a-week use.I love this oil and adore the brown sugar smell; it's fragrant without being too cloying.  I would use this more frequently but I've found that it doesn't sink in as much as lotion and the scent remains pretty strong throughout the day so I can't use perfume on the days I wear it.I also use it on my legs right after shaving and it doesn't sting or burn.  It moisturizes well and lasts for about ten hours.If you like the smell of sugary goods in your body-care products then I'd definitely recommend it. Delicious smell,Neutral
I already wrote a review about the fragrance itself...sexy subtel seductive very feminine and mature (but not mature like old lady..oohhhhh no!) It's also very versatile it can be worn every day and be appropriate for every setting. But anyway I just wanted to say how great it is that they have this larger bottle.  It's a nice savings compared to buying the roll ons.  I still have a roll on for my purse though.  I'm obsessed with this perfume!  Auric Blends in general have really made some truly delicious scents and such high quality oils for so little money! Does it get much better than that? I think not. Beautiful,Neutral
As I usually ignore negative ratings I ordered this larger size of Egyptian Goddess perfume oil and am very pleased with my purchase.I find the larger size to have the same strength as the roll on oils I have ordered from different vendors.The bottle I received was NOT cut with filler oil and smells great.Egyptian Goddess is not supposed to hit you over the head.  It is supposed to be a subtle but long lasting fragrance whichmy bottle received is.Glad to have the larger size handy for refill my smaller roll ons when I use them up.Highly recommend the large bottle. GREAT FRAGRANCE AND GREAT BARGAIN!,Neutral
I absolutely love this perfume oil! I've bought other brands of Egyptian Musk because I love the scent but none of them come close to this one. I love the fact that the oil is a bit thicker so it seems to have staying power. I love that I can at any point get a small whiff of it and it has such a calming effect on me. This is good stuff and I'll continue to buy this brand instead of the others. I also love that I get so many compliments from wearing it. Funny thing is that it's usually at the gym after I've been sweating that I get these compliments. So it's nice to think that it actually continues to work even when I've been sweating. Love it! You don't have to be a goddess to smell like one!,Neutral
The Egyptian Goddess perfume oil smells amazing in the bottle. It is so disappointing that Auric makes it so weak. It is only detectable when you are applying and the scent is gone in a couple minutes. Unfortunately I would not purchase again because it is so diluted. Why put oil on yourself with little scent. The whole idea with fragrance is that it is fragrant. Pump up the scent to oil ratio and I will buy it again! Make it stronger,Neutral
This is a bottle of oil. There is absolutely *NO* perfume in it nor does it contain anything to cause it to have a scent. I cannot believe I bought this after reading reviews stating exactly that. But I thought with my hound-dog sense of smell I'll be able to enjoy this 'fine perfume.' No such thing. There is *NO* smell here AT ALL. This one is going back. Do NOT buy. A bottle of oil,Neutral
This nice thick soap smells coconut-y and mildly sweet -- and the smell gives off a sense of thickness and creaminess.I like using this soap for my whole body and my face not just to get clean but also as shaving cream especially for my legs. It's almost like this soap can be used like lotion kind of. What I do in order to get a really smooth feel on my legs after shaving for example is really rub in the soap on my skin then shave then rinse off but not too thoroughly or with luke-warm water that way you don't end up with like alligator scaly skin once you towel off. After using this soap shaving lightly rinsing toweling off and not using anything else (like lotion) on my legs they feel really soft and smooth almost like I did use lotion on the shaved areas.I love the ingredients list as none of them seem to be harmful or carcinogenic nor does the smell give me a headache and I'm very sensitive to perfumes in products.As far as complaints they're pretty minor. This one might not even be a complaint but sometimes when I shave I freak out a bit because some of the little orange-brown-ish flakes come from the soap and at first I'm like oh my god is that a scab?! but no it's just from the soap as you wear it down from use :PThe biggest complaint but nothing really serious sort of complaint I guess is price since I'm currently reviewing on Amazon. It looks like the normal price for this is like $? I know that you can buy this in bulk from amazon and that's probably what you should do. Otherwise look elsewhere like vitacost to get them individually if you don't feel like paying $ or more. then again amazon gives you free shipping... up to you I guess.Great soap though. Great moisturizing soap I use it like shaving cream.,Neutral
The scent of this goat milk soap includes chai herbs and shea butter infused with traditional goat milk. This may make the scent more perfumed or feminine than anticipated but it is a light comforting scent. The soap has hetbs in it so it is textured. Other goat milk options are products like Canus but they lack the shea butter that allows this product to be ultra soothing. It softens skin nicely. If the idea of the textured herbed soap leaves you leary try the body wash. I love this product line and also this scent and find I get many compliments as well as skin benefits. The lotion is also fantastic! Comforting Scent and Great Product Line,great product
One star for the natural ingredients; one star for the awesome smell.  I feel like this soap leaves a film on my skin and didn't do anything to help with my sensitive dry skin.  I still had to lather on lotion once I bathed just like with other body soaps and washes.  I also noticed soap scum in my tub was quicker to build up with this soap than others.  I wish the company would make a perfume or body spray with the smell of this soap.  I'd buy the scent in a heartbeat! Awesome scent but leaves film on skin.,dry skin
i first received this perfume about  years ago as a present and found it to be a semi sweetfeminine but still light and refreshing scent.The purchase here on Amazon was no disappointment.Packaging was perfectshipping fast and the cost very reasonable. the sunthe moonand the stars,Neutral
I ordered this perfume after reading the reviews on Amazon. I'm not understanding how people find this perfume attractive at all. No one in my household likes it either. It smells worst than dog poo to me and honestly...no one could even PAY me to wear this. Worst part- not returnable to Amazon. Something must be wrong with me....,Neutral
This is the original perfume and not a knockoff. It came packed just like in the department store and smelled perfect! The bonus..... Paying half the price free shipping and no sales tax! &#;Pleased Customer&#;,Neutral
I used to wear this perfume in my early 's & it was my absolutely FAV back then! The stores here stopped selling it & when I found it here on Amazon I was SOOOO THRILLED! It was delivered very quickly packaged safely & I can not beat the price ANYWHERE! =)I have ordered  bottles of perfume in the last  months & will continue to order more. GREAT for gifts as well! =) SO HAPPY TO HAVE MY PERFUME AGAIN! =),Neutral
I used to have an imposter of this perfume back in the early 's and I loved it. Then it suddenly dissapeared. I love it because it is a strong scent that last all day. Every time I like a perfume it seems likeit gets disscontinued. One of my favorites of the 's & 's was Scoundrel by Coty or Revlon and I think Joan Collins used to advertise it? Please let me know if you can get this fragrance? Old  Time Favorite,Neutral
I wore this perfume about  years ago and had actually forgotten all about until I saw it listed on Amazon.  The scent is very light but has great staying power.  Most things fade on me but this one remains throughout the day.  It's described as a floral scent but on me I can hint more of the sandalwood and amber.  I don't particularly like floral scents but this one is so unique and subtle.  I was so excited that I could get the full-size . oz bottle for around $ with Prime shipping!  And the bottle is beautiful; unlike anything else out right now. Elegant sophisticated and beautiful,Neutral
I love Sun Moon Star perfume.  I've worn nothing but this perfume since I was like !  I was so happy to find it on Amazon since I can no longer find any reasonable prices locally.  Why pay $ at the Mall?I would describe the scent but I just don't think it's possible.  Everyone loves this perfume.  I've had to write down the name for other people more times than I can count. Great Price,Neutral
I *finally* laid my hands on a sample vial of SMS after resisting a blind buy for the last few months. Boy am I glad I resisted. This floral is definitely not for me.On me the opening is very synthetic. At first the aldehydes reek havoc then the jasmine gets cloying. A fruit-floral-woods progression is absent. I faintly smell a powdery wonderfulness and occasionally get visions of dancing daffodils but it's not enough for me to give SMS another chance even if it smells great on paper.I just don't have the chemistry required for Sophia Grojsman's blends (the perfume's designer). If you're like that too you might just save yourself some trouble and cross SMS off your test list. Crossed off my list!,Neutral
love it!!! only  stars because it doesn't last. the only drawback!develops gradually into sexy yummy smoldering enigma.this is a grown-up not cupcake-teen perfume. vanilla perfume,Neutral
I love the scent of this. It has a natural lemon scent not chemically like many lemon scented perfumes. There is also a secondary smell that is sweet and a little floral but very light. I get head aches from most perfumes but thankfully not from this one. You don't have to worry about possibly putting too much on because the scent isn't over powering. You know like when you walk through the grocery store and can smell the woman's (sometimes it's a man!) perfume from the next aisle. This is a very nice clean smell. Eau de Parfum Lemon Verben,Neutral
Light fresh clean lemony but not overbearing. It is nothing like Love's Lemon Spray. Little goes a long way. This is just what I was looking for all of these years. I am very sensitive to cologne perfume essential oils. I can't keep count of how many I have tried that irritate my senses. This is perfect. I hope they don't stop making it now that I have found it. This scent is probably fine for guys too. It isn't sweet or heavy. super happy,long way
You only need a small amount. It cleanses without drying. It smells fresh (not like perfume). It does not irritate the skin or leave it prone to acne. Great cleanser. I'm hooked. AWESOME cleanser,Neutral
Smells great! Packaging was very good and bottle came without any leaks :) looks great in my collection of perfume.The scent on me is a nice light sweet but flirty scent. I believe any age can wear this of course it smells different on different ppl but this is a must yummy!,Neutral
I'm rewriting my review because initially I didn't like this very much. I felt like the guava was too strong and dominated the fragrance. I didn't get much chocolate which was disappointing.But after using this a few more times I fell in love with it. And this happened with some other perfumes as well. I don't know if my chemistry changes on a frequent basis or if I just get used to the perfume? Maybe a combination of both. Whatever happened I love this now!!! It's so soft and sweet and just a pleasant smell.I do detect a little chocolate and vanilla and lots of guava but now I love the blending of the three. Definitely happy with my blind purchase. It's great!,Neutral
Many of the notes in this perfume are really pretty- I like the fruity and floral notes. The overall effect of them is fresh and feminine. The one thing I'm not happy with is the vanilla note- it doesn't blend well with the others so I go back and forth between smelling fruity/floral and smelling vanilla and it's heavy and powdery on me. For me the vanilla ruined what would have otherwise been a very nice perfume. Didn't like the vanill,Neutral
I ordered this bottle AGES ago and have not even gotten halfway through it.  When I smelled this in the store I absolutely LOVED the scent and could not wait to order it.  When I received it the perfume was pink not purple and the scent was not AT ALL what I remembered.  I did not like it at all.  I thought maybe it was me so I just let it sit.  The other day I came across it in the store again and decided to smell the tester.  I was DEFINITELY hoodwinked.  The perfume in the store instantly reminded me of the scent I loved.  Will not reorder from this seller. Not the real thing.,Neutral
I got a sample of this at Sephora.  I LOVED the smell.  I wanted something more mature but wasn't too strong or old grandma.  I LOVE This.  It smells amazing. It comes in a super cute heart shaped bottle with a cute crown at the top.  If you like the smell you should buy this. Love this perfume.  By far my favorite perfume,favorite perfume
I ordered this product for my daughters friend on Christmas. It is a little pricey but she absolutley loves this fragerance. Being a man I must admit many womens perfumes smell bad to me but this one smelled very nice Nice,Neutral
You can definitely smell the vanilla and chocolate. But in a great way! It's not too heavy and not too light this fragrance lasts roughly - hours on me. For any of you who have allergies or are very sensitive to scents my father has the scent of a bloodhound. Every time I spray perfume on me he complains about it being strong. I sprayed this perfume on one day (he did not know I had bought perfume) he asked me what the nice scent was. I told him that it was my perfume and he looked at me shocked and said great choice. I recommend this perfume to whomever loves a feminine scent. I'm  years old also. Yummy!,Neutral
When I saw the review that said this perfume is better than Thierry Mugler's Angel I was so excited because it's my favorite scent. I thought I would LOVE Vera Wang's Princess. Well I spray it on and for  seconds I smell a baby powder type scent and then absolutely nothing. Uuggh!! I was thankful that I only paid $. including shipping for an unopened box from Ebay.Update: The key to hating this fragrance was the fact that I got a fake on ebay. I purchased the rollerball of Vera Wang Princess and it smells great! I was disappointed,Neutral
I think I thought this smelt a bit off when I first got it really alcoholly but then I realized the perfume I had just finished had been around a while and as things age/breakdown the smell changes. Smells as it should now and matched the roller ball perfume I also have.  No complaints. I would recommend :) Perfume as expected...,Neutral
Curious was not one of my most favorite perfumes ever but In Control surprised me! Similar looking bottle and other stuff but completely different smell. This is mature yummy and just plain old delicious. I love it! It's what I wear weekend! It's a scent that says I Want To Have Fun! Fun!!,Neutral
I love all the fragrances in the curious collection this one smells amazing and is a great night time perfume! I was so happy to find this on amazon I've been searching for it for years. Now thanks to amazon I own all of Britney's fragrances! I'm very happy with this purchase and am even happier with how quickly they delivered it to me! Great fragrance!,Neutral
I love this perfume so much is smells very sexy and delicious ! This smells a lot like Britney spears other perfume fantasy which is a great thing but this one is more tangy. I love this perfume and I will buy this again amd again! One thing I'm mad about is that it did not come with the little in control chain on the perfume bottle. It's just a plain bottle with nothing else which is odd when the picture has more items on it.. Also I ordered this perfume from a different seller and it did have the chain on it. Smells FANTASTIC!,Neutral
I'm not much of a perfume person.  They are usually too floral or too potent for my liking.  Body sprays are easier for me to deal with.  But I LOVE this perfume.  In Control is my absolute favorite perfume!  I'm not sure how to describe it but it's not too potent or too floral for my liking.  I know that when I'm able to I will definitely be buying more! My favorite!,favorite perfume
When you buy this perfume for your girlfriend don't tell her it was under  dollars!  I don't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume.  Yeah like it really smells better just because it's more expensive.  Anyway Sarah Jessica Parker perfume has a really nice scent that you'll want to smell over and over.  It's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on it either.  Add just a touch for proper use. smells good,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume I cannot believe its so cheap on amazon considering it cost about $ in department stores. I am very happy with this product and have no complaints. We'll worth it. Love it,favorite perfume
I was warned by friends before that this smelled really bad well I sprayed my whole hand with it anyway. The bottle is pretty the gray ribbon tester is pretty Sarah is pretty too but the scent is horrendous.It smells like some lovely old moth eatten socks under dust bunny attack.Im a fan of Sarah Jessica but the perfume is totally off for me. I love floral and woody tones but this just smells like dirt. Blech,Neutral
I always wanted too buy this perfume I am so happy that I bought this perfume it smell  so nice. perfume,Neutral
Nice perfume for every day. I really love this  perfume. I heard so much about it  for years that I have to order it. Really is LOVELY. clean and classi,Neutral
If you are someone who LOVES a truly feminine fragrance...this is IT! I specially  selected this perfume and I will be wearing happily on my wedding day in  weeks! I want to have the perfect scent that will always remind me of the day I get married! I was reading Tuberose and Vanilla aromas have very relaxing and calming properties which will be perfect for me as a nervous bride. This perfume also carries notes of Creme Brulee which happens to be my fiance's favorite dessert! I was wearing a little bit of the fragrance yesterday and he couldn't stop clinging to me...he just loves it!When I inhaled this perfume's sweet creamy soft scent it was true love at first sniff! There is something exotic and just so pretty about it. It is definitely a perfect scent for all seasons. My husband to be also loves Juicy cologne and wears Dirty English by Juicy for Men. I love the way my Juicy Couture and his Dirty English cologne smell together. I think those  Juicy fragrances were created to compliment one another. I think any woman could appreciate this perfume. It is just so universally pleasing to everyone and fit for all ages. % GIRL,little bit
I do judge a perfume by its packaging. I went to a local retail store desperately in need of some odor other than mine with internal parameters that the product could not be produced by adult celebrities or teen celebrities and that the packaging did not look like it was geared toward teens teen celebrities or adults posing as teen celebrities. This one seemed to fit my liking without busting my husband's wallet (I purchased a mini). Other stuff see below:Good stuff:-It is a parfum which is the longest lasting of the liquids in the perfume world.-Bottles are exquisite.-Price effective if you do not use it as Jean Nate (no accent key) Splash.Bad stuff:-Top note reminds me of Christian Dior's Poison. ' anyone? (I know it was introduced in ' but it hit teen culture in my neck of the woods in '.)-Other notes are totally girly-girl floral in general; I cannot pinpoint notes. Watch out!-Headache producer. No-ture No-ture,Neutral
my girlfriends are the best. i was hinting over and over about how much i love the scent of this perfume. and now i received as a present for my birthday. its the sexiest scent ever. something sparkly like champagne with some floral notes and vanilla. i so love this scent. the best,Neutral
I wanted to love this perfume. I absolutely salivated over it for ages wondering if I should indulge and buy some and if I should away the pangs of guilt I felt for spending so much money on myself (I'm a mom you know how THAT is) and yet...I don't know...what smelled FABULOUS on someone else what smelled FABULOUS in the bottle being sprayed in the magazine just on basically ANYONE ELSE did NOT smell FABULOUS on me. It made me smell like an old fruit vendor with a diabetic issue. I kid you NOT. It wasn't pleasant. It was..well..think of those brown bananas you forgot about in the fruit bowl until they became alcoholics and you had to turn them out to the street. Got it? Yeah. Not for me. So my advice is to TRY IT ON BEFORE YOU BUY IT. My other piece of advice is to BUY FROM AMAZON. I DID NOT BUY MINE FROM AMAZON AND PAID WAY TOO MUCH. I bought mine from an upscale-ish dept store (starts with a K) and it was almost fifty bucks for . oz...there ya go. If you like it BUY IT HERE. On the upside of things Juicy Couture makes another fragrance called believe it or not Juicy Couture and it's AMAZING. It smells heavenly...even on old diabetic fruit vendors. WARNING:  Smells Different on Different People!,Neutral
great perfume even greater price this is a  in my book smells wonderful company shipped fast whats to say except i'll buy it again love it,Neutral
My wife loves Juicy Couture products for her and for the baby. A lot of her friends seem to feel the same way. So when it came to Valentines day a little ( ounce) bottle of Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum seemed appropriate. It was. The perfume supplies a nice light and very feminine fragrance. It's not overpowering and that's the way I prefer perfumes. Just a light delicate enhancement will do fine. Plus the price was quite reasonable for a big-name brand.Gary Peterson Just Right.,Neutral
I do not like this perfume at all. To me it smells like something an old woman would wear. Doesn't surprise me since there are none of the typical young notes in here at all (especially vanilla). Or if there are I sure as heck can't smell them! All the friends I've asked have agreed with me that this is an old woman-smelling perfume. I sold mine on ebay. Smells like an old woman,Neutral
I purchased this based on reviews and.....my husband is wild over this perfumethat's all I need to say. It is a must have. A must have,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume ever. I love the way it smells and you only need two squirts. I always get compliments on it and everyone always asks what it is. Favorite Perfume,favorite perfume
This is a great warm weather scent. Light flowery fruity but without being too sweet; it's just great! This is the perfect go-to spritz for a lovely aura of flowers. Highly recommended even for the most jaded of noses.  It IS strong though--a little goes a very long way--so spray in the air walk through and it'll be just enough for people to say What's that wonderful fragrance?  Is it your perfume? Delightful fragrance!,Neutral
I use to like this perfume it does not stay on as long as I would like. It is more softer than I expected. It seemed like when someone bought me a tester of Juicy from the department store the scent was stronger. I don't know. I have stronger perfumes like Sean Paul Madame Blueberry Brittand Alien. So this just did not do for me. I know mix this with some other perfume someone gave me called Precious or Lovely mixed together it smells great. I probably won't get this perfume again. I like some kick to my perfumes not overbearing but something... Light Softer Perfume=),Neutral
I have always thought the decanter holding the precious liquid was pretty but I was unprepared how gorgeous and mesmerizing this scent was going to be. From the moment I rubbed the tester from a magazine my nose was in love. Five minutes later I ordered a big bottle off the internet and it arrived a few days ago and I still cannot part with the scent. I even spray it on to go to bed the sheer fact how warm and softly scented my sheets are in the morning makes it hard to get up to work. This scent melts into the skin the musky cr&egrave;me brulee base is topped with juicy crimson watermelon glowing mandarin apples fresh aquatic hyacinth royal smelling lily and precious woods that give it a soft and spun like quality to the scent. I often find myself inhaling the aroma through the day catching whiffs of my warm body and they escape up and away.This fragrance is truly delectable with a softly scented melange of fruit and musky vanillas that really smells delicious and not like a fruit cake that so often is the result of perfumers going on a sugar coated overload. The scent is almost an aphrodisiac a meteor shower raining down the inky sky with fluorescent flavors. This is my favorite new fragrance along with Estee Lauder's Beyond Paradise and I wear it from morning after my shower until the stars spear the sky and I lull myself to sleep. It's breathtakingly beautiful and so fragrant that my nose might never get over it no wonder this perfume is so hard to find!Notes: Watermelon Mandarin Pink Passion Fruit Marigold Green Apple Water Hyacinth Crushed Leaves Tuberose Absolute Wild Rose Princess Lily Tuberose Caramel Creme Brulee Vanilla Precious Woods Patchouli.- Kasia S.

This perfume makes me sooo happy. I use this for work and I love it. It smells so pretty and I feel amazing when I wear it. And it lasts all day. Its perfect! Makes me happy!!,Neutral
Everything of Juicy Coutures that I've ever seen and bought is stunning and this is no exception.  I love fragrances and I love Juicy and this is now a new favourite of mine.It's beautiful and exotic and different to other perfumes out there.  You can smell watermelon vanilla tuberose and like an apple smell throughout it to name a few.  It's soft and yet has a lasting effect.  Sometimes perfume fades too quickly but this I find lasts.  It's a flirty and fun fragrance that would suit women of all ages.  It's so devine and not too overpowering.  I hope you get a chance to smell it because you may fall in love with it too. As stunning as their jewelry and bags etc ;-),Neutral
I have been wearing this perfume for a long time now and I still cannot get enough of it.. and neither can my husband! Men absolutely love this fragrance! It is so light pretty sweet airy crisp - just pure perfection! Not to mention the bottle is gorgeous too. I have the newest Juicy perfume too Viva La Juicy but I like the original the best. If you are trying to decide between original and the new one pick the original - you will not be disappointed! This is a scent that any woman can wear. It doesn't matter how young or old you are it will work on anyone. Love love love this stuff! One of the best of all time!,long time
I constantly get comments about how good I smell and people asking what scent I'm wearing.  I don't wear any other perfume anymore. My favorite scent.,Neutral
This perfume smells a bit different from the bottle I got from Juicy when it is first sprayed but as soon as it dries they both smell the same Great,Neutral
This perfume smells sooo wonderful! I don't usually wear perfume because it's either too heavy or sweet but this one is great! I got a sample from Sephora and was instantly hooked I couldn't stop smelling my wrist. My husband who hates most perfumes loves it too. I immediately went out and bought it. I smell gardenia and it's a very girly sensual smell. Ladies if you want men to follow you around this is the one to do it! This one is a winner!,Neutral
It smells like white shoulders an old ladies perfume. Not to impressed and I will not buy a again especially for the price. smells like old lady perfume.,Neutral
Due to my allergies this is the only perfume I can wear that does not make me sneeze constantly.  Everywhere I go people are always asking me what I am wearing. My Fave Perfume,Neutral
I ordered  of the Juicy COuture samples for stocking stuffers...they were $...ok nothing hardly. Well when I looked at my statement I was charged $. for expedited shipping!!!! for a $ bottle of sample perfume...im sick about it and wasnt allowed to change it. so I got screwed out my money save your money ship it standard. DONT PAY FOR EXPEDITED SHIPPING!,Neutral
This was for a gift and really liked the aroma is very good strong but good the maxima of the stars at the perfume is original I recommend it to all enterprising men what I liked most is to have it  :D very good,Neutral
I bought the parfum spray and body cream on the recommendation of a friend.  The notes are nothing like what I usually choose (I'm in the chypre family usually) and I knew this but I thought I'd try something a little different.  Well I love it but my husband hates it on me.  Maybe it's just too different for him from what he's used to smelling on me.  So I wear it when we're not going to be together.  Most perfumes don't last well on me and this one is no exception.  When I first spray it on though it smells fruity and happy and makes me smile.  You can't ask much more of a perfume than making you smile :) Sort of a fun little perfume,Neutral
Bright tropical fruit and smooth caramel. This is a fun youthful fragrance that is more than just your usual fruity celebrity perfume. I adore it! Delicious!,Neutral
this perfume just smells so fun and flirty. Theres no possible way I can spray too much because its not overpowering or harshly sweet! I don't wear it everyday but most all my nights out about town I wear it and the smell itself makes me and my bf happy :) my favorite!,Neutral
I'm so glad I was able to find this perfume online because it was one of my favorites but it's not sold in stores anymore. It smells AMAZING and I never have to work about someone wearing the same perfume as me. I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE all the time. Love This Scent,Neutral
Beautiful fragrance reminds me just a little of the old version of Liz Claiborne.  I usually don't like buying perfume without trying it first but I decided to take a chance on this one and am very glad that I did. It's also very long lasting I put a little on yesterday and can still smell it today.  To me the scent is a sweet fruity with a hint of floral Love it.,Neutral
This is a very fruity sweet youthful perfume that isn't flowery or floral at all. It's light and it's opening smells like a burst of tropical fruit and a bit of sparkly freshness. It smells like a mix of mango pineapple melon maybe apple or honeysuckle? It dries off to a soft sweet musk that is not masculine smelling. Lasting power seems decent on my skin maybe  hours tops. The scent reminds me a lot of an Escada scent which usually tend to be fruity and sweet. Bottle is very pretty! Looks great in a lit display or under a lamp. I would recommend this perfume for women under . Definitely a fun summery scent not mature or heavy at all. Not my favorite perfume in the world but I do like it. refreshing tropical and fruity!,Neutral
This perfume has a slight fruity slight musk scent.  It smells really good!  The scent is lasting.  I just got it in the mail today and it's evening now and it still leaves a scent and it's not nauseating or sweet.  I like this better than Live which I got early this week! MMMM Fruityluscious!,Neutral
Not overpowering but fresh. It reminds me Tommy Girl fragance. I really like this perfume. Very satisfaced with my purchase. Very fresh!,Neutral
It's not that the smell is terrible because it's not ... but this perfume just doesn't do it for me. It's not a smell that strikes me or anyone around me for that matter. I've used other perfumes where people would actually ask what perfume I was wearing or tell me that I smelled nice. No one has even complimented this smell. Just okay,Neutral
Well I was pleasantly surprised when I actually enjoyed this scent as I've detested most of J. Lo's scents. Live Luxe is the first follow-up to Live. It is a fruity floral created by perfumer Claudette Belnavis. The notes include pear peach melon apple muguet amethyst freesia honeysuckle diamond musk amber vanilla and sandalwood.Personally I find Live Luxe zesty light and clean. It smells very feminine and carefree. When I wear Live Luxe it actually relaxes me. Live Luxe isn't the usual fragrance that I'm drawn to but I like this one (not love). Live Luxe is also good for layering with CSP's Vanille Canelle. The Vanille Canelle gives it a stronger base with a bit more depth.I wouldn't repurchase this as it's not in the fragrance family that I'm drawn to but it's worth a try! Better than I expected...,Neutral
This has a very sharp fruit scent like grapefruit to it.  I don't care for it although at first I liked it but now I hate it!  The dry down is what irks me way too tangy.  I loooooovvvvve the Live perfume but then something was tweeked to make this awful stuff!  I put my small bottle away and it will stay there in the closet forvever! Very Fruity,Neutral
This is my all time favorite shampoo and conditioner. It smells good but not from chemical perfume. I've been buying it at Amazon for ages because it is a great price here. I often use it on my Maltese who has hair to the floor and it is excellent for her too. Totally sleek.,Neutral
Many would think someone was insane for spending this much on a body wash/scrub.  Although after trying it I think the price justifies the product.  I have really never felt more refreshed and cleaner than I did after using this product.  From the moment I apply it to my skin I notice the great scent which is not overpowering and perfumey like so many other men's body washes.  The sea salt helps exfoliate the skin and make it softer.  That is what I really enjoy.  It's not always easy in the Winter when dry skin can be the norm.  This is the best body wash I have ever tried and I am sure most would feel the same.  The price may be high but I think in this case it's justified. Refreshingly worth it,dry skin
I adore Tree Hut's products and I wanted to love this one- but I just couldn't bring myself to use it. Don't get me wrong the consistency is true to the 'butter' name- smooth it on and it seems to melt onto the skin making it feel quenched without leaving residue(Like my old real shea butter mixture)I am NOT sensitive to perfumes I usually love almost everything I smell. Even then this Brazilian Nut makes me wrinkle my nose. I wouldn't dare walk around smelling like this. It's like rotten vanilla as someone mentioned.The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of not just the texture but after about an hour of wearing it when the scent calms down it smells great- but it's not something everyone will smell on you unless you're in close contact. I personally don't want to reek for the first hour. I purchased Coconut Lime (I have the scrub so I know I love that scent) and I wish I hadn't taken the chance on this scent. Love the texture but the initial scent is awful.,Neutral
Be it a man or a woman people will fall in love with you while you wear this.  It smells so good and the scent lasts pretty much all day since body butter lasts longer than perfumes and sprays. Best Smell - Love Love Love,Neutral
I'm ordering more of this original shea body butter because it is the best I've tried in decades. It has a pleasant scent that doesn't compete with a favorite perfume. It does need to be rubbed in well to avoid any chance of transference to clothing.The shea butter used is certified organic shea butter and is listed the fourth ingredient right after water and two other ingredients that add moisture and elevate the product's skin penetration.I apologize for the chemistry jargon but I was curious about the ingredients it contains after reading a previous review about the quality of this product.  The short version: it works lasts a long time and you don't need a lot to moisturize your skin. A moisturizer that lasts,long time
Smells a bit like a mix of chocolate and butter.  Not what I expected but the smell does not last all day if you use a second scent (like perfume or a body spray).  The body butter is thick creamy (not hard like traditional pure shea butter) and non-oily though I do not recommend using this on your face.  This along with some jojoba oil is enough to keep my legs feeling and looking fabulous.  I use a lot of cream - times a day all over my body I went through one jar in about  weeks. Wonderful and light,Neutral
My local Target stopped selling this and I could only find the new &#;soft&#; formula which is useless for me. This is the only product I've found that is not oily like Eucerin but still thick enough for dry rough skin on my feet and hands. Truth be told I even use what's left on my hands and run it through my hair. It makes it settle down and leaves it shiny all day. The smell is a great clean scent not perfumey. THE BEST,Neutral
I ordered eight different scents of Pacifica's soap. Only the French Lillac comes as a white creamy bar with studs of dried flowers and herbs While the others are an amber translucent tone studded with dried herbsflowersand fruit peels.In their dry state out of the shower the California Star Jasmine smelled like synthetic jasmine. But once in the bath it transformed into a clean gorgeous fresh jasmine scent.If you're a discreet scent type these soaps will not linger as a strong overwhelming smell after you're out of the shower and about your day. But it breaks the monotony of the work week.I encountered ample suds. Most all-natural products don't sud as much as drugstore Dove or Yardley. It's a very high quality all natural vegan product for a decent price. L'occitane soap bars of the same size are $ a pop! Sabon soaps aren't that great. Soaps sold through Anthropologie for the same size and price range dry out after a few weeks and look like sheets of paper soap. I also love Biggs and Featherbelle which is a small all-natural soap company (with sisters and their families helping).The best soap I've had is from La Pasioneria an Argentinian highly perfumed highly creamy high en yod soap company out of Mendoza. But they don't export to the US.And that's all I have used for the past -years--soaps picked up from travels by the luggage full.So comparing Pacifica soaps to other soaps I've tried in the past -years in the same gifting soap/occasional treat soap category rather than generic Dove/Ivory from a value for money angle I recommend this as part of a gift or a mini-treat for yourself.For a long time I was turned off by Pacifica's glycerine looking translucent blocks. I wanted a change and a good review here of the Spanish Amber soap piqued my curiosity.Now I'm converted!If you buy directly from them their customer service is small scale really nice and very helpful.The level of complex scents and quality oils and natural dried herbs/spices would cost alot more.I've been cutting up different scented bars into mini-hotel bar sizes--the bars are super easy to slice because they're vegetable glycerine based.I assume I can get more than a month's use out of the giant bar of soap as well.Here is the run down:Waikiki Pikake (hawaiian jasmine): blend of hawaiian jasmine with sandalwood. (sweet but not cloying because of balancing in of sandalwood smells like pikake indeed but not artificial) This is more like taking a shower in hawaiian flower farm in one of those backyard showers outdoorsCalifornia Star jasmine: california star jasmine and driftwood notes. This smelled more green and less natural than pikake in dry form but opened up to a good non-synthetic jasmine smell in hot waterfrench lilac: french lilac heliotrope and nectarine. It smells like the lilac bushes at full bloom during springtime at the Lilac garden at Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. No artificial synthetic smell.Tahitian gardenia: tahitian gardenia jasmine orange flower ylang ylang. It smells like gardenias and just lush green--like what the color green would smell like if it had a scent..and sweetness. In the shower the gardenia opens up once you start soaping.sandalwood: woodsy scents with top notes of tangerine and sweet orange. I definitely smell just the citrus scents from the bar without immersing it in water. Since the soaps and lotions all have complex top notes heart notes and dry downs like with perfumes--I assume the sandalwood will open up in the shower when the soap is wetTibetan temple: vetiver root patchouli ginger orange rinds. (i also smelled cardamom in there. It smells like chai tea or the spices in an indian kulfi/ice cream mixed with a musky incense note like vetiver)Persian rose: smelled like citronella. As with the lotion the rose scent opens up once you introduce soap to warm water.spanish amber: labdanum sandalwood  geranium elemi (smells real warmvelvety musky and leathery..like a man's after shave) the musky scent really opens up in the bath..really good for winter day. A treat for morning showers and long baths,long time
Used the entire bottle saw no difference at all.It is gentle on your skin doesn't burn which is a good thing.However like all of L'Oreal products it has a strong perfume smell that I hate.Won't buy again. It's ok,Neutral
Lets get to the point this anti-wrinkle eye cream is CHEAP and that is why most of you gals purchased it. Department store wrinkle & firming creams are way-way over-priced and you all are aware of that fact.  I've paid $. for less than one oz. for a high-priced over the top name BRAND and all your complaints for this L'Oeal product are most definitely inter-twined with the ideal over-priced high-end Department Store product.  Get my point girls?  They are all the same but this L'Oreal Anti-wrinkle firming moisturizer eye cream is actually non-greasy soothing comfortable no perfumed aroma and CHEAP....... My bag are still there too.  It don't get rid of the wrinkles believe me but it is better than using nothing.  It truly feels good after being on for / hours.  Worth giving it a shot. Let's face it eye creams are all the same !!!!!,Neutral
I did not use this product for more than  days...each time forcing myself.  I don't know if it would work.  I am  years old.  But the smell reminded me of an  year old grandmother...sorry grandma....who doused herself with floral scent.  And the texture was waxy and thick.  My hubby could smell me a mile away.  Yuk! Had to explain to friends that it wasn't perfume. The smell!,Neutral
I have very sensitive skin and I'm not really sure how I like this product yet. It is very perfume-y and every time I apply it I sort of feel like my skin is reacting to it a tiny bit. I haven't really broken out or anything from it but it doesn't seem very hypo allergenic. I'm going to keep giving it a try but right now I'm not too sure I like it. Unsure..,sensitive skin
This is one of my favorite perfume that I wear all the time because it smells so good on me. The scent is very light and not over powering. It is a mix of apple lavender and amber. The scent last for a good eight hours and you will get alot of compliments every time you wear this perfume. I recommend this perfume for anybody who wants to smell lovely and don't want a fragrant that people can smell before you reach and stay behind after you already left. Light lovely fragrant,favorite perfume
My favorite perfumes are Dior Pure Poison Valentina by Valentino and Chanel No .  However they are a little pricey for everyday wear.  Lovely has become my go-to everyday perfume. It is never overpowering and reminds me of luxury soap; fresh floral feminine and soft.  The scent lasts the best part of the day and I get a ton of compliments on it.  The smaller bottle . oz is perfect for carryon luggage and the scent is versatile enough for most occasions.  I highly recommend Lovely.I have also tried SJP's Endless but I did not care for it at all.  I'm sticking with Lovely. Soft feminine lovely,Neutral
I love this perfume one of my favorites. Smells so clean feminine and the bottle is pretty. I never get tired of this one. Good price good packaging very pleased with my purchase. This is one of my favorites,Neutral
I have always loved Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely. There are loads of celebrity perfumes out there; but I think this is one of the best. A well-balanced concoction of Lavender and patchouli-- Lovely is simply lovely. It's not too strong neither too mild had a distinct smell. I always feel content and happy when I put on Lovely.It is also worth money-wise. At Amazon you can find it within - dollars; for me it's better than many expensive perfumes. I would say that it's excellent for casual wear.This particular bottle came in excellent condition and on time. Thumbs up for the seller :) Simply Lovely!,Neutral
I think . oz is too much now. I'm definitely over this perfume at this point and probably won't get it again in the near future. But this isn't to say that it is not a lovely perfume because it honestly is and many people would agree. Good enough,Neutral
THAT IS A COMPLIMENT!NOT EVERYONE LIKES EDT OR PERFUMES THAT SMELL LIKE FOOD.SOME MAY NOT FIND THIS SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH EVEN IF THEY DO.WELL I LIKE IT AND APPARENTLY THOSE WHO HAVE SMELLED THIS ON ME LIKE IT TOO.I HAVE BEEN ASKED WHAT I AM WEARING.....WHAT IS THAT YUMMY SCENT EXACTLY ?I GIVE THEM THE NAME AND THEN ADD&#; IT PROBABLY REMINDS YOU OF COTTON CANDY&#; AND IT REGISTERS WITH THEM THAT YES THAT IS THE SCENT THAT WAS COMING TO MIND.I THINK THIS IS A CASUAL  PLAYFUL AND SEXY SCENT.  BUT IF YOU GET COMPLIMENTED ENOUGH YOU WILL WANT TO WEAR IT FOR ALL TYPES OF OCCASIONS :-) YOU SMELL LIKE A WALKING COTTON CANDY STICK AND,Neutral
I ABSOLUTELY love this spray. It was everything I'd hoped it would be. The bottle is huge for an AMAZING price. You can count on the fact that when I run low on my current bottle of this I will certainly be purchasing another. Perfume,Neutral
I like this but I don't love it it is defiantly ok and if you like sweet smelling perfumes than this may be for you.  I purchased this after being on a Comptoir Sud vanilla etc perfume kick and I defiantly prefer that brand to this.  THis is a decent back-up but I just didn't love it the way that others do. Like,Neutral
I absolutely love this type of scent. It's sweet and innocent but has a caramel/vanilla note to it that keeps it from being too childish of a scent. When I first sprayed this on I thought it was slightly overwhelming but I do not fault the perfume for that - I think I sprayed it on a little heavy at first. I love the fragrance even more as it has a few minutes to mellow and adapt to my skin. It's so delicious smelling I am so glad I bought it. Mellows a little as it dries,Neutral
I've been buying Mistral's Wild Blackberry soap for years and it was my absolute favorite smell but the last two batches I got smelled different. At first I thought I was going crazy but then I ordered two more bars and it's definitely a different fragrance. It's way more perfume-y and heavy on floral notes less on fruity and musky notes. I'm so devastated because it used to smell heavenly and powdery and musky now it smells like fuddy duddy perfume. It is crazy to think why anyone would fool with perfection. I emailed Mistral to confirm the change but they haven't written back. Mistral changed the Wild Blackberry scent!,Neutral
I smell This Perfume in Sears by mistake my daughter spray on my hand cost is high in sears. I remember name and took picture of this perfume packing. I ordered from Amazon it's good deal quick shipment but not free (I ordered with other stuffs to fulfills amazon free shipping policy).I recommended this perfume for others but remember this smell is stays few hours not over day or over night (you have to spray twice in day if you want that stay on your body at least for hrs then spray twice a day).Smell is what I want and I will sure buy again if I need good smell perfume.Remember this perfume smell is similar to OBSESSION by Calvin Klein EDT SPRAY for MEN ASIN: BHZQWFU so I have  similar fragrance's now.-HP Good Smell but not long Lasting,Neutral
I love this perfume and I always get compliments when I wear it. To me it smells like blueberries with a faint low tone of musk. It is a very alluring sent that is great for evenign wear. love this perfume,Neutral
I love the scent however- it wears off quickly. I would be totally in love with this perfume it would last beyond  minutes. awesome smell but doesn't last long,Neutral
i have been okay with these various perfumes that Britney hascreated. but you have to just use a little cause some of perfumescan be strong.Not Britneys. great,Neutral
I like this scent it's a little on the fruity/flowery side.  Not as nice as the regular Fantasy. Nice Perfume,Neutral
**Edit //**This is a nice fragrance when you put it on. Smells like blueberries and grapes as well as a few other fruits I cannot quite put my finger on. Then it mellows down to the mid notes which is somewhat reminiscent of passion fruit but a little spicier. Then after about two hours it mellows down to the base notes which smells like fruit but a cheap off brand scent underneath. Kind of plastic-like. I love the first two effects but the third has me feeling like i put something on from a Barbie play costume set. Unfortunately I had to drop it three points for that reason because the base note is what you get left with and I am not much of a fan of it. Maybe this is better for teens but I am  and looking for something a little more adult without going to something in left field like Opium and White Diamonds (smells great but is too heavy for my age group). If you are like me and want something a smidgen more sophisticated maybe skip this one and keep looking. I also ordered about three other brands of perfume to test Escada Magnetism Paris Hilton Heiress and Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise. I will be reviewing when I try probably this week!What's in this Fragrance?Top Notes:Black Cherry Framboise PlumMiddle Notes:Night Blooming Orchid Iris FreesiaBase Notes:Amber Musk Vanilla**Original Review**I just received this fragrance today and I had to put some on my wrists immediately to see what it smelled like. Awesome! It started out smelling like blueberry's and I have to say that it's nice. I got the . ounce because I am trying to find my new signature fragrance so I don't want a big bottle of something I may not like since I have never smelled it before. I am pleased to say that this is a rather large bottle and I love the scent. It has not had time to really break down into any midtones yet but so far I am quite pleased and I keep sniffing my wrist. I recommend this if you like light somewhat sweet fruity fragrances. And this is far from bug spray as one reviewer stated. I say get the small bottle and try it! It's Good Then...,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume and I was super excited that I got it on Amazon for this price!! It had the softest sweetest smell ever!! love it,favorite perfume
I just received the item today. When I opened the box the first thing I notice is spills of the perfume inside the box. I don't want my perfume to be wasted. I am so disappointed!!!!!!! I love the smell n the bottle is so beautiful. Overall I am not really happy with my purchase. Perfume spills inside the box!!!!,Neutral
I'm collecting all of Britney spears perfumes I just got midnight fantasy it smells so nice! It smells like berries but not too much it's a nice blend I absolutely love this scent ! SO GOOD!,Neutral
This is my favorite of all the Britney spears perfumes.  It has a very sweet smell.  People will compliment you all day while wearing this scent and guys LOVE it!!  I have purchased extra bottles so that I never run out.  this price is FANTASTIC!! You will pay at least twice this amount at a retail store.  Don't hesitate BUY NOW!!! My FAVORITE,Neutral
I love the smell of this perfume but ordered this for my sister as a gift. It is a nice size and arrived within a week. Great smell!,Neutral
I love this perfume it's a big size bottle . oz and it was on sale between $-$.  It smells like blueberriesblack cherriesand maybe grapes. Midnight Fantasy By Britney Spears,Neutral
I have read someone said it's too sweet and i could not agree more. My first impression was it smells like vitamins? Vitamin c.. I dont know. I love sweet scents but this one is too much for me.But who knows i might like this eventually.I might be just overwhelmed since i got all my  perfumes today. :)) Too sweet,Neutral
Wow! I smelled a sample of this and knew I had to get a bottle. This smells so good! It has a fruity but not overly sweet smell to it. I think someone mentioned that it smells like grapes it does kinda smell like grapes but not in a overly obvious way. Such a nice balance of fruity notes and lasts a while. My husband loves the smell of it on me and he's pretty picky about perfumes. This scent is easy to wear day or night. This stuff smells amazing!,Neutral
I Like this Parfume spray from Britney and I am glad I bought it but I Like her other one better...They do last and I do get people asking me what I am wearing..They are both clean smells and will buy again..Another thing they are not expensiveI pay alot for perfume and these are just nice to wear to work... Nice smell to it..,Neutral
I purchased this with a pack of four other Britney Spears perfumes a few years ago and I have to say this one is complete crap compared to Fantasy. There's something in the scent that I don't particularly like. After browsing through the other reviews on this page I realized it was grape! I hate the artificial scent/flavor of grape and I'm not entirely sure if that's what the perfume is supposed to smell like but it's the best excuse I can think of for why I dislike it so much. I've tried wearing it a few times and by the end of the day I can't stand it! I will give it this though; I've never smelled anything quite like it. I can see why other people might like it I just hate something particular about it. Yuck,Neutral
This serum has anti aging ingredients that would cost you more with expensive companies! It's a lightweight serum that benefits the skin. No heavy perfumes. Very organic! I have been using this product for years. You can purchase this product at a great price! I recommend MyChelle Firming Serum... Great serum!,Neutral
Vanilla has been one of my favorite signature scents since I was a teenager (I am in my late s now).  I absolutely love this (and for the record I've always been a huge fan of musks as well).  Unlike others I don't find this very musky - the vanilla stands out for me.  My favorite vanilla perfume was a vanilla scent made by Victoria's Secret long ago (and as far as I can tell it was discontinued years and years ago - not the same vanilla they currently sell).  This perfume is the closest I've come to replicating it.It's sweet charming and youthful.  If you're a vanilla fan you will undoubtedly love this. A near perfect vanill,Neutral
I love Lavanila products but this scent is just not for me. It must be my body chemistry. This perfume smells so musky on me. I prefer the other scents in this line. All of the Lavanila perfumes last all day ! Not for me,Neutral
Best smell ever. Love love love. Some Vanilla perfumes smell like children or flowers or goth chicks. Not this. Feminine subtle awesome. Smells like Love and Cupcakes,Neutral
I agree with other reviewers that if you love vanilla fragrances you can't get better than this. LaVanilla is a beautiful sweet pure vanilla fragrance. Unfortunately though after about  minutes you are left with a whole lot of nothing as the scent completely disappears. For such an expensive perfume I expected more. I would not suggest wasting your money on this. Fades away super fast,Neutral
Wow this fragrance is so warm and cozy. Great to wear at home or on any casual days or even just to snuggle with someone. I normally love aquatic or very clean fragrance but this is really really good!It's sweet without seeming childish and lingers lightly. It's a deep (almost masculine but not quite) vanilla fragarence. If you are sensitive to scents or are around others who are this is a non offensive scent Deep vanilla perfume,Neutral
I tried this because it was on sale and I will buy it again. It has a limited firming effect kind of like Jergens tho that is also available with light tanning. I like the scent better than Jergens' tho it is not really a light scent. It's noticeable but as far as these firming moisturizers go this is my favorite scent perfumey and not the least bit medicinal. For the firming part none of them that I have tried will do away with flab. They firm up the skin tone a little and will soften and reduce the look of cellulite e.g. or tiny wrinkles from dryness or age. I have not tried the higher end products but I doubt they are much better. This one worked fairly quickly only a few days to see results so that was nice too. Good product. Very good Wins Best Scent in Category,Neutral
I love a clean scent on me always. This product has a great cotton candy scent but does not linger. Hair perfume,Neutral
I love pretty much every scent in the Pink Sugar line. This is no different. Smells just like the perfume which I get compliments on ALL the time. Love Pink Sugar.,Neutral
Pink Sugar is a lovely sweet cotton Candy vanilla soft fluffy cloud of a scent.  The packaging is VERY cute and the product line is so extensive!  I especially love the Perfume however the Deodorant is REALLY nice as well.  The hair perfume was a MUST try and I was NOT disappointed.  This is a wonderful way to wear Pink Sugar!  It also has ingredients to help with shine without adding greasiness.  I love spraying this in my hair even when I am not wearing my Pink Sugar Perfume.  *I also own the body souffl&eacute; and the body lotion.  Would love to try the body oil!  If you love Pink Sugar you NEED this product!!! Oh MY SWEET HAIR I love this!,Neutral
This perfume almost always gets me compliments. I use the perfume and the hair perfume. I have been using it for about  years. It is my HG perfume. It smells like cotton candy sugar cookies and vanilla. People can smell it wherever I go. I have to admit it's powerful and some people don't like powerful perfumes just a warning. I have never been insulted though. People say things like I normally don't like perfume you smell amazing. or perfume normally gives me a headache but yours doesn't! It's great! or most common You smell delicious! Have you been baking? I like powerful perfume and I am usually disappointed when my perfume does not last. This last and is powerful. I almost always use the hair perfume even with other scents I try. The perfume I use probably about / days a week. I don't wear it to interviews though. If you like vanilla cotton candy or sugar cookies you'll enjoy this. If you don't like strong perfumes this is not for you. I use it almost every day and a .oz of the EDT typically last me  and a half years. The hair perfume I go through more quickly because I have long hair. It's GREAT! Sweet and Strong,Neutral
Pink sugar is pink sugar------however the hair perfume does not last that long. I feel like I have to use the spray often. I recommend using it along with the perfume as well if you want the scent to linger. Scent doesnt last very long,Neutral
I love this product. The scent is so feminine and fun. I only wash my hair every other day so on day  it's great to be able to &#;freshen up&#;. I have the perfume as well. I was afraid that at  I was too old for this scent but I honestly can't stand any scents that are maybe a bit more &#;mature&#;. What the heck! I like what I like! Love Love Love,Neutral
What's wrong with having hair that smells as delicious as a cupcake?  Absolutely nothing!!  This stuff is amazing.  If you love Pink Sugar then you need this hair perfume.  It smells just like the perfume only a little lighter and the oil makes my hair so soft and shiny. Also lasts a long time for me.  I can smell it all day long especially when my hair blows in the wind.  If you think that the alcohol in perfumes damages your hair or if you just want more Pink Sugar products to get hooked on buy this hair perfume now! You won't regret it. MAKES MY HAIR OH SO TASTY!!!!,long time
I love this product! I hate when you use a nice shampoo nice conditioner and then you have to add other different products on your hair to style you don't even know what is going to end up smelling. Once I used a product that smelled so terrible on my hair. I wish I had this.Yesterday had a test done and they didn't want me to use no lotions no perfume no deodorant nothing like that from my neck down. I remember I had this and I used it on my hair. All the girls there were like... You you smell so good we told you no perfumes. I'm like its my hair. They didn't know about this ether. They loved it. I have long hair  healthy hair. It is important to me that it smells like it looks.  these are there little touches that makes us more memorable than others. The smell lasts. Loved it.,Neutral
This hair perfume is perfect for summer!  I love the smell it smells just like the perfume like cotton candy!  I originally bought it since I have to dye my hair every month and the hair perfume gets rid of the hair dye smell!  I love it! perfect for summer!,Neutral
I originally ordered this because I thought I could use it for &#;no poo&#; since I'd miss having scented hair. I can't vouch for if it will leave any buildup over time on &#;no poo&#; hair as I had to cave and shampoo after  weeks. I didn't &#;clarify&#; first before starting and experienced waxy hair...but that's another story.ANYWAY I have only had this spray for a day but I already looove it. It made my hair smell like vanilla & cotton candy and also seemed to smooth it down and enhance the shine. I have very thick hair so I put about eight sprays in from roots to tips (lifted my hair in back and got the underneath layers and all) and I still smell it the morning after. It smells better than any shampoo scent I've ever used and that includes the high-end stuff. In fact I'm glad I'm not in public because I keep grabbing my hair and smelling it. I will definitely be buying another bottle when this one runs out but it seems like it will last for awhile. I like it when companies give you enough that you don't have to re-order every time you turn around. Also the bottle is cute for what it's worth and I was even sent a coupon for my next purchase.I will update this review if I decide to do the &#;no poo&#; thing again in combination with the hair perfume. Hopefully it will just wash out with warm water and be a viable option for scenting hair. Exactly what I hoped for!,Neutral
Aquolina Pink Sugar Hair Perfume ml Cute and fun leaves my hair smelling nice and fresh with a yummy sent that makes my boyfriend smell deep and say ur hair smell so.. good SCORE...... haha ^.^ this is a clear fine mist that has a light oil to it and you don't need much to do the trick and sweet smell lasts all day ^.~ It's an awesome bang for ur buck. Will I buy this again Yessssss yes I will ^.^ So sassy ^.~,Neutral
I like the concept of a hair perfume. My hair can only tolerate being washed every other day but I still want fresh hair and thought this item would work. I'm sorry to say that it's too sweet for me. I tried many tricks to tone down the scent from spraying into my hands and then applying to hair to blotting with a towel after  spritzing my hair. That sickening sweet smell was still there. I gave it to my sister who seems to like it so I have not wasted money. I'm glad it worked for others but it was just not for me.P.S. I tried to edit my review and change the number of stars from  to  but it won't allow me. Too sweet,Neutral
I just love this candy smell. Not too kiddish and not over powering. I use it daily and like the perfume but the body wash is just so-so. Love the smell,Neutral
If you like Pink Sugar you'll definitely love the hair perfume! It doesn't overpower you but because it's on your hair you will smell it throughout the day. I don't notice as much of the initial pepper top note as with the EDT; it seems to go straight to the fresh sweetness of the EDT drydown. It adds a touch of shine gives you some UV protection makes combing a breeze-- This is simply a must-have product for Pink Sugar fans. If you like Pink Sugar you'll definitely love the hair perfume!,Neutral
I was really hoping this scent would be true to it's name and that it would smell of redcurrant and basil.  Wearing it I smell neither one of those scents (both of which I love); it just smells generically perfumey on me.  I love the idea of a redcurrant/basil scent but this is not it.  Your mileage may vary of course but I highly recommend a test run before buying. Didn't smell like redcurrant and basil to me,Neutral
I rarely use perfume because I don't like heavy scents. But I like to bathe/shower each day and smell good. So I'm more into using spa luxury bathhouse or handmade soaps shampoos body lotions body washes shower gels spa products that make me feel and smell good - they end up being my fragrances that make me smell good throughout the day. But during the special occasions when I would use a fragrance Fresh's Mangosteen perfume ranks up there as one of my favorites. It's not too overpowering and when I smell the scent I'm transported into a good mood. I'm so happy that this fragrance exists. Out of all the exotic fruits I've tasted on this planet and in my past travels Mangosteen is my absolute favorite fruit of all time. I was first introduced to Mangosteen fruit when I was a kid traveling on vacation to Thailand. My parents are from Thailand and the Mangosteen fruit reminds me of my Thai and Asian heritage. The Mangosteen fragrance reminds me of the time I went with my sister mother and Thai relatives on a boat in the Thai floating market to buy Mangosteen fruit. It reminds me of the time when my relatives would gather at my uncle's home in Bangkok and there would be a bowl of Mangosteen fruit awaiting. Mangosteen is my favorite fruit in the world and a lot of times I find myself missing that fruit. It's hard to come by this fruit in the United States and I was born raised and still living in the United States. This is a happy memories fragrance for me. My favorite fruit captured in a perfume bottle. Mangosteen is a unique and wonderful fruit and this Mangosteen perfume is unique and wonderful as well. Great Perfume,Neutral
This product does feel great on your skin. However I really enjoy perfumed shower gels etc and didn't like the smell of this. Not pretty or perfumy at all - gave it away. Feels good - but the scent?,Neutral
This is the stuff in the old Loving Care coloring. I am highly sensitive to perfumed products but it doesn't seem to bother me. They no longer make Loving Care but I remembered how great this stuff was. My hair gets really dry. So I searched and this appears to be the same stuff. Just a little bit made a huge difference. I read some complaints on the size of the package for the price. It says use a &#;quarter-sized&#; amount and I did. There is plenty in there for weeks and weeks of weekly conditioning. Very pleased. The smell is stronger than the one in the box but not so bad that I cannot tolerate it. Fantastic for me,little bit
Definitely a keepsake for your bag/purse. It is the perfect size easy to use and wont leak. You can just put it in your bag and be on the go. I mostly use this product to store my favorite perfume. Efficient,favorite perfume
Stage makeup and body paint are both part of my craft and easily wiped away with Albolene. It is equally effective removing everyday makeup. Over time I have even noticed that the skin around my eyes and mouth has remained soft and smooth because of the mineral oil ingredient. I often leave a dab on my lips before going to bed at night to keep them moisturized.Albolene is reasonably priced for the effectiveness and quantity which lasts a couple of months at least with daily use. There are no perfumes or ingredients that would irritate most sensitive skin (like mine) and the moisture properties are a great bonus. I highly recommend it! Only one of the best makeup removers on the market,sensitive skin
I use Essential Oils for the Hair on my face!  I apply it to my face (under my moisturizer) at night and in the morning the overall condition of my skin is better than when I use the moisturizer alone.  Much better.  The results are significant even versus other natural oils like argan and emu.  When I told my mother to try it on her face she thought I was crazy; but after she tried it she was asking me where she could buy it.I love the scent of it too...the hint of coconut makes me feel like I'm on my way to the beach!Since it's so difficult to find the list of ingredients online (even at Avlon's website) I'm listing them here for you:Sunflower seed oil Peanut oil Castor oil Coconut oil Jojoba oil Sesame oil Aloe Vera oil Almond oil Olive oil Perfume Propylparaben BHA. I use it on my face!,Neutral
Makes your skin soft and not greasy or oily. No perfume and works great on husbands dry skin and elbows. Medline Tememdy Skin Repair,dry skin
You can make your own in-shower moisturizer with hair conditioner and a LITTLE BIT of high quality oil like almond jojoba shea or coconut.  Baby oil would work on a budget.  If using shea or coconut oil it might be best to warm the conditioner and oil a bit to liquefy the oil for mixing.  Mix very well and poor in a bottle.I would be careful about the amount of oil so your shower isn't greasy and use a separate towel for your hair so it doesn't get oily.  I would also consider using an all-natural mild scented conditioner so your skin doesn't itch from perfumes.This might be a great way to use up left over conditioner or those tubes collected from hair dye boxes.  Just test it out on your skin first before mixing up the whole bottle. Body lotion might work too.This Olay product has great reviews around the Net and is a great convenience so I thought I'd share my idea for a homemade version. You can make your own,Neutral
I received a sample of this product when I stayed at a spa and loved it.  When my husband saw it in the bathroom he wanted to try it too.  (My husband is a very manly man)  One of his guy friends told him about how well it works without leaving the skin sticky or smelling like a girl.  Olay might be surpsised to find out they have a lot of guys using this and recommending it.I like it because it does a great job of moisturizing doesn't conflict with my perfume and it seems to be faster than applying lotion after my shower.I've had a hard time finding it at my local stores.  After my sample ran out I went to three or four before I finally located it at Albertson's.  I'm glad to know I can also purchase it from Amazon. Great Product,great product
I have been using Suave product for a while. Suave body wash lotion shampoo and conditioner. I like them all. Inexpensive and effective. I used to really like this creamy body lotion. It had Cocoa Butter and Shea and it was great. But they have changed the formula for this lotion by adding less cocoa butter and shea. These two integral items are now near the bottom of the ingredient's list.The result is that the lotion is not as creamy doesn't last as long and repeated applications are required. It smells a lot like perfume and not a whole lot like cocoa butter and shea. Very dissapointed. New Formula not as good,Neutral
Small inexpensive way to try perfumes.  This was ok but I didn't love it.  Not too strong just not what i was looking for good,Neutral
Has a sweet floral scent with little ambiguity. Pretty direct and to the point. The scent would probably best suit a mature women. The scent does last a long time and a little goes a long way. So I am rating it  stars because it is a well made perfume even though it is too sweet for my taste. Sweet Floral and long lasting,long way
This is a high quality product for dry skin. It is not overly perfumed and not offensive but does not smell bad at all. bath and beauty,dry skin
This scent is very lovely it is light and breezy with floral undertones and a slight fruitiness. Perfect to wear everyday as it is not overpowering at all. These perfume oils last all day! I was so impressed the first day I wore it and when I got home from work that evening the lovely scent was still on my wrists and neck. Make sure to roll these over your pulse points (wrists neck etc!). This is my new favorite! Smells LOVEly to me!!!,Neutral
This scent is absolutely delicious!  Auric Blends is my new favorite brand all of their perfume oils are amazing and they mix beautifully to make your own signature scent but they also work wonders all on their own.  This one is a white amber musk combination its fresh and has soft floral notes of Egyptian Goddess (my # fave) and also slightly spicy but sweet base notes of sandalwood.  It's worn well in the summer because your body heat changes it quite a bit to make a lusciously sweet and sexy truly unique fragrance. yummy,Neutral
ThisOne Love - Auric Blends Perfume Oil stinks like cherry juice cherry flavor gum chew cherry flavor lollipop don't know how to explain this cherry fruit flavor.. but terrible smell stinks.... ignore to buy this One Love - Auric Blends Perfume Oil waste of money...

I usually wear strong citrus perfumes but now that it's autumn I wanted something softer. I smelled this at a local store and bought it right away. One Love is sweet happy and comforting like a warm hug! Mmmmm...,Neutral
My skin tends to be very very dry...especially my feet and ankles.  This stuff has been great.  I love that it has no scent and that it really moisturizes.  No matter how dry my skin is...especially my feet...this does the trick. It is ideal to lotion right out of the shower but for me sometimes that just doesn't happen and with this I am okay if I have to wait.  The pump is handy its a lot cheaper here on Amazon than at my local spot which charges $ dollars and that is after I have driven  minutes to the only store that has it.  I have now converted my teens into using it.  They ran out of their heavily perfumed stuff and after using this decided that they liked it.  Its on the thicker side  but spreads pretty easily. Even if I wait hours to lotion--still does the trick,dry skin
I normally don't buy into the hype of purchasing shampoo and conditioner's like this but after my hairdresser used this on me I fell in love. Goodbye to my $ bottles of fruity shampoo and conditioner's!Usually the cheaper shampoo/conditioners leave my hair feeling very oily and heavy by the end of the night (I shower in the morning) but this one kept my hair clean all day and night! The scent of both is actually what drove me to finally buying this before I walked out of the place. They don't smell overly floral but in my opinion does smell a bit more masculine than most might prefer. Personally I hate smelling like a rose bush and loathe perfumes on or around me as well so this was a welcome change.Word of advice check your local beauty supply stores and even SuperCuts for this. You can actually go in and smell it before you buy it if you're afraid of what some of the more negative reviewers have said about the scent. I paid $ for the set but came here to see if amazon had it for less. Smells Great!,Neutral
Personally I like scented moisturizers - example KAI.  This is more for the working man with rough hands chapped etc.  The price is good but remember it is basicly a cheap moisturizer.  I keep mine near the computer and use it for elbows hand cream and after showers when I am staying in for the evening.  You don't even know you have it on.  Men should like this stuff.  Give me aroma scent and perfume. NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT - just okay,Neutral
I don't use this makeup remover on my face because of the heavy perfume but it is *fantastic* as a brush and sponge cleaner!  It even removed stains from long-wearing foundations.  Too bad Estee Lauder discontinued it.  Figures. Off-label use,Neutral
i love this conditioner but it's a bit pricey.i wish they made this into a perfume because it smells so good and its moisturuizing and leaves my hair soft and if when i sit under the dryer it makes my hair fluffy.great conditioner will probably repurchase when it goes on sale or something amazing smell,Neutral
I've been using this since high school but it was discontinued in my country so I came here. Trust me when I say this is A DREAM for an acne-prone teenager on a budget! (At my shops it cost around $ - this is even better!)I've heard complaints about it feeling greasy and cakey - trust me when I say a foundation brush makes ALL the difference and a little bit goes a looooong way; I could spin a jar out for six months wearing it  days a week once I got a brush. It's very heavy coverage as well you probably won't need concealer even if you have serious scarring or rosacea. Make sure to set it with a setting powder (not a pigmented translucent powder - most of Covergirl's foundations go orangey if you use those) otherwise it will feel greasey and run. It's also not exactly the best in hot weather - even with a good primer it has a tendency to start sliding especially if it's humid. (In hot/humid weather I'd recommend the TruBlend Liquid foundation instead.)It is a mousse formulation so it's also good for very dry skin as it won't dry you out.The only thing is that the smell might put some off - I find it kind of sickly and I try not to take any notice of it. And if you have sensitive skin this might not be for you - I've not heard of anyone reacting but I guess the perfume could trigger a reaction in some people.If you're looking for a mousse foundation get this. Covergirl has made the perfect mousse formula - not cakey won't dry up and definitely matte. One of the best for its price but I hate the smell,little bit
This bottle is teeny and kind of expensive but that is my ONLY complaint. This small vial contains what I believe to be the most Divine and Delicious perfume in the world! My husband loves it and I get compliments on it all the time when I wear it out! I feel the perfume oil really lasts on my skin and it is super portable. It is not a cloying or overpowering white floral. It almost has a water-y note to it which keeps it smelling clean. I am very happy with my purchase. I wish it wasn't so pricey but I believe you pay for it's quality and it is so worth it! This fragrance is unique and fabulous! Great things come in small packages!,Neutral
First of all I'd never purchase this Kai Perfume Oil again.  The Kai Bath Wash has more lasting aroma than this O-I-L.  Total waste of money.  I put it on my wrist to test it while in the house it failed the test; actually it lasted for approximately  hrs. continually fading away to NADA.  Think it is better to buy a good eua de parfum and forget this oil thingy. N-O-T  W-O-R-T-H  T-H-E  M-O-N-E-Y,Neutral
This Kai perfume oil is amazing!  Not only does it smell amazing it stays all day. It's the perfect size to fit in my purse. I will be ordering this over and over again! My favorite!,Neutral
This body wash makes a mild lather and I can even use it for shaving. I like to use it on a nylon scrub puff and I find I don't have to use a moisturizing lotion after I shower or bathe but it doesn't feel oily or greasy. The gel is rather thick so it sits on the puff very well. It is a bit better in the shower than the tub seems to leave a bit of a residue if you bathe. The scent is mild like oatmeal or oatmeal cookies.I have allergies to a lot of things sensitivity to most fragrances especially strong perfumey ones and bar soap leaves a residue (we have hard water.) This is a nice mild body wash and leaves my skin very soft.One of the ingredients in fact the major ingredient is sodium laureth sulfate which is a detergent somewhat less strong than sodium lauryl sulfate and there is some feeling that shampoos and gels should be sulfate-free but it is a good lathering detergent and seems to be mild enough. Good wash for sensitive skin,sensitive skin
For a long time I have been using Lubiderm with SPF on my hands and chest.  I don't like to use my expensive skin products on these areas because the costs add up quickly.The problem with Lubriderm is that it contains fragrance.  I was hoping this Aveeno would be even more gentle and mild since it doesn't contain perfume.  Not so.  For  days in a row I wore this on my chest and hands and suffered horrible watery eyes and runny nose.  I'm not sure quite what to do.  I might just have to use face products on my chest and hands.  How frustrating. don't use if you're prone to allergies!!,long time
This lotion does what it says.  It's really really moisturizing and soothing for dry winter skin.  I've got a few dry patches that only Aveeno seems to be able to sort out.  It is absolutely unscented as well.  I don't tend to like unscented lotions so I add some perfume oil to mine and it still works really well.  This is absolutely essential for me in the winter. Really moisturizes,Neutral
Your skin will appreciate this lovely drink of moisture in the form of this astounding body wash. Leaves skin soft smooth silky hydrated and loved all while washing away dead skin and dirt!!I found this wash works best if I use it in my last few minutes of my shower. That way all the goodness doesn't come off completely. i really love that there's no smell to this wash. I find that works better for me because I love to wear perfume that I don't want to mix fragrances with. An excellent everyday wash.Pros:HydratingNO smell (so a great product if you get irritated by fragrances or you want to wear a perfume)Creamy lather rinses away cleanlyGreat for itchy dry unloved skinCons:I need more..... Feeling a little parched??,great product
I read some great reviews for the Aveeno body wash and body lotion so I decided to try both of them. I use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal when I take my shower. It is like a cleanser that leaves my skin soft without the feeling of a film or an oil. After the shower I follow up with this lotion.This lotion makes me feel moisturized. It blends into the skin quickly and easily and you can tell when the product has blended into your skin--you don't have to go on rubbing for ages. It doesn't really have much of a smell although sometimes I will get a whiff and it has kind of an odd scent but by the time you rub it in there really isn't a smell that I am aware of. This is great because if you wear perfume you don't have to worry about fragrances clashing. If you are like me and avoid perfumes this is great because perfumey lotions make my nose itch and then I start sneezing.This lotion is not like any other lotion I have tried. It does not make me feel greasy like some lotions. The consistency does not feel watery so that while I am putting it on it feels like slightly thickened water and when I am done putting it on I know have to put on two more layers of lotion to get a decent layer of moisture on my skin. Unlike other lotions my skin does not dry out and look dried out a few hours after putting it on. Unlike other lotions this one is not overbearingly thick requiring extra muscles to spread the lotion and rub it in.Basically when you are done it feels like your skin like you aren't wearing anything like the way your skin is meant to feel rather than feeling like your skin is covered with layers of a moisturizing product. My favorite lotion--unlike any other,Neutral
This lotion totally absorbs into the skin - NO greasy feel...absolutely none - zero!  Super light weight.  It is not only unscented - but doesn't have any fragrance at all which is fantastic - it doesnt even smell like lotion so you can then wear perfume without any clash of scents.  Leaves my skin smooth and super soft.  On a - scale...this lotion gets an . Absolute Best Lotion By Far,Neutral
best everyday lotion.really does work if you use consistently. i like how it' is pretty much unscented so it won't clash with perfume if i choose to use it duh,Neutral
I read reviews but no one seemed to mention fragrance so I took a chance.  I was actually looking for something I'd had before .. a lovely almond-scented almond oil that I used to use. . . but I can't remember the manufacturer's name!However unfortunately for me this oil has no fragrance. .. .Then I stopped and thought. . hmm. maybe that's not a bad thing. .I can use it when I'm using perfume elsewhere so there's no clash.  It does seem to rub into the skin nicely and doesn't leave a greasy after-film. ..  The weather here isn't dry enough for me to judge its effectiveness .. but I like it ok so far. .. I gave it two stars for not having fragrance. . and for not SAYING so in its description.But it's great for people who want it unscented. No fragrance at all.  works ok though,Neutral
This did nothing for my acne except make my skin smell like I put liquid perfume on it. This product is so heavily scented it makes me sick. It also makes my skin itch and I KNOW it's because of the fragrance. I don't get why this is so highly rated. It also broke me out. Never again. Horrendous smell,Neutral
This is a great acne lotion. It has % salicylic acid...some lotions have only % or even .%. This lotion has a very nice texture it almost feels like a primer after it dries. Best of all it has a very light pleasant scent unlike most Neutrogena products that have a heavy perfume. Excellent product!,Neutral
First off I don't buy cheap perfume- it's gives me migranes. But I loved Paris's original scent so I went ahead and ordered this one. And after the first application I couldn't stop smelling my wrists! It just smells delicious! Thank you Amazon! Think I'm in love!,Neutral
I got my little sister this perfume and she could not be more excited! It has an amazing smell and package Awesome perfume,Neutral
This is one of my favorite Perfume spray and it was at good price this item is not strong it have a soft smell that every female would love.... prefect,favorite perfume
The fragrance is light without being too overbearing though can get overbearing if too much is spritzed. I am getting hints of honeysuckle and this is a nice scent to add to any perfume. Honeysuckle is a fragrance I would actually use in the summer but this fragrance makes it okay for colder weather as well. This perfume is not overly musky which can be irritating if too strong. I am glad I got this and will make sure to try more of her fragrances!What's in this Fragrance?Top Notes:Passion Fruit Orange Peach Granita Champagne MimosaMiddle Notes:Star Jasmine Tiare Flower Ylang-Ylang Honeysuckle Dewberry Blossom GrenadineBase Notes:Violet Leaf Vetiver Tonka Blonde Woods A-Mazing Scent!,Neutral
I never smelled this perfume before i bought it. I read the description that amazon provided of what's the certain smells that are in the perfume and i saw some that i liked so i ordered it. I absolutely love this perfume it smells awesome!!! I'm so greatful that amazon provides the description of the items that they are selling. I wear this perfume often and it drives my husband crazy. It smells really really good!! awesome!!!,Neutral
You can wear this everyday on any occassion. It's really young and classy. It's sweet juicy with a hint of flowers..more like sweet roses and juicy candy. Really pretty everyday perfume,Neutral

I've worn this perfume for years - ever since it first came out. While I'm not a Paris Hilton fan this is by far my absolute favorite perfume ever. I get so many compliments on it and it lasts for a while. You don't have to spray a lot either which is nice. It just has a wonderfully different floral/airy scent. Hard to describe really it's similar to the original Paris Hilton perfume but better. I'd highly recommend it. You'll fall in love with it and never want to wear anything else. My absolute favorite perfume,favorite perfume
Years ago my sister got this perfume on her birthday and i totally used it all up. she was pissed. soo finally I'm going to buy her this perfume again for Christmas and it still smells amazing lol its awesome :),Neutral
I love most things that are vanilla scented but this is so sweet smelling - the vanilla vague smells more floral to me - it's not at all what I expected. Smells more like cheap perfume and I doubt I will ever use it - Sweet tooth,Neutral
This is a very luxurious perfumed talc.  Makes you feel like a queen.  Beautiful scent.  Therefore I would highly recommend purchasing this product.  DAME HILDA CHOICE,Neutral
Yardley of London English Lavender Body Powders is a must. Talcum powder is so hard to find these days. I was amazed to find English Lavender by Yardley of London Perfumed Talc.

I have fine C waves and have tried out a lot of hair oils and products in the past that have ended up being too heavy and that have weighed down my hair.  I decided to try this camellia oil since I had read such great things about it and am so happy I did!  I've been using it for about five weeks now and love it.Unlike other oils this one really is so nice and light -- and yet using it leaves my hair so soft and helps cut down on frizz.  I use it two ways:  I either apply it to my ends when my hair is wet from the shower or I apply it to the ends and over frizzy bits when my hair is dry.The dispenser only lets you dispense a few drops at a time but that's really all you need.I knew that this was fragrance-free and usually buy products with light fragrances since I'm a smell junkie but I'm still super pleased with this formulation of camellia oil and the lack of fragrance means that it plays nicely with perfume.Great great product! Wonderful for fine hair!,great product
I have tried a large number of moisturizers because I have dry skin.  I like putting the moisturizer on before I go to bed don't like strong smells as they distract me and keep me awake.Hempz is perfect. It has a light pleasant smell that does not overwhelm. The label describes the perfume as cucumber and jasmine and I can detect that in a very mild way. It is not greasy at all and has a very nice texture - easy to spread.  My most problematic area used to be my heels. They had cracked skin and hurt.  But not any more! I use Hempz on my heels after each shower and now my heels are soft and smooth and no cracked skin.I like:) Moisturizes very well) Wonderful scent pleasant and very light) Not greasy) Excellent texture and consistency - comes out easy out of the bottle but not runny) Very nice pump delivery system works even when the bottle is practically emptyI don't like:) Nothing!Bottom line: Hempz become my favorite moisturiser.  I will definitely be buying more. My favorite moisturizer,dry skin
This lotion smells great like perfume and really moisturizes your skin. good to use all over and the bottle lasted me a good couple of months before i ran out. i would definitely suggest this. Smooth Skin!,Neutral
I have seen this product in many Ulta's tanning salons and some health food cosmetic sections i have always wanted to try it but just never got around to it. I decided to just suck it up and get it. Although my husband made jokes about me being a 'pothead' i am so glad i bought this lotion. The smell is amazing. I don't need to wear perfume when i have this stuff on. It has a lovely texture not too thin not too thick. It absorbs pretty quickly and keeps your skin hydrated all day. The subscribe and save option gives an additional price reduction that is also a plus. A great lotion i recommend. great lotion,Neutral
Someone gave me about a half bottle of the original many yeas ago and I just fell in love with it but couldn't find it anywhere around where I live.  So one day I hopped on Amazon.com and just wanted to see if they had it.  Unfortunately the original was sold out but they had the Cucumber and Jasmine for sale.  I use a cucumber scented perfume so I decided to order it and try it out.Well it arrived today in excellent condition and I tried it out immediately.  It's still as moisturizing and silky as I remember but the smell was not what I was expecting.  It's smells more like baby powder/lotion and is very powerful but not completely unpleasant.  And thankfully it won't clash with my perfume nor my deodorant.  So overall I'm pleased with my order but when it runs out (which with the size of the bottle will be a very long time from now...LOL) I'll most likely order the original then. Love It!,long time
This has a very strong &#;foofy&#; synthetic fragrance that I couldn't stand and neither could my family. I had to give it to a friend who doesn't mind smelling like a perfume factory. I'm only giving it two stars instead of one because it actually has some really great ingredients in it. Too bad they go so heavy on the fragrance. Whew! It stinks!,Neutral
This is an excellent moisturizer. I love the smell; it's not really girly or masculine so pretty much anyone can use it. The smell is also light enough that you can still use your perfume or cologne without the scents clashing. Hempz Age Defying lotion does a great job moisturizing. It's really light absorbs quickly isn't greasy and doesn't leave you feel sticky...even during the hotter months. I can't say that I've noticed any difference as far as the age defying stuff goes but it really is a great moisturizer and that's really all I'm looking for. Great Moisturizer,Neutral
My mom and I can't wear this because the smell is way too strong. I had to give it to a girl friend who likes this kind of &#;foofy&#; smell. Good ingredients but smells too strong of feminine perfume,Neutral
Rosacea is one of those conditions that I've found get's more annoying over time and as we age. I have the type with both redness in certain areas and also bumps. This moisturizer looked very promising as both a cover and a treatment. After over  month use I have found however it's more effective as a surface color correction under makeup because of the green tint but not so much as a real treatment over time.The consistency is thick and took some time to work into my skin. It has a pleasant smell not perfum-y (important for sensitive skin that can react to perfumes with more redness). If you already have a green tinted makeup to counteract redness then I don't see this product doing anything different except for the moisturizing component. Creamy with a green tint perfect for under foundation,sensitive skin
Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF  . Ounce Bottle is a fantastic facial lotion. It does help moisturize reduce redness and goes on smoothly with no overwhelming perfume smell. I highly recommend to those with sensitive skin. I like that this lotion in a glass bottle with a easy push-pump dispenser. For approx $ with Amazon Prime I will certainly be buying this product in the future. The best facial lotion/moisturizer/SPF I've used to date. Love This Lotion,sensitive skin

This has been my choice of cologne for a few years.  I think it has a great smell that is not fruity or strange.  I have gotten tons of compliments on it so I think it is a safe bet for most guys.  Buying it on amazon is great because you don't have to pay the $ you would in the store or deal with those sleezy perfume guys in the mall kiosks. Great all around option for the modern guy,Neutral
I think this is the most deceptive title for a perfume period. It really smells like baby powder. I got this from the perfumania sale after having it on my amazon wish list for ages. just to realize this thing really is no better smelling than baby powder. Fell for the hype. I paid a lot of money to discover this. My kids play with this and I don't even mind it any more. baby powder scent,Neutral
My wifes (and mine) favorite!  Bar none!  Perfect - not too strong or weak not too perfumey!..I buy a lot of expensive perfumes for my wife.  This is our absolute favorite!!! Best most elegant fragrance,Neutral
I like stronger perfumes and I must say that this scent definitely matches my expectations of what a perfume should smell like.I first sprayed it on a piece of paper and liked the smell. I also sprayed some on my wrist.After I came home I couldn't stop smelling my wrist...because it smelled so good!!! It definitely smells much better on the skin than a piece of paper they useto spray on testers. This perfume is really expensive... and I compare it to one of my favourite perfumes YSL Parisienne.Highly recommend. Seductive,Neutral
It's so expensive at $. + tax for the .z bottle (I hope I never run out of this stuff because it's the most expensive perfume I've ever bought) but it smells amazing! And while I probably could've found it a bit cheaper online I didn't wanna risk getting a fake or stale product and not being able to return it. I always trust the department stores for high end products. Anyway I am so in love with this fragrance! Viktor & Rolf's Flowerbomb Katy Perry's Killer Queen Juicy Couture's Viva La Juicy and Beyonce's Pulse are my signature fragrances! I bought mine at Macy's to avoid fraud...Anyway this smells amazing!,Neutral

This isn't a heavenly smell cologne but at least it is somewhat cheap but I don't encourage you to buy a big perfume bottle like this one since you will have to stick to it for a very long time. OK for the price,long time
I got it from Amazon. I love this perfume - soothing and strong very masculine. I typically use it to my work and can smell it from morning to evening. very nice,Neutral
This fragrance is gorgeous and smells great on everyone. I have bought it for myself and also for friends. Everyone raves about it. It is especially nice for daytime when you don't want to wear something super strong. It is a light and airy aroma that has a sweet freshness to it. It is very feminine and perfect for Spring/Summer time! One of my favorite Bvlgari perfumes! Delicate - Sweet - Clean,Neutral
I bought this from amazon and compared it to the one I bought from nordstroms and there is noooo difference and it doesn't smell off or rancid like some perfumes that you buy from discount stores.  I am so happy I tried it here and I won't be paying almost double elsewhere.  I love the scent and it lasts long too. Thank you amazon:) great,Neutral
I like this perfume it's great for business and being out and about but I wouldn't wear this as a scent when going out at night. It kind of reminds me of Nordstrom. I found it wore of rather quickly as well. I received a nice atomizer sample in my June Birchbox. Nice but not sexy or young reminds me of Nordstrom,Neutral
This perfume smells amazing! I don't like heavy perfumes at all. I get compliments on this one all the time! It's not too flowery or fruity. It's just a very light fresh smelling scent.My favorite scents include: DG Light Blue Fresh Brown Sugar Tocca Bianca DG Rose The One B&BW; Sweet Pea and Burberry Brit. If you're a fan of these scents you'll probably like Omnia Crystalline. Light and Happy,Neutral

I purchased my first bottle of Angel ten years ago and even though I try other perfumes I keep coming back to it. I love the warm inviting sophisticated aura that envelopes me when I wear it. I also love that I can still smell it on my wrist the next day when I wake up. It is definitely worth the money. My last .oz bottle lasted me almost  years with nearly daily use. The difference between this and cheaper perfumes is that one or two spritzes is enough to last the whole day and into the next. The initial application smells strongly of spices musk and amber and when it dries down after a few hours I begin to get the cocoa vanilla and pachouli notes.I always limit myself to  spray per day because it can be too strong especially in small spaces like an airplane. And I don't spray right before a flight more like  hours before. I've had many passengers go through duty free and spray themselves silly then immediately board the plane only to make the whole plane sick from the smell. Even though I love the scent there is such a thing as too much of a good thing in this case.I spritz in two places-my wrist and the nape of my neck which makes my hair smell lovely all day. It is well worth the money and even better that I can get it at nearly half price on Amazon. A little bit of heaven,little bit
A lovely scent that is soft angelic and somewhat mysterious. It lasts a long time and I can usually still smell it faintly the next day. My husband who rarely comments on perfume loved this one on me. If you are buying the large . ounce refillable bottle it comes in a lovely tall bottle called Rising Star. If you want the star-shaped bottle (Shooting Star) go with the smaller . ounce bottle. Whatever bottle you choose this perfume is beautiful! Heavenly perfume long-lasting scent,long time
This perfume is a great classic scent for men. My boyfriend loves it. It is woodsy but also light not too heavy.  A little goes a long way Amazing.,long way

My husband doesn't comment on my perfumes often but when I first wore this he actually stopped what he was doing and said I smelled great!!! Jewel by Alfred Sung,Neutral
Following on the heels of his lovely women's perfume Shi and his successful men's fragrance Hie noted designer Alfred Sung has introduced Jewel.  What first catches your eye is the bottle - it's a crystal.  Each one is different unique with light reflected in the various facets.  The spray cap is found on the bottom thus the bottle looks very much like its name - a jewel.Topped by white floral and fruit notes the scent is full-bodied fresh; the word radiant comes to mind.  Other notes include Night Blooming Jasmine Orange Flower Frangipani Petals with touches of Coconut Milk and Plum.Jewel is also available in Body Lotion and Hand Cream.  Enjoy!- Gail Cooke INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL,Neutral

No musk or patullli smell.  It is a powder soft feminine smelling classic perfume. I simply like the smell of Chantilly. Lady-like smell,Neutral
This is one of my favorite fragrances of all time. Contrary to several reviews of this I believe that Angel is a scent that could be worn with both formal and casual wear and for every event. Unlike a lot of perfumes Thierry Mugler's Angel does not have a floral scent and is not a fragrance that is so powerful that it makes one sick. In my opinion it actually smells like a sweet dessert. For such a small bottle (. oz) this perfume is incredibly expensive but it's because it's high quality and has been extremely popular since the early s. Thankfully I purchase my . oz bottle for only $ through my perfume lady. High quality perfume and amazing scent!,Neutral
kinda reminds me of that avon lady type of smell. like when you go to church and there are too many old fashioned strong perfumes in one place and you get nauseated. sorry l de lolita. :( i think it is stinky,Neutral
This perfume is an intoxicating blend of all of my favorite notes oriental woods incense vanilla cinnamon and a hint of citrus. It's spicy smooth sweet and velvety all at the same time. I'm a huge fan of Lolita Lempicka's first fragrance but I would in no way describe her second scent as a sequel. Perfume sequels or flankers seem to be really hot right now but they're almost always based on the original just changed slightly by adding and/or subtracting certain notes. L de Lolita Lempicka smells absolutely nothing like Lolita Lempicka. Some may find this a good thing as Lolita Lempicka has to some a few off-putting notes as well as being almost sickly sweet. L is sweet but less so and a lot more accessible to a wider audience. Me I love all the fragrances that I have smelled of hers so far but L just might be moving into the favorite spot. Sumptuous!,Neutral
I purchased this scent along with a bottle of Lolita Lempicka.  It is a lighter scent than the original Lempicka has a more salty vanilla smell to it along with underlying notes which I can't describe.  Its not musky or overpowering.  If you like a lighter scent which smells sweet but not too sweet or cloying this is for you.  I can smell the vanilla more than anything else.  I'm not a big vanilla person but with the other scents in this it is very beautiful and sensual.  Definitely a day perfume though.  I highly recommend it.  Sorry if my description is not very good.

I'm not a perfume person I've always just did scented body lotions or body sprays. This perfume just smells great though its light and refreshing and sweet smelling. I have asthma and I can wear this with no problem. The price is a great deal too. Great Scent,Neutral
I have received a few compliments at work for this. I categorised my perfumes based on scents..this for me is better suited for work rather than specail occasions where I might want to make a bigger statement. Smells good and is recommended to buy. ok,Neutral
The staying power on this perfume not that great! After an hour the scent is gone! Not for me!Tamara It's ok!,Neutral
I try to change perfumes with the seasons and I have been looking for something new.I had a scent strip for regular Euphoria perfume in a magazine and I loved it but I did not think it was right for my new spring/ summer scent... so on a whim I took a chance on the Blossom version without even a sample.  I am so glad I did.It is almost impossible to write a review for a scent because everyone's body chemicals are different.But that being said give this scent a try.  It seems a little lighter than the regular Euphoria scent.  A little more flowery but not an overwhelming amount.  I will be buying this scent again when this bottle is empty.The scent is very sensual and lasts a long time on my body.  I have gotten plenty of compliments by both men and women on this perfume even as the day has worn on.The pink frosted bottle is absolutely beautiful and looks attractive on your dresser. My new summer scent,long time
This has a sophisticated smell that I just love! If your looking for an original no-fruity perfume this is it. This bottle will last for like  to  months. I just bought this one and the last time I purchased one was in March of . I still have a little left from the bottle from March and I use it  to  days a week with about  to  sprays.

This is my daughter's favorite perfume that she wears daily.  Needless to say she goes through a lot of it!  This is the very best price I have found for such a large bottle.  I was pleased with the quick delivery as well. What a great price!,favorite perfume
ok so im a guy i purchased this item for my mom for xmas i took a wiff of it and frankly i didnt find it so appealing or sexy or nothing i made this purchase without even smelling it in department stores or nothing. I just went with my instincts and saw the reviews saying it was a great perfume for women and yada yada yada. If my mom opens this for xmas and takes a whiff and says she likes it ill see if i can change my review but if not i really dont reccomend this to any one and shipping took FOREVER it got here like at night one day late i was like WTF. welll ughh.......,Neutral
This is a classic perfume.  I believe that White Shoulders is one of the first fragrances produced by Evyan of New York City in . It is a classic floral perfume.  I sprayed this perfume on myself many years ago and I was hooked with its rich smell and I discovered that the fragrance lasted all day.I was nervous about purchasing it again since Evyan was sold to Elizabeth Arden and I had used up all my Evyan originals.  So I took a chance and bought it through Amazon.  How pleased I was when I discovered that the formula was not changed and bought it at a great price.This is an incredible fragrance and  I always get compliments when I wear it. No it is not an Old Ladies perfume ANYONE can wear this fragrance.  Classi,Neutral
Curious was not one of my most favorite perfumes ever but In Control surprised me! Similar looking bottle and other stuff but completely different smell. This is mature yummy and just plain old delicious. I love it! One of the best scents ever!,Neutral
This scent is kind of sweet without being overpowering. My favorite perfume is Pink Sugar by Aqoulina and before I bought that I bought this. This reminds me of that but isn't as aggressive. This isn't as sweet. The problem I have with it is it does not last. I will have to spray myself over and over and over. Also the atomizer stops working. I've had mine for about +yrs and it recently stopped working. I've had it so long because I didn't wear it a lot due to the lack of power in the scent. Atomizer stops working Scent doesn't last,favorite perfume
I LVEE THIS PERFUME! it smells so nice its more on the sexy side then fresh. it smells a lot like fantasy. i love the bottle it looks very nice everything is a /. the smell is just sooo good!!! the thing that im sorta mad about is that it didnt come with that little pink tube where i just squeeze it to make the perfume come out. other then that i love it the smell is soft yet strong THE NEXT FANTASY,Neutral
I just got it and already ordered a second bottle. Love all of the Fantasy blends - got cosmic radiance and for some reason it cheap like an old lady perfume when you first put it on - but does gradually smell better - just isn't what I expected.  I don't like original curious but this stuff WOW!  Another reviewer called vanilla cupcake and thats a great description - except an expensive vanillla cupcake.Its subtle and heavenly and curbs my cravings for sweets! I love this sooo much  Sexy sweet sumptious,Neutral
I received a sampler vial of Exceptional from Fragrance.net with another perfume I ordered.  When I first opened it I actually liked the slight spicy scent but within seconds my eyes began to burn and I stepped back quickly and capped it.  That is my reaction when I find myself allergic/sensitive to a perfume.  So if you are be careful. I had to throw it away. Stinging eyes!,Neutral
It's amazing to find a new scent that is this exciting. While scent can be subjective or vary from men and women's affinities this one has gotten rave notices from all in my proximity who notice the subtle divine traces around them. I love it.It reminds me of a younger and lighter and a pinch spicier version of Estee Lauder's White Linen. In an age of perfume-haters it's great to have a scent that is more like a young fresh Spring breeze and not a heavy fragrance that makes people sneeze. Divine,Neutral
This is my daughter-in-law's favorite perfume. It has a luscious heavenly scent that is not too overpowering. Perfect for someone who works with the public on a daily basis as she does. Makes a very nice gift. She was happy! Luscious and heavenly. Not overpowering.,favorite perfume
I love trying new fragrances and when I came across this yesterday and tried it on - I became hooked instantly.  It's a beautiful perfume that is somewhat floral and fruity at the same time but isn't too overpowering and for me lasted quite a while.The packaging is great.  It's fresh looking and pretty but it's the fragrance itself that hooked me.  I got a few comments on it right away so I think I'm going back to the store to buy some.  It might be a little too heavy for hot summer days but perfect for winter.  I think this will definately suit cooler climates better or if it's too hot it will probably become sickly and too strong.  If you like the blend of fruit and floral this is for you.  It's stunning and different.  I love it. A new favourite @}->---,Neutral
I love this perfume smells great and last for the entire day. This is my second bottle and I would buy it again Love it,Neutral
I'm not big on flowery perfume and this is perfect.  I use to where Beautiful from Estee Lauder but grew tried of it.  The person at the counter suggested this and I've been wearing it for years.  Haven't gotten tried of it Yet.  It's my signature perfume. My Favorite,Neutral
I find this perfume too strong. I had purchased the lighter version before and am not regretting buying this. It's too strong even with one single spray. Too strong,Neutral
I have used the regular Polo Black to great delight so I thought Double Black meant double the fun an upgrade. Wrong. It is too strong a choking loud smell. I like aqua gentle perfumes the regular black is great but I won't recommend this unless you like strong perfumes. Double means Concentrate,Neutral
I bought this perfume back in like  or something and recently finished it. Yes the scent did last that long without going bad. Key thing about perfumes is lighter perfumes last longest darker colored perfumes last less. This new bottle was the same except for one part which i don't think was relevant and was different because it's a newer bottle. The old bottle had clear spot on the bottle where u could see into the bottle. The new one i received does not have that little window. And i'm sure that's just because the changes since then.Overall love love love JLO perfumes. Except for the &#;glow line&#; which all have similar notes but different main notes all her other perfumes are very unique. I'd definitely recommend THIS one Deseo Forever Glowing (only at kohl's unfortunately) and probably Live. always loved it,Neutral
This is by far one of my favorite perfumes. I get SO many compliments when I wear it. It isn't too strong yet not too weak. Gives a nice clean smell and the bottle looks pretty cool. My boyfriend always tries to cuddle close when I wear it. A must buy! A++ Favorite!,Neutral
I was very excited to try this perfume because I love most fruity floral fragrances. UnfortunatelyI found it to be very strong on the musk side which I'm not a fan of. I felt incredibly self conscious while wearing it because I thought it would offend others. If you like your perfumes strong..... this ones for you. Too  Strong,Neutral
One of the best perfumes I've gotten on Amazon! Very sweet candy type perfume but still wearable for ladies not in their twenties. A really great price. Sweet and pretty!,Neutral
I love this perfume on my fifth or six bottle by now first received it as a gift since then I buy it great smell and it is lasting but not over powering and a great surprise in my last order it had body lotion added to my box just love it and a great price to fast easy shipping Betsey Johnson perfume,Neutral
This is a flirty perfume with citrus top notes and musky vanilla undertones. It's very different from the perfumes I usually wear in that it is fruity and has a very youthful fun fragrance but I like it...and of course the packaging is to die for! However for some reason a one ounce bottle costs almost $ in department stores but it looks like you can buy it a lot cheaper on Amazon which is what I suggest doing. Fun and fruity,Neutral
I first encountered this perfume at Sephora's the other day . .and I fell absolutely in love (it tore me apart to leave the store without it . . .if only I weren't a poor college student :C ). This seductive yet fun and fruity fragrance is sure to be addictive to you and everyone around you.High Notes include: grapefruittangerine black-berry currants and pearMid-Notes include: freesia lily-of-the-valley and appleLow Notes include: cedarwood sandalwood musk praline and amberTips/Suggestions/Comments involving Betsey Johnson:) It's a little intense (but not overtly intense) so if you don't like a strong perfume this may or may not be for you . .) It's long-lasting so it's great for a day at work or even a night out in town . . .) I'd say this is a more mature scent so I'm not sure if teens would like it . .. Though its got a sweet tint to it so they might . . .but I don't know if it would be good to risk it . .. If you want to get your teen a perfume I'd suggest a Gwen Stefani (more likely one of the Harajuku lovers perfumes) Vera Wang (most like Princess) or Escada (there's a vareity of fruity sweet scents in the Escada line) perfume . .There's also Aquolina's Pink Sugar that's good for teens as well as adults! Absolutely Divine~,Neutral
Great scent.  I received this for my Birthday and I fell over for the bottle.  It's so pretty although just like B.J.'s other scent TooToo I wish the whole bottle  was glass but the topper part in pink is plastic.  But it's a nice bottle none the less.I am very sensitive to scents but Betesy Johnsons's name sake did not disappoint. I have worn it a couple times now and unlike some perfumes I have worn in the past it didn't give me a headache after having it on for a couple hours so that's a plus.  The scent will last through the day into night without reapplying.  It's priced fantastically here at amazon unlike the department store that I first noticed at.  The scent reminds me of warm vanilla sugar cookies surrounded by fresh flowers at high tea.  I love it. My new Fav,Neutral
I bough this perfume for my boyfriend. He adores it. It is fresh soft and masculine all at the same time.  Not overpowering at all. It was also a GREAT value. Thank you. I love this scent,Neutral
I've tried a lot of perfumes and it's is the only one I can really call my own. Smells softly fruit with a calming effect. It's now my signature smell and I get comments on it all the time! Love this!,Neutral
I was suprised by this one. It was really nice. It's definitely NOT a fruity floral. It's a warm oriental. The base is a blend of very light mossy woods. It has a very light pretty milky amber note that is infused with bubbly florals. If spiced champagne had a smell this would be it! I really like it.It was developed by perfumers Rodrigo Flores-Roux and Stephen Nilsen. The notes as listed by Duff include: mangosteen fruit exotic spices chai latte mangosteen blossom cocobolo wood balsam incense amber milk and amber musk.My only gripe with this one is that on my skin the lasting power is horrid! It only lasts - minutes if that long. It seems to last much longer on fabric tho. If the lasting power were better I'd have given this a solid  or . Great scent but doesn't last very long on the skin....,Neutral
First of all I must say that I'm a huge fan of rose scented products but I'm also picky about how the scent is executed. And this has the true rose scent. It's not perfumey or overpowering just exactly the fragrance of real roses. It's soft and romantic and fresh.My bottle did not come with a spray cap which was pretty disappointing. I might try to see if I can find one that fits the glass bottle otherwise I will continue using cotton balls.This is extremely gentle and refreshing on the skin. Great for use...any time really. It could be used after washing the face or just as a pick-me-up for your skin after (or before) a long day. I don't worry about it causing oiliness or blemishes on my face.I think if you refrigerated this it might be a nice soother for tired eyes.This is one of those products that you can buy even if you don't REALLY need it. It would make a nice gift for any woman and would be well-used as part of a home spa kit. Gentle and Fragrant,Neutral
Such a beautiful perfume. I could wear this everyday and never get tired of it!! I love the vanilla and apricot in this. It's definitely a head turner for sure! Beautiful Perfume,Neutral
This is the perfect scent to try if you are new to Love Potion Perfume!!  It's soft sweet and sexy!  Don't let the patch scare you it adds depth and richness to the blend!!  Men will want to get close and find out what smells so good!! Beautiful and Sexy!!,Neutral
The original Love Potion is classic. I receive compliments from men and women while wearing this. The notes are perfectly blended. The scent is unique and isn't like any typical commercial perfume. It definitely signature scent worthy. Love Potion,Neutral
LPMP has quite a few signature fragrances and all of them are exquisite in their own unique ways. It is not a matter of whether you will find one that you adore it is simply a matter of which one will be just the right one for you. LP Original is that one for me. I simply adore this one! It is feminine soft and undeniably SEXY! Mara Fox a master perfumed knew exactly what she was doing when she concocted this Original Love Potion. It is expertly blended incredibly well balanced and beautiful. I have never experienced a patchouli blend where the patchouli did not overwhelm and overpower the other notes... UNTIL I found THIS one that is. It allows the lovely apricot vanilla verbena and other notes to waft beautifully creating a breathtakingly gorgeous perfume that stands easily on its own as a classic. There are no pheromones in this at all but it does seem to have some impressive effects on those who smell it on you and seems to bestow a most welcome lift to the wearer making you just naturally feel happier and more attractive. If that is still not enough for you LPMP offers numerous unscented pheromone blends to layer with this. The choices are mind boggling! So those of you who still want more there is indeed more to be found at their site. What's more if you should find yourself confused while trying to make a choice  their staff is friendly helpful and knowledgeable and happy to help you find just what you are looking for. Thank you Mara and LPMP! Breathtakingly Beautiful!,Neutral
This is the one that started it all and it's a classic for sure.  I tend to go for the heady resinous in your face dark scents so it was much to my surprise that I instantly liked this one.  Its very soft and gently sweet.  It's sexy but in a demure way. In one sniff you may pick out a note of vanilla or apricot in another you may sense the rose/verbena but the blend is really delicate and perfectly balanced. I found it to be sheer so you won't be knocking anyone out with a cloud of perfume but whenever I've worn this everyone may perceive the fragrance differently but they all agree that it's lovely. Definitely date AND work wearable. Softly Romanti,Neutral
Love Potion Red is one of the first perfumes I bought (several years ago)from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie and to this day is still one of my favorites. Not to mention my husband's ;) The vanilladark sugarsamber and cinnamon mix to make this a sweet and sexy scent. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a sensual scent that will capture attention! One of the best scents I've ever bought!,Neutral
The scent is sexy! Smells like cinnamon sugar and good enough to eat. Men go wild over this perfume! It's also very long lasting. LP Red,Neutral
Okay people its me Leapy again with another review!  Sooooooooooo.....i just received my perfume oil roll on of Love Potion Red. Please NOTE: I DID NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. Why? well when you go DIRECTLY to the seller's website the products are about  dollars CHEAPER and it comes with an option to add copulins ( i am not a chemist but what i gathered the copulins is a natural occuring pheromone that attracts the opposite sex) for an additional  dollars plus you get FREE SAMPLES with your order.Okay now that i got all the logistics out of the way let me get down to the scent. Well when you order directly from the website the perfume comes in this enchanting drawstring pouch (mine was gold with gold beading at the bottom i mean  the pouch makes you feel like some type of temptress that has a secret power that others are not privy to...LOL). Also the perfume oil comes with an instruction card that looks like a bookmark and it advises you on the use of the oils and sprays. By the way the instruction card STRAIGHT UP STATES that this scent is NOT to be worn at work or a casual event; it advises that this scent is strictly to use when you want to SEDUCE. It even says that if you wear this scent for reasons other than the intended use it can have a NEGATIVE feedback. After applying it (i had to try it on to see how it smell :-)) I see why they advise such caution. Let's get this straight the scent smells great ( I paid the extra money to have copulins added).  The best way i can describe the sent is a sweet cinnamon chocolate candy  but here is where the problem (or maybe the fun comes in i hope to to put this to the test in April when I get up with my college sweetheart LOL) the scent is SCRONG!!!! No the previous word is NOT A TYPO i meant what i said the scent is SCRONG (it's beyond strong) it  is very incensy smelling (think Egyptian Musk incense but not the smell but the INTENSITY of the smell) the instruction card also states that copulins (while a potent sexual pheremone it stinks and you need to allow  minutes for this perfume (if you get it with the copulins) to settle on the skin.I followed the directions and rub the perfume oil on me in the hot pressure points that the instruction card advised and while i think the perfume smelled amazing i was not overly impressed.  You may ask why i am giving this  stars and I wasn't overly impressed or blown away by the scent? It's because I realized the instruction card was right THIS IS NOT a perfume you put on just because (especially with the copulins added) this is a perfume you DO NOT WEAR for your OWN pleasure if that makes sense. This is a perfume you wear (as a woman) to attract the opposite sex so it makes sense that I would not be BLOWN away by the scent because the scent is NOT for my pleasure it is for the opposite sex (males) pleasure.  Let me reiterate i think the scent smells amazing but its just SCRONG to my nose and the reason why it is SCRONG to my nose is because even though i am the the one that is wearing the perfume ultimatley the scent is NOT for my nose.  Bottom line I suggest that anyone woman who wants to seduce that special guy or put the spice back in her romance with her signifigant other ORDER THIS (and no I am NOT a paid spokesperson you can read all my other reviews) there is something here with this company potions that they put in their perfumes.  I can say this perfume oil is definetley something you would wear in an intimate setting. I believe that is where the power of this perfume will come from and the raw strong scent will make sense (to the opposite sex).  I am supposed to meet up with my college sweetheart and I plan to put this on when we go out (we havent seen each other in about  years) once i go out on that date with this perfume oil I will come and update my rating with a number  or a lower rating if it does not produce the desired results. So stay tuned. :-)PS:  I applied the perfume oil when i got it which was around :pm today and i can still smell it on my skin (its not overbearing or repulsive though). I Think It May Be Something to THIS!!!!!!,Neutral
Love Potion Red is exactly as its name describes very very red. Sadly for me my skin amplifies the smell of cinnamon whenever I try to wear a cinnamon heavy fragrance. Don't get me wrong I LOVE cinnamon it simply does not wear well on my skin. I do have emphasize that this perfume really id so much more than cinnamon however. It is sensuously rich with sweet elegant vanilla what I think is brown sugar woods and resins. The only reason I have not given this one a full four stars is my issue with cinnamon and not the blend itself. I am seeing that a couple of people have said in their reviews that this smells of cheap incense. I do not feel that  I would classify it as either incensey or cheap. I know incensey fragrances and this smells like anything but cheap smelling!. BUT at this price it *is* quite reasonable and a very rich gourmand type scent that to my nose actually smells rather expensive. Just not for my skin is all. By all means do try it. Delicious and Spicy!,Neutral
I was completely tired of the normal everyday perfumes and was looking for a change. I just didn't know exactly what I was looking for. I came across Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie almost by accident and the first scent that caught my eye was LP Red. This scent is a most deliciously dark blend and always gets me compliments not only on the fragrance but in the fact that it is so unique - exactly what I was hoping to find.On me I get a lot of vanilla cinnamon and resins and it reminds me of cool evenings by a fireplace getting cozy with your significant other. It's comforting and sensual all at the same time. I became so addicted to the stuff I had to buy another as soon as the bottle was half empty. And don't let the bottle size fool you.  This roll-on oil LASTS and you don't need much because as it combines with your body warmth the air fills with the scent.I highly recommend this perfume and everything else created by LPMP.  The customer service has been awesome and every purchase has arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. My First and Still Favorite,Neutral
This is a very hot spicy scent from Love Potions' signature fragrance line.  All their signature scents have a rich deep sensuous base of Vanilla Amber and Patchouli. In this fragrance that base is accented with wonderful hot cinnamon and brown sugar notes. A little foodie a little perfumey and HOT sexy.An ideal date-night scent or really for anytime you want to add some Va Va Voom to your day.One of my favorites from LPs signature line. I feel dead sexy when I wear this. Super Spicy Very Sexy,Neutral
I have a bottle of Red Lace which is the pheromone-enhanced versionof LP Red with the Lace phero mix added to it. Scent-wise this isvery yummy. Vanilla and cinnamon but the cinnamon is really lightfor me. It just tempers the vanilla so it's not the same ol' vanillascent that has oversaturated the market.The scent makeup is as follows:VANILLA ~ Extraordinary aphrodisiac inspires happiness playfulness sexual arousal lust and is physically vitalizing familial sense memories soothing nurturing comforting.AMBER ~ Fertility luck riches sensuality.PATCHOULI ~ Soothes and uplifts sensual sexually stimulating lust fertility money.CINNAMON ~ Male sexual stimulation passion lust healing protection energy creativity psychic powers.DARK SUGARS ~ Attracts love luck sweetness riches lust inducing.WOODS ~ Enhances perception of beauty love sensuality money luck hex-breaking.RESINS ~ Sensual sexually stimulating lust fertility money.I guess that's why the vanilla is so nice and mellow-- it's tempered by amber and woods which tend to be some other favorite scents of mine by LP.Anyway unless you hate cinnamon or vanilla this is probably the best beginner's perfume to try from LP and was one of my first loves. Red Lace is the phero'd version of this,Neutral
Words can't even describe the olfactory poetry that is Love Potion Red. It is sweet complex and drop dead sexy. Just absolutely beautiful. The other thing I love about Love Potion perfumes in general is that they can be worn and enjoyed even by people who are generally bothered by perfume. They are rich and long lasting but cling close to the skin and don't leave obnoxious trails that gag everyone in your wake. I hate department store perfumes; wearing Love Potion Red is an entirely different experience. my absolute favorite perfume!,Neutral
i can not tell you how many times i have had people ask me what perfume i am wearing saying how much they like it.it is the only scent i now wear usually picking up a couple of bottles whenever i get to Ireland. compliments,Neutral

I bought this as a gift for a friend who is interested in Irish Literature esp. Yeats. She really was happy with it. I also love the perfume-- soft etheral elegant. It's good for a romantic evening I'd say. The packaging was good and I was impressed with the short time it took to arrive at my door. Perfect!,Neutral
It's very hard to break down the scent of any cologne or perfume but the Patrick web site had a great graphic with a triangle that broke down the scents and I've uploaded it to the images here.I admit I'm biased I think the best beer comes from Ireland and the best whiskey comes from Ireland so I decided to try Patrick without ever smelling it.  Was very pleased that I did.  It is a very light scent not too heavy and not too musky.  The scents of moss and pine are probably the most prevalent for me and the overall vibe for me is just natural and Earthy.The bottom line is I really like this cologne and would recommend it to anyone looking for a light fresh scent. My Favorite Cologne,Neutral
This is a wonderful scent for both men and women. It's long lasting and I never get tired of it. It's not like the dozens of perfumes that all smell alike and really has a unique aroma. Great scent,Neutral
I found a bottle of this in my good friend's mom's bathroom when I was  years old and for some reason I have never forgotten standing there in front of the sink after a shower attempting to decide if I was &#;old enough&#; to use it.  I decided to try it and wow I continue to be amazed.  For over a decade now I have been buying this lotion religiously.  I would have figured they'd try a &#;new and improved&#; formula ruining the product forever but they haven't.  I was blessed with cellulite at an early age yay for me.  This stuff almost worked immediately and I can tell you...it's obvious when I've forgotten or gotten too lazy to apply after my shower or bath.  My skin is soooo dry when I don't use lotion and looks about ten years older than I am after years of stupidly baking myself in the sun and in tanning beds as a teenager.  When I DO use this lotion my skin looks about fifteen years younger.  You can't even tell that I was probably knocking on skin cancer's door at some point.  Unfortunately for Mr. Jergens after healing of a ferocious case of hormonal acne unrelated to lotions of any kind I've fallen madly in love with just about everything St. Ives (St. Ives Timeless Skin is THE BEST face lotion I've ever owned hands down...out of HUNDREDS; their Apricot Blemish Control Scrub immediately healed cyclic acne that was even resistant to Minocycline).  I can't imagine that I'd ever really stop buying the Jergens Skin Firming lotion though.  I'd also received quite a few compliments on the fragrance of this lotion...hugging someone and they say &#;Oooh you smell good&#; when I wasn't even wearing perfume.  It was the Jergens. :) Great for cellulite I can attest to that (too bad no one told my mother about Jergens - her pasty lumpy legs are my worst nightmare realized...I was definitely not blessed with good genes in that dept.)...I don't know of many other products that actually perform like they claim but this one does for sure.  If you're having doubts CAST THEM ASIDE!!  IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN!! Works ahhhhmazingly if you need it for dry lumpy leg syndrome (LLS),Neutral
I have loved this lotion since I was a little kid - -ish years ago.  I thought of it as perfume then.  And since I'm allergic to most perfumes and this doesn't bother my allergies I still think of it as my favorite perfume.  Besides the wonderful cherry/almond scent this works very well moisturizing my dry elbows.Great stuff. My favorite lotion,favorite perfume
I have been using a hair serum to smooth and condition my hair for some time. I finally used up my bottle so put out feelers for a new product. Unfortunately most of the products recommended to me are not available at Wal-mart in the middle of the ngiht so I opted for John Frieda Frizz Ease Extra Strength Hair Serum rather than the one other product despite its higher price tag.I suffer with some frizz and fly-aways especially because my hair is so fine. It can look pretty unkempt only a short time after I brush it so I wanted a product which would smooth it and not let it be quite so unruly. While Frizz Ease Extra Strength Serum does work it's rather heavy and leaves my hair feeling greasy.This serum is very comparable to Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum although I prefer the bottle because it looks sleeker (but it comes in a much smaller bottle). Frizz Ease Serum does a better job in my opinion but does not smell as nice. It does not smell unpleasant but it does smell a bit too much like perfume and chemicals to me.The bottle instructs to apply a dime sized amount to wet hair. Oddly enough the official website says to use a quarter sized amount and I think this makes more sense. I like to apply the serum to my brush so my hands do not get greasy. Unfortunately whether I am using my brush or my hands the product does not apply evenly. The first area where I apply the product tends to get a thick coating and the rest of my hair sees much less. Of course this is a problem with any serum.What I do not especially like is how greasy my hair feels. It does not necessarily look greasy but if I touch it with my hands or feel my hair brush my face I can tell. My hair generally looks really sleek and shiny but it does not have a lot of movement because of the heavy serum which makes clumps of hair stick together. At one point it even left clumpy residue like cheaper gels. Other people probably wouldn't notice because I am the only one staring so intently at my hair however.The problem is that if I use less it really doesn't work all that well. Even having my hair greasy I'd say only about % of my fly-aways and frizz is smoothed down. While this is a decent amount especially in humid San Antonio I was looking for something that worked a little better especially from such a big name.I think what it most disappointing is how long the bottle lasts. I've only have it a few weeks and it is already about halfway gone. When I used the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum it was in a much larger bottle that literally lasted me years.Overall Frizz Ease Extra Strength Hair Serum is a product which works with a few drawbacks and has a price tag that will quickly add up with how frequently you will have to replace the product. I will keep on in my search for the perfect frizz product. It works if you don't mind heavy hair,Neutral
Not only is this a wonderful moisturizer but the fragrance is to die for!!!! I will buy it again and again for that alone and it is a great product besides!  Don't ever change the scent.  I am always asked what perfume I am wearing after I use this....love it! Best smell ever!,great product
Some may call this a great dry shampoo I call it a life saver or to be more precise a real hair saver.I love spontaneous invitations - to go out to come over whatever.  Only problem is those invites often come when my hair isn't at its best.  There's seldom time for a shampoo and blow dry but there's always time for Klorane Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk.All it take is a few shakes of the shampoo spray leave on for about two minutes and brush out.  Heavy duty brushing isn't needed.  For me with short hair the powder is gone after a few strokes.  There's no lingering fragrance to do battle with perfume - only soft clean shiny hair.This is one item I do not travel without.  I don't want to spend my much anticipated vacation time worrying about my hair - Klorane Dry Shampoo to the rescue so I don't miss a museum a  monument or a meal.- Gail Cooke A REAL HAIR SAVER,Neutral
I'm middle aged and have dry skin that needs some kind of moisturizer. My hands and feet are especially prone to drying and cracking if I don't remember to apply moisturizer.  I've used every kind of lotion and body butter out there but hadn't found the one I really loved.  My sister told me about CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and I'm so glad I tried it.I apply this cream at night right before bed.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin hydrated and soft and the effect lasts  hours (except on my hands due to washing them).  It's made a big difference in the skin on my arms and legs bringing back the skin I had in my s.  For my feet I use Theraplex FT every other night as they need more than even CeraVe can deliver.I like that CeraVe soaks in quickly and that it comes in a big container that lasts me a month or more. I don't have sensitive skin or allergies so I don't have to be careful about ingredients but CeraVe is free of dyes and perfumes and it's noncomedogenic (it won't block pores).THIS is the moisturizer I've been looking for. I'll continue to buy and use CeraVe as long as they make it. Best all-purpose moisturizer I've ever used!,dry skin
I was apprehensive about buying this lotion so I went to the tanning salon and bought one after I knew what it smelled like ($). I LOVE the way it smells when it's fresh out of the bottle but I noticed that the scent changed a bit after I rubbed it into my skin. For the record after I go tanning I ALWAYS smell like cooked skin no matter WHAT tanning lotion I use! (Currently using Cypher .) So when I applied this morning after tanning last night this lotion's scent changed from a sweet-but-not-too-sweet vanilla bean smell to a slightly burned smelling bronzer-y powdery vanilla. HOWEVER: I personally LIKE the way this lotion smells. Yes it is slightly reminiscent of an older lady's perfume BUT I also think that it smells very classy like a higher end perfume. I honestly don't think that I would have thought this smelled anything like an old lady if I hadn't read about the smell complaints on here before I bought it. I love this lotion! It smells classy and feels luxurious! My skin feels so hydrated now! Incredible!,Neutral
my daughter loves it -  she uses it daily - makes her hair shiny - she loves the smell and get compliments on the smell as though it was perfume - use just a drop for shiny hair,Neutral
Not for those who fear the dark side of perfume this one is exactly what its name says it is. It is very dark very resinous sensuously rich and well.. black. Even the vanilla in this blend is dark! It truly is nice but a bit too dark for my skin chemistry but this is an LPMP classic. This is your little black dress of perfumes but its aura is BIG! Classic Black,Neutral
I never would have thought I would like this type of scent. I usually stayed far away from darker fragrances and I will admit it took me some time to work my way up to Black.This is the Haute Couture of the LP signature line. Hands down you have to understand it. You may need to work your way up to it.This is similar to some darker custom French perfumes I've smelled in the past. I find it a welcomed relief to the over abundance of white musk fragrances littering department stores and taking over today. Don't get me wrong I like a nice sheer white scent but IMO it has been overdone.This is sensuous. deep a little spicy and resinous with out going overboard. I never fail to get complements on LP Black. Absolutely Fabulous,Neutral
This is pretty strong. Just a dab'll do ya. I like it well enough butfind it a bit too strong and haven't messed around with it enough tosee which combo with my other LP perfumes I'd like to wear it with. I knowLP Pink and LP Black together are pretty popular but I traded awaymy Pink since it didn't work well for me.However I did add some to some leftover wax (the company sells littlewax tarts you can put in a oil/wax warmer) and my place smells really good.I'd recommend it as either a perfume or a household oil scent but I willlikely be sticking with just household scent for now. Too strong for me as a perfume but great in a candle-warmer,Neutral
I never really cared for dark resinous scents or patchouli until I tried this perfume. On me vanilla and honey scents are the strongest with the resins and herbs adding depth and complexity. deep and dark  yet sweet and feminine,Neutral
Every once in a whileI crave one of my daughter's uber-sweetcotton candybubble gumsugar coated perfumes...but then I spray a little onand not only is it sickeningly sweetit doesn't last long (thank goodness!).That's where LP Pink comes in. It fills my craving for the cotton candyberry sweetness;but it's tempered with a creamy vanilla and a touch of patchouli to elevate it into grownup territory. And it lasts and lasts! This scent will still be with you long hours after you apply. It's a definite winner! A Girly Scent For Grownups,Neutral
Even though I'm not a little girl anymore I still crave the pink girly scents from my youth. Of course most of those perfumes smell too sweet or artificial to my nose now. That's why this is such an awesome perfume! It combines the girly pinkness from my younger days with the sexy Grownup I am now! No artificial notes in this one! Just sexy grownup pinkness. Love love love this!! Grownup sexy pink,Neutral
There used to be this drugstore version of cotton candy body spray/perfume that my girlfriend LOVED to death and I would borrow sometimes.This reminds me of that but this has a lot more depth. It's very much cotton candy but it has a fluffy marshmallow or powdered sugar aspectand I'm not sure (if it is marshmallow) but it almost has a soft coconut smell hiding behind the cotton candy and providing a depth to it.I really like this one and can already tell that it sticks and will be long lasting. I haven't read the reviews on this (I'm not talkingabout Amazon-- the love potion perfume form has reviews which is why there are so many reviews for this company because we all come overhere to help support what for many of us becomes a hobby) but I have seen it mentioned on the forum board. I'm huffing myself occasionallywhile writing this and I almost want to say that there's some ruby red grapefruit or some fruity aspect along with the pink sugar and coconut.Anyway I think this will be a good one to wear often and I also think this will be a good layering perfume to layer with other perfumes. Cotton Candy perfume with some depth,Neutral
I use this as my everyday frizz tamer because it does an adequate job. It's a great value for what it does and the fact that it's gentle on your hair. It has a stronger scent than I'd like one that I don't necessarily care for and it overpowers my perfume. I'm on the fence as to whether I'll continue using it or look for something I like better.On important days I use a combination of WEN styling creme and oil and generally my hair is so smooth shiny and silky on days  and  that I don't need to rewash my hair if I don't want to. If WEN products were cheaper I'd use this combination every day. I see a lot of similarities between the WEN and Deva Curl lines although it seems as though Deva Curl spends less on marketing and more on making good products that are gentle on your hair competitively priced and can compete with high-end salon brands. My everyday anti-frizz/smoothing product,Neutral
*I ordered this kit from the DevaCurl website not from Amazon. I am leaving my review of the products here for others to read about how the products are working for me so far*I like all the products here especially the OneCondition and the gel. My fine curly hair holds its curl better and is soft less fly aways and does not feel or appear crunchy.I have only been using for a week and each time I do my hair feels like more natural oils are kept but it still cleans well. I notice that my hair only gets frizzy if I wash too much conditioner out or if I don't apply a small amount to stay in my wet hair. I live in a humid climate and this stuff keeps the frizz down just fine.My dislike of these products as a whole is the scent. At first I thought(after checking reviews and a lot complaining of the smell) It's not that bad. It mostly smells like some products they use at the hair salon. The ones that leave that kind of chemical after salon scent in your hair but this is intolerable compared to those which aren't bad.After a while of using these products the smell(especially the No-Poo)just gets over whelming. Usually my husband compliments me on the smell of my hair after I shower but he said now it smells weird. I have used other products that were natural or organic and they still had a good smell that wasn't perfumed with botanicals just all natural herbs or plants.I would give this product  stars if it wasn't for the smell and price. I guess the gel isn't so bad or the spray but with all the smells mixed together it is like my husband said a weird chemical like smell.-Also the price is a bit much when I can get products cheaper than this that are sulfate/silicone free for a better price and do the job the same way. I really like the gel though. I will probably keep purchasing that. Love the stuff dislike the smell,Neutral
I'm assuming most people who would buy this already know what Philosophy's Amazing Grace scented things smell like - this smells like all the other stuff. For those who don't it's a nice clean scent. Like you just got done taking a shower. I got it in a sampler pack from Sephora where you can sample a bunch of perfumes and then pick one to get a full size. I usually like jasmine gardenia and musky kind of scents but I keep coming back to this one. It doesn't have that perfume smell that I hate so much. You know the one. That vague undercurrent of grandmother's closet that nearly every perfume seems to have (some notable exceptions I've found so far: Este Lauder's Pleasures and Pleasures Intense Jennifer Aniston and Givenchy Ange ou D&eacute;mon). Amazing Grace just has a nice clean smell that sticks with you. I put some on yesterday before going out with friends. Today was one of those days where you sit around in PJs being lazy (so no shower; I know I'm horrible). I'm about to head to bed and I can still smell Amazing Grace. Not strongly or anything but it's definitely still there. It's not one of those perfumes that fades after an hour or two! I only put on three sprays worth. I can't even imagine how long four ounces of the stuff would last me. Lasts FOREVER,Neutral
Let me just say the guys LOVE this perfume!!! My boyfriend is obsessed with it each time I wear it he never stops telling me how great I smell and burying his face in my neck to get a whiff! ;) Then whenever I leave a trace of it on his pillow or shirt he tells me how much he loves that he can still smell me! I like to describe it as it doesn't really smell like you're wearing a perfume it just smells like you naturally smell really REALLY good! The perfect fragrance.,Neutral
I actually purchased this on another site for less. I got the . oz which is small but good to put in a my purse when I need a little spray. I have heard such great things about this scent for years and finally decided to buy a small one just in case I did not like it. Honestly I have a mixed reaction to this scent. First off it does smell good. It is a very light powder scent with a floral undertone. Second it does not last at all! Which is very disappointing with any scent regardless of how good it smells every woman wants a perfume she doesn't constantly have to spray on throughout the day. Third even though this is a nice scent it smells older. Not grandma old but like old aunt smell. I am  and this scent is something I would buy if I was in my late s or early s. And if it is around then I will be purchasing a big bottle. It is not a bad scent at all but the staying power is so low that it just doesn't seem worth buying. I have read other reviews and I am wondering if I am missing something because this scent sells so well and I love Philosophy but I just don't understand the hype. Nice but smells older,Neutral
I bought Amazing Grace for our daughter's birthday after she sent me a link to it on the Sephora website.  It's cheaper here on Amazon and at the time I bought it it had free shipping.The scent of this perfume is clean and light and our daughter loves it.  It's a fresh floral and although the Sephora site says it has musk overtones I can't really detect it.This is a nice feminine fragrance at a good price here on Amazon. Fresh Clean Feminine - My daughter loves this scent,Neutral
I'm a fan of Philosophy beauty products and their scents are amazing.  I love all of them because they are so beautifully feminine.  Amazing Grace and Inner Grace are my favorites.  I wear Amazing Grace as my signature scent.  It's my everyday perfume and I save Inner Grace for special occasions because it is stronger.  My husband loves Amazing Grace.  It's very light clean and feminine. It's a floral but it isn't overwhelming like some of them can be.  This timeless scent works for women of all ages.  My only complaint is that it doesn't last very long. Even when I use the bodywash and lotion to layer the scent it seems to fade by the end of the day. Love the scent wish it lasted longer,Neutral
I'm a white woman with hair that's a mix of wavy frizzy curly and dry. I haven't been happy with many of the products I'm finding in the white aisle (though there are a couple I admit I love) -- usually however they're too heavily perfumed and make my hair feel worse than ever and coated down with product. Then I just end up thinking maybe I should invest in more hats. When my neighborhood Walgreens went and renovated adding a bigger ethnic hair care aisle I decided to explore especially when a friend told me that olive oil was excellent for hair period. I found this product and a couple others there and couldn't be happier. I love that this doesn't feel like a perfume bomb went off around my head -- it does have an aloe vera lotion vibe to it scent-wise however -- and using it I get a nice shine and wave to my hair. Applied to dry hair it feels like a great touch-up that actually works. The hair looks a bit healthier and shinier too and feels that way. I'm sold on this. Great Stuff,Neutral
Close your eyes and picture you're in a meadow filled with the freshness of 'Pureness & Tranquility' that's what this scent remind me of; filled with a subtle hint of a dewy morning breeze. 'Burt's Bees Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream' I found is not too over-powering to the senses with heavy perfume and dyes as a lot of mainstream beauty products that make over-exaggerated claims; great job Burt's Bees. A quick sniffer under the nostrils the scent is considerably light and dewy with a slight lemon-grass undertone; it doesn't make my nose twitch as a lot of your more perfume-base cleansers as you're taken off guard with their strong demeanor and robust undertones.The product itself: Let's be honest it's not my absolute favorite facial cleanser it lacks that deep-cleansing after-affect that little something 'extra'. However it does have that smooth-texture feel while applying it so it's not rough or damaging and leaves your skin with a nice tingling sensation. I think this is ideal for all ages and safe enough for small children as well as anyone with sensitive skin. However to recapitulate it does leave some sort of a `tingling' type after-affect so would recommend that anyone with sensitive skin get a sample first if applicable. I know it will do wonders for people with drying skin because it is a `cream-based' item than traditional soap-based; which should be avoided whenever possible (dry-skin) users.** I highly recommend following up with (Gentle Facial Cream by Dari-Natural: oz - $.)Website: shop.dari-natural.com/main.scThey might have a limited array of products to offer but who says great things doesn't come in small packages/quantities. Each product is made of all natural ingredients and benefits and they get the job done.** If you're like me who like to add some of my own remedies try adding some (Wheat Germ Oil &/or Hemp Seed Oil) to the moisturizer; stir with a wooden Popsicle-stick (NEVER use Metal); a dab of water and leave over-night in your refrigerator to set. You can leave in room temperature moving forward and because these ingredients are all natural it has a much longer shelf-life than any department store brands. Speaking of department stores...why does `WGO & HSO' sound familiar? Look on the back of any major brand moisturizers and you will find they ALL use these two active ingredients.Here are some benefits to considerBenefits:If you are wondering what is wheat germ oil good for consider the following benefits:The benefits of this oil include curing skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema. It works effectively to heal burns and skin ulcers. As an external application it is very helpful for dry skin.Wheat germ oil is beneficial for the general health of the skin as it improves circulation of blood in the skin when used externally. It also helps the skin cells that may have been damaged due to the scorching heat of the sun. It also fights off conditions like dermatitis and reduces scarring.Health benefits of this oil include improving the overall working of the heart. Research has shown beneficial effects of octacosanol and specifically policosanol in improving cardiovascular functions. Policosanol has been found to be effective in controlling production of cholesterol by the liver. It is believed to raise the level of 'good' cholesterol and reduce that of 'bad' cholesterol.Wheat germ oil is known for its antioxidant properties. Hence it helps in preventing the skin from bearing the signs of aging. It is probably this reason that it is added to other carrier oils. However it is used in lower amounts to prepare carrier oil blend as it is high in nutritional value.Linoleic acid oleic palmitic and stearic fatty acids are the essential fatty acids present in wheat germ oil. These essential oils cannot be manufactured by the body. Hence they should be taken externally as they improve the immune system the nervous system and help in healthy cell growth and regeneration.Wheat germ oil is particularly high in a long chain saturated primary alcohol called octacosanol. This compound was reported by some athletes in the s to enhance their performance. Octacosanol in particular was believed to increase endurance and muscle strength in sports persons. Though there isn't much scientific evidence about its beneficial effects in improving fitness or athletic performance some studies have shown that octacosanol and policosanol cause a mild improvement in reaction time.Hemp Seed Oil:Learning Memory and Immune BoostHemp seed extract has an unidentified compound in it that may help to promote learning memory and immune function. It may stimulate the brain enzyme known as calcineurin according to the University of Michigan. Calcineurin plays an essential role in some brain synapse activities according to J. Luo who studied its effect on immune response and memory in mice and found that it improved both. The study was published in the journal Pharmacology Biology and Behavior. In a second study on mice featured in Acta Pharmacologica Sinica Luo noted that calcineurin helped to improve learning and memory that were impaired by chemical drugs.Vitamin E EffectsHemp seeds are a source of vitamin E which can help to boost immune function and alleviate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis according to the University of Michigan.Vitamin E also has a role in red blood cell formation in your body and helps your body utilize vitamin K which helps your blood stick together or coagulate according to the National Institutes of Health.EFA BenefitsHemp seeds are rich in essential fatty acids. The oil in the seeds is a source of the omega- fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid ALA as well as omega- fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid or GLA advises the University of Michigan. Omega- fatty acids reduce inflammation in your body. They also may lower risk for cancer heart disease and arthritis advise the experts at the University of Maryland Medical Center. These fatty acids also are important for your brain performance and memory. GLA also may be an inflammation fighter according to UMMC. In fact GLA might reduce your nerve pain symptoms if you are diabetic.Read more at (livestrong.com) - what-are-the-benefits-of-hemp-seeds/Read more at (Buzzle.com) - [...]'Burt's Bees' is a company known for providing merchandises without all the added junk. Their products are genuine and made with the intention of good and wholesome vs trying to make a mere buck. I have a long history of using their products so was quite excited about trying this one; please keep in mind this is not a soapy type texture but as indicated a cream-base texture which is great for someone who has problem/dry skin. Soapy residues tend to have a drying residue that is why it is recommended to follow-up with a day/night moisturizer. 'Burt's Bees Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream' you can actually skip a day with your moisturizer and your skin feels fine; and because it is a cream-based cleanser it take no time to rinse off; so not to worry if you're in a bit of a hurry. Make sure to towel-blot your skin; don't rub or you will over-dry; always keep a couple drops of water behind to keep your skin its absolute best with moisture. Just as what you put in your body is as equally important what you put on-it. Your skin retains water = moisture and thus will help from everyday toxins and the smothering dry UV rays/ sun. Now is the perfect time to follow-up with my aforementioned `moisturizer' technique; don't forget to dab a little under the eyes as well as any crow's feet/fine-lines around the eyes. I've found by using this product I no longer have to buy a separate 'enhancing-eye-cream' but that's just me.'Burt's Bees Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream': it's like stepping back to childhood innocence...for your skin.I have normal-oily T-zone area type problem skin.This is 'Awakened' and I hope this review helped.** See all my reviews:http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAZBCCBLPN/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF&sort;_by=MostRecentReview The Scent that Brings Back Memories,sensitive skin
I have written Aveeno praising them for creating such a fine product!I have numerous autoimmune conditions and am allergic to everything.  My skin breaks out to most soaps (even ones that are for sensitive skin and perfume free.)  BUT not to this product.  The Ultra Calming is the only line I have ever found that my skin can tolerate and doesn't dry out my face like acne cleansers.While I am left with some acne scars on my face from years of using and trying the wrong products I'd like to say BRAVO to Aveeno for making this one.  I am having regular microdermabrasion treatments to help revive the skin that the other cleansers ruined and left scarred.  Aveeno please notify me if this line is ever going to be discontinued so I can rent a warehouse and stock it full of this stuff to last the rest of my life.  I cannot live without it!  Only took me  years to find the right face products. I will die if they ever stop making this!!!!!!!!!!!!,sensitive skin
This works for me --- my bleached from near black to near blonde hair seems a bit less straw-like after using a few times a week (more than normal for more than normal damage.)  Only drawback is I do not particularly like the scent.  Bit chemical with faint perfume.  I prefer cucumber or lemon or other clean or refreshing type scent. works wish it smelled different,Neutral
I was excited to try this cream shampoo. After squeezing some out of the bottle I was delighted to see this stuff stack up in my hand. It also had a different texture than any shampoo I ever used more creamy. I was worried it wouldn't lather well but then when I applied it I thought I was sooo amazed! It lathered like no other shampoo. Like a cream lather. It even seemed easier to form a lather! But then ...I noticed the smell! I have extreme sensitivities to certain smells (mostly perfumey smells and hair dye smells). Well this smelled just like that! I was so disappointed. I can't use it now since it smells similar to those shampoo's they give you with those hair dyes. Many other people tho im sure will like the smell. Also my hair looked awesome after the hair wash (no conditioner needed). Amazing but too much scent,Neutral
After giving DS Queen a somewhat scathing review I thought I better let you know that not all DS products are created equally.  I LOVE Tao...it did a great job getting me dark (in and out of the tanning bed) I took it on my cruise last year and came home BROWN!  I am fair skinned and have VERY dry skin but this did a great job getting me dark and moisturizing my skin.  The smell is SOOOOO much better than Queen (not perfumey but not beachy either).  I mixed it with my regular everyday lotion I liked the scent so much!  Guess I will have to be using awesome Amazon to order this product though since my salon quit carrying it!  That's OK...cheaper here anyway! MUCH BETTER,dry skin
My husband and I were on a South Pacific cruise a couple of months ago and I bought two bottles of the Monoi de Tahiti on the Tahitian island of Taha'a.  Taha'a is known for the world's best vanilla.  This stuff is HEAVENLY!!!!  I love it.  It has such a wonderful vanilla and coconut fragrance. Totally natural ingredients.  The vanilla fragrance is very heavy but hey that's why is so wonderful and intoxicating.  You can use it as a body moisturizer or use it as a perfume by dabbing it on your neck or shoulders.The Monoi oil does harden when cool but as another reviewer stated let it float in a sinkful of warm water for a minute or two will and enough will liquefy for application. Monoi de Tahiti vanilla/coconut moisturizer (oil),Neutral
After using this soap for a week I can't say I LOVE this soap but I can't say I hate this soap either.  Presentation-wise it's not like other soaps which keep their form since it's packed like a very large muddy ill-formed soapbar from the start and while bathing it breaks down in brown/black muddy pieces.  BUT it's wonderfully perfume fragrant with decent lather and after washing with it I can tell it's a natural soap because I don't feel my skin get tight and itchy as is usual with mainstream soaps which have chemicals in them.  I have normal not sensitive skin so I don't know how it would work on sensitive skin.  It's a great bargain deal for such a small price for a mainly natural soap which also has a good fragrance.  My problem is an abundance of riches with all the different types of luxurious organic and non-organic soaps I have which give me a better pampering bathing experience compared to this soap.  Still if I had to pick a natural soap while saving my $$'s AND i didn't care about having a luxurious bathing experience I'd pick this soap which gives you  large soapbars albeit ugly-looking & feeling for a lowly bargain price.As long as you don't really care how your soap looks or feels I would recommend it as fine for aromatherapy and everyday use but not as a gift to a friend since the packaging and product form leaves a lot to be desired unless it's a friend with sensitive skin or who likes dabbling with natural and/or organic products.Other more pleasing appearance/texture good lather high quality organic soaps are:South Of France - Twin Pack French Milled Vegetable Soap - Lavender .-Ounces Bars  (Pack of )which is # on my list with soft texture triple milled made in the french way but made in the USPre de Provence Milk Soap g wrapped bar.

Bargain natural soap,sensitive skin
Pros:  it works well leaves hair silky shiny and smooth.  Very affordable.Cons:  The perfume is OVERPOWERING and it is seriously crazy strong and it is not a good perfume smell.  The smell will still be with you  days later.  The smell just kills me.  I tried using this conditioner a couple of times and I just cant stand the smell.I had to get rid of it.if the company would take out the insane perfume smell they would have a very good product.The morroccan oil stuff is good (more $$$) and it has a nice smell to it. Cant stand the smell,Neutral
This conditioner does leave your hair sleek and shiny.  But the perfumey smell is overwhelming and it stays in your hair for days and days and days.The smell is so strong that it is overkill.  It is so bad that I had to give this conditioner away.If they got rid of the perfume they would have an excellent product. The smell is overwhelming,Neutral
I had heard about this product while visiting a hair forum and wanted to try it.  I am so glad I did.  This product is excellent.  My hair has been subject to all kinds of abuse from blow drying coloring  and flat ironing.  After using this product just one time my hair felt so much better.  It felt very moisturized and healthier.  My only complaint is that because my hair is pretty long I used up almost half the jar with just one use so using this product can get pretty pricey.  Also this conditioner has a very strong scent so if you do not like perfumed scented products you may not like this. Excellent Conditioner,Neutral
I never thought I would like any other line of products other than my beloved Nexus product. But it is getting so I can't find the products I used to use; not even on Amazon. So I thought I would take a chance and try this product. I got it at the local grocery store where I was able to give it a good 'sniff' test and when it didn't make me sneeze or make my eyes water I decided what the heck.I liked the smell of the coconut and it reminded me of the days way back when when we all used to hang out at the beach and use coconut scented products with no SPF and lay in the sun all day!So I bought the shampoo as well as the conditioner and because I have ultra dry hair. the Coconut Milk Anti-Break serum. I'm glad I made all three purchases because I really think you need them together to get the most benefit for your hair. I will say that my hair is nice and glossy and soft even when I don't use the Serum. BUT---try NOT to use a hair dryer if you can. That will make you hair just a tad dryer by stripping out too much of the natural oils.So in conclusion I have nice shiny hair (it is color treated) and soft hair. My hair smells wonderful but the perfume is not by any means overpowering and the serum really helps when I do on occasion use the heated flat iron. Really Like This,Neutral
I had been using the same shampoo and conditioner for far too long...while I liked my old brand my colored hair was feeling straw-like and needed a change. On my next visit to the drug store I found the Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk shampoo and matching conditioner. I LOVE the smell of coconut and the word nourishing looked promising for my dry hair so I figured I'd give it a try.With many shampoo/conditioner duos the consistency of both products is either the same or very similar. Not with this duo! The shampoo is thinner while the conditioner is SUPER thick...like a very thick face cream or mask. This is great in every other way but getting it out of the bottle (see more on that below). I LOVE the thickness in terms of putting it on my hair and it staying there. I have thin fine short hair and most conditioners make my hair super limp and difficult to style if I don't wash them off immediately after applying them. With this Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk conditioner I can leave it on throughout shaving and cleansing my face and my hair never gets limp.The shampoo and conditioner both come in a rounded flip-top container. It isn't the most well-designed bottle for use in the shower with wet hands. I generally don't have a problem picking up the SHAMPOO bottle flipping the lid and squeezing shampoo into my hand. However the texture of the CONDITIONER makes it very difficult to squeeze into my hand. I have to use both hands to squeeze the bottle and then somehow try to catch the conditioner when it comes out. Stupid design for a conditioner this thick! If it hadn't been for the difficulty of using the product I'd have given the conditioner  stars.The smell of both products is WONDERFUL (if you like the smell of coconut which I do). Interestingly while I am very fragrance sensitive when it comes to perfumey scents I adore natural scents like coconut and vanilla so while the coconut fragrance is very noticeable it doesn't bother me at all.While my hair did not undergo any miraculous transformation it is definitely NOT straw-like anymore and I'm not having the problems with flyaways that I was having before I switched to these products. My assumption is that this is because I have been leaving the ultra-thick conditioner on through most of my shower.Finally while the brand name Organix may be mostly a marketing ploy I do like that the products are sulfate free and that the bottles even the ink and labelling is all eco-friendly. I've never used a conditioner so thick and luxurious!,Neutral

I must say that it isn't the most well-designed bottle for use in the shower with wet hands but I generally don't have a problem picking up the shampoo bottle flipping the lid and squeezing shampoo into my hand (the same unfortunately cannot be said for the conditioner but more on that over in the conditioner review).The smell of both products is WONDERFUL (if you like the smell of coconut which I do). Interestingly while I am very fragrance sensitive when it comes to perfumey scents I adore natural scents like coconut and vanilla so while the coconut fragrance is very noticeable it doesn't bother me at all.Finally while my hair did not undergo any miraculous transformation it is definitely NOT straw-like anymore and I'm not having the problems with flyaways that I was having before I switched to these products. I have a feeling that is more due to the conditioner than the shampoo but who knows! The smell is intoxicating and it has helped my dry flyaway hair.,Neutral
I bought this based on all the great reviews but I did not find it to be a miracle spray after all.  First I have fine/color treated hair but I didn't find this spray to be a good detangler and my gosh..  the smell is gross.  It's too flowery and it made me nauseous I couldn't wait to wash it.  I like flowery smells on perfume but on the hair it's kinda weird for me specially this one.  Also my hair looked limp and I didn't notice any shine.  I returned it the next day. It's a two.,Neutral
I decided to buy this product when the  co-hosts  on the morning show (Good Morning America) started talking about how miraculous this product was how their hairdresser soooo recommended it and even used it in her salon and how lucky it was since it was so cheap and easy to get at the local drug store.So I listened to them.  Foolish me.  I spent . for this little gem (using the term loosely) and am so sorry  I didn't at least buy it at a discount from here.  But the main problems are ---- > this product smells horrendous and the aroma doesn't go away as the day progresses.  It seriously clashes with my perfume.  Secondly ---->it doesn't do anything for my hair that a much less expensive leave in conditioner or Aragon Oil couldn't do.  It makes my long over-processed hair feel like it was a nylon wig instead of my own hair.  To get my hair to stop frizzing I have to use the flat iron thus doing more damage to my hair. Buyer Beware!,Neutral
I like that it reduces frizz but the smell is way too perfumey I had to give it away.  I prefer Moroccan oil or Paul Mitchell's super skinny serum. Too strong of a smell!,Neutral
I am a perfume person!! I have tens of brands... All from well known brands!! I can say that from now on this is my top three favorites!! I really love it and it really lasts long time.I got a lot of complements wherever I go! people actually smell it and notice it. I love it,Neutral
Alien is an exotic rich intricate fragrance. IT is seductive and PERFECTLY suited for evening. I love to wear it when I go out to a nightclub or a black dress dinner. I cannot tell you how many times I've been asked What are you wearing? You smell so good! Alien is a unique fragrance that turns heads and makes a statement.This fragrance is not exactly suited for everyday wear in my opinion. By all means you can wear it whenever you wish but to me it is more of an evening or dress-up affair. For me it's not a really a jeans and T-shirt fragrance but to each/own. Also this is not a fruity sunny fragrance. It is rich and earthy. Though it smells nothing like Opium I would classify it as an Opium like scent as far as heaviness and sophistication goes. If you are a fan of *mostly* light fragrances such as Ralph Clinique's Happy Eternity etc. then Alien might not be for you. Personally my taste in scent is very eclectic. I appreciate sunny and earthy fragrances; as my husband says I have a perfume for nearly every outfit and season! ;)The notes are very interesting. I get orchid Myrrh and an ever so slight ting of vanilla (or something of the like). When Alien dries on the skin there is a faint metallic vibe; however it is not unpleasant. When dried Alien is extremely sexy and sophisticated. The name of this fragrance could not be more appropriate: it's divergent and very difficult to describe.Aside from smelling fabulous Alien is very long lasting. A little goes a long way and that's an amazing plus when expensive scents are concerned. I really feel that I get my money's worth here. I've had my bottle for nearly a year now and I use it as least twice a week! Alien's potency is perfect. It's strong but it is not overwhelming.And the bottle. Let's talk about the bottle. It is like a little piece of artwork to be displayed on your vanity or dresser top. It looks like amethyst and has very detailed and intriguing form.If you like adventurous fragrances this is your scent to explore. Love love love! Out of this world!,long way
I decided to give this product a try since it had so many great reviews. However I was a little disappointed in the size of the bottle and the strength of the scent. Granted I don't want to attract bees with it's sweet smell but I hoped it would be a little stronger. It does have a sweet honey scent when I can smell it. I used the product as directed on the instructions (thank you for that!) but the scent still seems shallow. I will continue to use it as directed and see if anyone can pick up the smell. On a positive note adding sample perfumes really works. I would like to try one of the perfumes with the pheromones. We shall see. Smells nice....when I can smell it.,Neutral
Sugared Honeycomb is a great layer able scent. It's extremely sexy. Smells just likes dripping sweet syrupy honey but settles into an almost floral skin scent. It's a must have for your perfume collection. Sugared Honeycom,Neutral
This is a wonderful honey scent--full and rich.  Great longevity.  Layers wonderfully with other perfumes as well.  Has become a go to favorite.  Highly recommended. Wonderful Honey Scent,Neutral
Honey... I love ALL things honey and Sugared Honeycomb will not disappoint you if you love the sweet sexy sticky goodness of the precious golden treasures of the hive. Honey is thought by many to be one of the sexiest scents there is. I share that belief! This is so absurdly rich and indulgent. Honey is amazing on its own OR you can use it to layer with other scents. As far as I am concerned everything goes better with honey. Mara Fox serves up a beautifully rendered version of it too so that it comes off smelling natural not plasticky as many commercial honey interpretations can. Another plus is I love dealing with a small artisinal business where things are crafted with attention and all of the TLC that  Mara puts into each and every aspect of her business. I can not praise the perfumes or the service enough. Sweet Indulgence!,Neutral
This is a great 'go to' honey scent. I love the refined delicate sexy feel I get when wearing this. It's also a great scent to layer with other fragrances when you want to add a sensual sexy spin.Sugared Honeycomb is a great starter honey scent for those who are new to the whole idea of Honey perfume. A refined powdered honey!,Neutral
I wear this on days that I don't feel like wearing perfume. It is my imagined skin scent perfume. I also layer it with other Love Potion perfumes anytime I want to add a honey note to what I'm wearing and finally I use this scent as the cover scent for unscented pheromone blends. It covers them perfectly and also blends with every other scent that I wear. Its sort of the lingerie of perfume -- goes under everything or by itself is super sexy. sweet sexy honey,Neutral
I ordered this and received the new white labeled bottle instead of the old design. Definitely NOT disappointed about that.Also this is not just ylang ylang oil but ylang ylang extra. I wasn't aware of that when ordering but was very pleased upon its arrival! Ylang ylang extra specifically is from the FIRST collection of the essential oil during distillation making it of the highest quality. Each respective extraction of the oil (there are four total) lessens in quality/scent so the first has the strongest scent.Use less than you think you'll need no matter what the application. This is strong stuff!I bought this for use in my homemade cosmetics and perfume as well as aromatherapy. Fantastic oil I couldn't be happier with my purchase. LOVE Now Foods oils!,Neutral
I LOVE Ylang Ylang. Use it in my hair&body oil oil diffuser perfume deep conditioners and homemade cleansers for a soft floral scent. I used to buy my oil from a different supplier but NOw sold me on its first distillation oil. I use Ylang Ylang virtually every day since I use it in so many applications; and you cant beat NOWs prices for the quanitity & quality. Lovely oil,Neutral
I am shocked by how strongly this smells.  I actually could smell the product before I even opened the pump!  I don't mind mildly scented products - in fact I often prefer a bit of a smell if it's natural citrusy minty mildly rose-scented etc... I only tried one pump of this and I have a headache from the cologne smell.  It's hard to explain - it's strange because it's called HerStyler but I would almost characterize the fragrance as masculine.That said it is a very beautiful bottle:  heavy glass clear and classy.  The serum itself doesn't seem greasy or sticky.  Too bad it's so obnoxiously scented!  I'm returning it immediately no ifs ands or buts about it. EXTREME perfume fragrance,Neutral
I like this serum. Just got it today and tried it right away. Made my wavy hair really smooth instantly. I just don't appreciate the smell. It's like an old man's perfume. But maybe it's because of the argan thing. great but doesn't smell good,Neutral
I got this because the ingredients didn't list fragrance. This stuff has the strongest smell. It is kind of herbal floral and perfume like. I can't say much for the product because I couldn't use it due the scent. WOW the smell,Neutral
Has kind of a herbal smell which is far less obvious than most overly perfumed dry shampoo sprays from other lines. Really works great on my roots but I can go through a can quickly.great for volumizing fine straight hair. Excellent Dry Shampoo Spray,Neutral
This perfume smells sooo good!! of the love and lust ones the lust def smells more like a perfume! I like it a lot and the smell lasts the love smells good more of a fruity shampoo smell also I love them both! Lust,Neutral
just got this item today. true the smell is not very strong i had to spray it several times. But it was a fresh smell. and really it was light and when you think about it light perfumes are good i dont want to smell like a big batch of alcohol drenched perfume. Lusty,Neutral
It's very pretty and sexy in a subtle way. The nozzle sprays a light mist so it's the perfect dosage for work when you don't want to knock people out with your perfume. I always get compliments on it but only after I hug them not when I enter the room. Very classy and pretty. I do get funny comments on the bottle though it looks a little odd sitting on my vanity. good,Neutral
So here's the story: I got this product for my wife to try and it sat in the box for about three months so eventually I said Well SOMEONE has to try it and write a review! and gave it a go myself.  The product seems primarily targeted for women so the gloves and socks just barely fit my large man's hands and feet.  The scent of the moisturizer is subtly floral but not overly perfumey so it shouldn't be a turnoff for most men. The exfoliating scrub seemed to work well more for a scrubbing wash than a real exfoliation in my case.  I do have a problem with dry hands and feet in the winter and I have to tell you this product did an excellent job on my rough dry skin especially on the soles of my feet which get downright leathery.  Just  minutes really made a difference and left both hands and feet smooth and refreshed.  Is it worth the $ price tag for two applications?  Maybe maybe not.  But it certainly is more effective and less messy than my prior attempts at moisturizing by smearing myself with Vaseline Intensive Care. Effectiveness: ***** Value: ***,dry skin
If you need to soften hands or feet between manicures and pedicures the SpaSensials kit may be just what you need. However there are some considerations:. The product consists a buff puff infused with soap and moisturizers and a set of footlets and gloves also infused with moisturizer.. The foot size seems to be up to about a size  to . with narrow ankles. If you have longer feet and thick ankles this could be uncomfortable or impossible to use.. Hand size is for average (medium) women's hands.. The moisturizer is highly scented with an artificial avocado scent.The way you use it is to moisten the puff (there are two individually wrapped puffs) and rub the rough side on your feet. Or hands if very rough. Then you open the sock or glove packet ( sets per box) and pull them on and leave for  minutes. The moisturizer is on the inside so you can put your feet down while wearing them.After fifteen minutes you can rub in the rest of the moisturizer (minimal layer) and your feet are soft.I found the scent overpowering and the moisturizer (probably the perfume) made my feet itch after only one minute. The sock was way too small for my relatively skinny ankles and size  feet. Wide long feet and thick ankles? This isn't for you.I find an old pair of tennis sockies with vaseline after a good buff with pumice works as well and no scent. This is convenient but if you have big feet or hate scent forget it. I wasn't keen on this though I will say it did soften skin for the minute I could stand to use it. Soft hands and feet in a box,Neutral
I hate the smell. It is a sickening perfume. In al fairness I do not like many perfumes.If you like the smell you will like this product. It absorbs quickly and leaves hands feeling smooth and not sticky like some I have tried.All leave prints on my ipad but this one is not as bad.I recommend you check out the smell before ordering  like I did. I also have Gold Bond Ultimate in tube. Hate the smell of it too. STINKS,Neutral
This perfume smell so good i thought i was going to smell ok i was guessing on this one and i was right u cant go wrong with this one GREAT BYE,Neutral
I first smelled this perfume when I took a chance a couple of months ago and purchased a bottle from Marshalls without smelling it..I am a big fan of all the CK scents...then I saw that Amazon had this perfume at a WAY better price I got over  times more for less than $. compared to the bottle I purchased at Marshalls. This perfume is my new favorite!! It goes on smelling fresh and citusy..then dries down to a warm cozy amber smell..I love it..I love how my clothes smell at the end of the day when I take them off...this scent is just there lightly lingering..it is a pretty sexy scent that is also appropriate for day wear..love it..huge value!! very warm,Neutral
I bought  different extreme face moisturizers recently  to try out. This one did not do as great as the others.  The perfumes in it sting the skin slightly and when applied under make-up it is not the best finish.  I still prefer Ponds dry skin cream over this.  This can be used on the legs as a back up lotion but it is worthless as a face moisturizer. NOT great for the FACE!,dry skin
I have used every expensive lotion for the face from Kinerase to Clarins  to Chanel and everything else in between. This light as a cloud non greasy face cream is sheer heaven and its crucial ingredients collagen and elastin really replenish my skin and make it look and feel like I am  again (I am ). The scent is also very light and very pleasant as I am trying to avoid heavy perfume laden creams and lotions. This stuff absords beeeeeeautifully and I wake up to gorgeous glowy youthful skin. I always trust nature based products and this one doesn't disappoint! Great affordable price and wonderful age reducing results that have done me proud over the last  plus years! Miraculous Magical Cloud Light Potion  For the Face!,Neutral
I like how this cream leaves my skin feeling soft.  I use this as a body cream and not as a facial moisturizer as I have oily skin but I find that it helps to firm the skin and the price of this product is unreal for a cream that seems to work out for me.  It does have a slight fragrance which doesn't take away from any perfume I wear that day. Like as a Body Moisturizer!,Neutral
Pro's-You're getting a lot of product here. Used on my face and neck only this tub could easily last me well over  months-Pleasant smell. Not too cloying or perfumey-Mild and non-irritating. Keep in mind that I don't have super-sensitive skin though. Your results may vary-Absorbs into skin rather quicklyCon's-No plastic tab between product and lid which makes it a bit messy to use-Doesn't do anything special. My skin isn't glowing and I haven't noticed any dramatic improvements-Moisturizing properties are rather mild. If you have very dry skin it's probably not a good optionThis is good for people who want a lot of moisturizer for a cheap price. I bought this as an alternative to Oil of Olay etc. and I think I'm going to pay a bit more for the good stuff and use this as a body moisturizer. Decent for a A Budget Moisturizer,dry skin
I absolutely love this facial moisturizer. My skin absolutely drinks this up! I cannot speak to whether or not it does anything to correct wrinkles (I'm  and in the prevention phase!) :) but - I can say I will never use anything else on my skin. I use this every-single-day and my skin is smooth glowing and looks healthy. The product also smells really fresh - without smelling like there have been a lot of perfumes added.Smells good feels clean on the skin does exactly what you want out of a moisturizer - it's the best! Best Moisturizer Ever,Neutral
This stuff holds very well & lasts for several hours. However you will not need to wear any perfume cause this has a very strong fragrance. A nice citrus y scent that's just a bit overwhelming coming from my head. The weather's warming up & if someone decides to summon CANDYMAN I will definitely be under attack. Lol. So I'm gonna look for this in unscented. Hope you like BEES!,Neutral
Such a beautiful scent!  It smells exactly like the night blooming jasmine that grows all over southern california and on warm nights fragrants the air all over! This perfume even has a hint of the greenery.I love it and have also used it at bedtime because jasmine scent is known to help sleep. It works! I sleep all night after spraying this on me and / or pillowMy only issue which does not detract the stars is it does not last. I am sure I will need to get the cream and soap too which is next on my list along with many of Pacifica's other scents.If you like jasmine you will love this Smells just like rain kissed fresh jasmine,Neutral
This isn't the most long-lasting perfume I've ever worn but it's scent is lovely and delicate.  It's the perfect white floral scent-- not too complex and actually smells like a flower instead of an overly perfumey imitation of flowers. Love this soft scent,Neutral
This smells so good !spicy cocoa smell! I wanted something different from the fruity sweet candylike smells I usually get and this one is awesome. I sprayed it one time maybe an hour ago and I still smell it  I love that its different than anything I've ever smelled in a perfume and I can definitely smell the cocoa in it as one review said they couldn't smell anything chocolate about it its definitely there. But perfumes smell different on everyone &#; i think ill definately purchase this one again. love !,Neutral
I love Pacifica perfumes however this particular one is a bit too sweet for my taste. If you like a more subtle fragrance Pacifica Sandalwood is great! Too Sweet,Neutral
Tiny bottle of the loveliest smelling lilac perfume. I didn't realize I was ordering such a tiny bottle considering the price. Heavenly. Love the smell so REAL. But the bottle is tiny!,Neutral
I have bought this particular perfume x now. It smells a little like toasted coconut -- it's not quite sunscreen smell but it's close. I really like it because most people who have smelled it on me have called it &#;yummy&#;  -- which I like. It's playful and light. Probably good for a younger person. I recommend it though the scent lasts all day :D Yum!,Neutral
Very happy to find a Perfume that is not full of Bad Chemicals! AND....I Love Gardenia's....I gave it  stars...BUT it does not have a LID/Top to protect it from spraying....I ordered  of these. Very Happy except!,Neutral
This is a wonderful smell it's like I cut open an orange and was engulfed by that orange mist they spray out!  The scent stays on for about  hours with only  sprays so it could use a bit more staying power.A must have for orange lovers because it doesn't smell like cleaning product and the price is great for such a good smelling perfume. Fresh citrus,Neutral
This is a surprisingly &#;delicious&#; smelling perfume and I have lots of compliments every time I wear it.  Most perfumes are much more expensive and I can't wear many of them anyway because I'm usually allergic to some of the ingredients.  So this is a a very good relatively inexpensive alternative for me.  I first got it at Target which only had one promotion set up and then they stopped carrying it.  I'm on my third bottle and buy it from a vendor on Amazon and have been very pleased. A very nice perfume for the money that has become my favorite.,Neutral
I bought this perfume because it is a natural perfume and way better for you than normal perfumes. I love it. I have read in many reviews on different websites about Pacifica perfumes not having any staying power but I think this perfume lasts great for a natural perfume. The reason why it does not stay as long as we are used to (because we are used to chemical filled perfumes) is because it is all natural and does not have harmful chemicals in it that make other perfumes stay on your skin longer. This particular scent is great for summer. It is fun and sexy. I think it is great for all ages. I also purchased the Island Vanilla and am very pleased with that one as well. Great Natural Perfume!,Neutral
Lilac is really a hard flower to reproduce in perfume. I don't think I've ever smelt anything that comes close (Diorissimo does the whole Spring flower thing the best that I know of). This fragrance is only mediocre for me at the best. It wasn't very expensive and that seems obvious. But I've smelt worse. This only smells okay,Neutral
The best thing I can say is &#;This does not smell like perfume!&#; It does not have that old lady in the elevator smell. More like woodsy outdoor. Very nice. Does not overpower but doesn't last long. I will reorder this. Light scent,Neutral
I've been wearing this scent for about a year and I absolutely love it! It does not have a flowery or artificial perfume smell which is great. Rather it smells somewhat woody and citrusy (is citrusy a word?). I wear it because I personally love the smell but it seems other folks really like it too as I frequently have random people comment that I smell good when I wear it. It's not a heavy scent so you're not walking in a cloud of odor. Typically it is when someone is closer to me say in a crowded elevator or line that random people comment that it smells good. they pretty much need to be close to you so you don't have to worry that you're overpowering others with scent.I had been buying mine at whole foods but for some reason they've been out for over a month. I decided to check Amazon and found it here in addition to a few other scents by Pacifica that I think I'll give a try. I LOVE the scent of their Mexican cocoa candles so I'll likely give that one a try too. Love it - People frequently tell me I smell good when I wear this!,Neutral
Blood oranges in season around holiday time - they are so luscious and this was a gift for someone who loves the oranges I never knew there was a perfume but makes good sense since it has such a natural bright scent; what a find !!,Neutral
I purchased this scent at Amazon and really enjoy its fragrance. The problem is it doesn't last or hold up for any length of time so it's kind of fun when you first apply but by the time you go anywhere the lovely scent is gone. I might reorder and just use more or maybe I will find something else that has a more long-lasting affect. Pacifica Mediterranean Fig Perfume Smells Yummy But Doesn't Last,Neutral
I love the smell of this it is very sensual and light and lasts for a long time. Not overpowering at all I usually get headaches from perfumes but not this one. very good Smell,long time
This perfume smells great especially with the body butter. It lasts a little while but I spray it all over which uses up a lot I wish they made a larger size. I love this scent so much it's fantastic. Yummy,Neutral
I love this perfume. I wear the Malibu Lemon Blossom in spring and summer and the Spanish Amber in fall and winter. You do have to reapply throughout the day as there are no preservatives. I can't use commercial perfumes anymore because they smell strong and fake. (Hint: if you spray it on your clothing and/or hair the fragrance lasts longer) Wonderful Natural Perfume,Neutral
The ingredients list on the box is short and simple! I don't feel too bad about spraying this around my body like all other perfumes. It has a nice strong scent that lasts and it smells wonderful! It smells exactly how one would expect. Smells great!,Neutral
I've been wearing this perfume for the past  months...a small squirt lasts all day (albeit subtle by the end of an  hour shift). It is refreshing and an immediate pick me up to my mood! I've received many compliments with this perfume especially when combined with the undernotes of the mediterranean fig perfume from this company combined with this one. Perfume is funny it changes scents depending on the body chemistry of the person wearing it. For me this is one of the BEST perfumes out there (and it's much less toxic than most on the market this is pthalate free). Give it a try...the resale on ebay is high if you end up not liking it! Natural food stores sell this for % more than it costs on Amazon btw. Fresh crisp favorite!,Neutral
Here's the problem.  I spray it on and I can smell it.  I put it on all pulse points.  In less than  minutes it's literally  gone.My husband adores this scent so I did a sleepy time experiment.  He likes to spoon while we sleep so as I got ready for bed and I doused myself in Pacifica California Star Jasmine Spray Perfume; especially around the neck.By the time he had brushed his teeth and gone through his rituals and crawled into bed and cuddled up I waited. No response. I had to ask him if he noticed any fragrances; he said not really; just  your shampoo smell.Something is wrong here.I sprayed this on my sweaters hanging my closet and when I opened the door to closet an hour later I smell nothing.I have a great sense of smell.I'm going to experiment with jasmine essential oils mixed with a little orange oil and coconut oil.  I want to see if I can create something similar to this scent that will actually last.This is crazy. Perfumes are supposed to have a greater staying power than lesser scents. This has virtually none! I  have purchased this item  times from Wholefoods based on it's fantastic initial fragrance.,Neutral
If you're unsure of fruity scents or they are out of your norm scent wise don't shy from this one! I typically lean toward earthy scents but seeing that summer is (finally) approaching I decided to stray from my norm regarding scent preferences. I'm so glad I did. Pacifica is an awesome company period. They've yet to let me down. I love that the scents are fresh and light. They never feel heavy nor are they heady. I get headaches easily and suffer from migraines. Pacifica is one of the very few companies (other than Black Phoenix Alchemy Labs) that I can use without fear of head pain and nasal congestion. I feel *good* wearing their perfumes as one should.This particular scent--ruby Guava--is delicious. It's very juicy and sweet but not too sweet. It's not cloying at all. Despite being fruity there's a definite freshness to this aroma. I'm in love. This scent rounds out my top  Pacifica scents tying with Blood Orange: Island Vanilla Lilac Blood Orange and Ruby Guava. I can't recommend any of those scents enough subjective as fragrances go; sure you won't be disappointed. Gorgeous fruity scent,Neutral
This red is dark without looking brown and bright without looking pink or orange.  Sounds impossible but it looks red in a poorly lit room and vibrant in the sun.  It lightens dark hair beautifully and leaves your hair soft and smelling like the concentrated fruit oil included in the kit.  I wish I could buy a few gallons of that stuff for use as a deep conditioner and perfume.  It has amazing staying power in virgin hair and healthy treated hair much better than any other red I've used and I've tried them all from drug stores to Sally's to salons.  Feria used to be my go to with its vibrant reds but the last few times they've been flat dull and leave my hair feeling dry and straw like.  Garnier all the way!!! Best. Red. Ever!,Neutral
Belli Elasticity Belly Oil has just a few ingredients:Sweet Almont Oil Grapeseed Oil Lavender Oil Gotu Kola Extract Cocoa Butter Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)  Safflower Seed Oil Collagen Hydrolysates (Marine Derived).As a person with fairly sensitive skin I prefer simpler concoctions for my skin care which is one of the reasons I chose this product.I do know a thing or two about stretchmarks having been through a pregnancy that stretched my belly quite a bit- even though my son was a singleton due to excess amniotic fluid I was measuring  weeks when I delivered at ...Or to give you a more current reference- my belly was around the size of Kate's in Jon and Kate Plus .  Huge.  So my skin was stretched quite a bit... I knew from previous weight gains and losses that my skin is prone to stretch marks and pregnancy definitely delivered plenty more.From my understanding stretchmarks are not preventable- some women get them others do not...  But caring for your stretching belly skin is very important- even just for comfort as stretching and stretched pregnant bellies can be unbearably itchy. (some itching is cause for concern and I suggest a call to your midwife or doctor if you are getting itchy or rashy)There are a zillion formulas out there on how to sooth and pamper your stretching skin I don't think judging one because it didn't prevent stretchmarks is fair because nothing prevents them.I am not pregnant now but I still have a lovely hammock in front and I cannot afford plastic surgery or the downtime I do moisturize the belly skin and I find that certain formulas actually seem to make it look and feel less like an extra appendage and more like part of me.BELLI does that.  It comes in a generous oz glass bottle (I'm not crazy about glass in the bathroom but with various oils and essential oils plastic would probably contaminate or degrade too quickly) with a handy pump... It is oil so it is greasy when you first squirt it into your hand and rub it in... And then it's gone. The grease the oil is gone rapidly absorbed.  In it's wake it leave behind the softest silkiest skin.  Belli oil truly feels like a decadent splurge but also a responsible one due to the company's mission statement (a doctor made this for his wife keeping in mind the effect of skincare ingredients on a growing baby and mom) and the minimal ingredients.I would definitely suggest this to anyone not just pregnant women who would like a little simple at home pampering and is looking for a product to nourish stressed skin...I really like the gentle softness it gave my somewhat dry and very sensitive skin- my clothes slipped on without the wet grabbing that a not totally absorbed lotion can give...This absorbed so quickly that I was not greasy at all once I finished putting on my facial moisturizer and went to put my clothes on...Also if you do not like lavender at all you might want to steer clear of this...The lavender smells like a Bulgarian Lavender (more clean fresh and light and not perfumey) and it does fade shortly after application but if one has a sensitive nose (as is common in pregnancy) perhaps an unscented preparation would be best....I liked this best after a shower...It's easiest (for me) to incorporate this sort of thing in my regular routine... Minimal ingredients for an excellent product...,sensitive skin
I am going to come back and update this review after I give birth to my second daughter so I can tell you how well it worked. It's a bit oily which may be good for it working but makes it more difficult to want to put on. It has a slight perfume scent and I wish it did not but it's pleasant enough. The question is does it work? Will update in a month months! Seems nice,Neutral
Unfortunately I have no idea if this product is effective as I wasn't even able to make it through a single treatment. Here are the issues I experienced:. The puff was supposed to be wet thoroughly. When I did this it really didn't foam up and was running everywhere including into my eyes.. The puff has an extremely strong perfume scent. This is really a personal choice but I really don't like strong scents. Generally Neutrogena uses very mild scents but I found this to be very heavy.. The vibrations were really too much. I couldn't handle it even on the lowest setting. I finally just turned the thing off because it became very uncomfortable to use.I recommend sticking with your standard exfoliant or get professional treatments at a spa (which I've had and the vibrations didn't bother me there).  This product was very disappointing. Uncomfortable vibrations too strong scent runs into eyes,Neutral
I have psoriasis and my skin has not felt this good in years. I use it on my face too and it is wonderful.  I love it so much I look forward to taking a shower.  I love this soap it makes my skin feel wonderful.  It is true that it has a strong fragrance.  I am allergic to some smells and some strong perfumes but this doesn't bother me actually I like it although it is strong enough that it would interfere with a perfume.  I have used it in the morning applied no other fragrance and have had people ask me what perfume I was wearing and said it smelled good. I have psoriasis,Neutral
I fell asleep on this one by not reading the ingredients prior to ordering. Why would the seller put so many artificial and synthetic ingredients in with something as beneficial and natural as manuka honey. Before ordering this product check out the ingredients in the soap. I took off a star for the unnatural ingredients (one of them is perfume) and the small size of the soap. Otherwise you can detect the manuka honey in the smell of the soap and the moisturizing properties. Will NOT reorder. Dissappointed!,Neutral
Alberto Vo kiwi-lime squeeze clarifying shampoo works well when I shampoo my rapidly thinning hair in the shower! It feels comfortable as I massage it into my scalp and it takes what little hair I have left (!!!) and make it look its best.Unlike standard Vo shampoo that has both vitamins A and E in the formula this type of Alberto Vo shampoo only has vitamin D. On the other hand it has rosemary and lemongrass extract. I would have preferred the vitamin rich formula of the standard Vo along with the kiwi-lime effect of this clarifying shampoo. Nevertheless the ingredients in the formula still make it easy to work up a good lather when shampooing your hair with this shampoo.This brand of Vo shampoo has a mild scent to it. If you are allergic to scents or perfumes I would avoid using this product.I recommend Alberto Vo kiwi-lime clarifying shampoo for those of us who want to give ourselves an inexpensive treat for our hair when we wash it. It is safe for color treated hair too. It lasts a while so if you catch a sale on this stock up! good shampoo,Neutral
I can use very few products around my eyes because they are so sensitive to the ingredients or perfumes that are found in so many other products.  I've tried a number of different ones from Estee Lauder Lancme Clinique and a few others but none compare to this product.  I use this along with the Premier eye serum and it helps to reduce the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes. Great product especially for those with sensitive eyes!,great product
I bought this product because of the other positive reviews on it but am very disappointed at the very strong perfumey scent it has.  I have only used it once and cannot tell if it has had any effect on my hair as it does not seem any different than when I have used other shampoos but the smell is so strong and offensive to me (and my sinuses have been very uncomfortable) that I don't think I will be able to continue to use it.  I assumed that since it said it did not have so many chemicals in it that the scent would be a light natural not terribly noticeable one but I was wrong.  It has an awful lot of ingredients in it and although it says it has no Phthalates it is my understanding that if it says it has fragrance in it and a fragrance this strong it comes from Phthalates.  This might be a great shampoo if it were unscented or came in unscented or if they just toned the scent down and made it less perfumey smelling..  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone with the slightest sensitivity to scented products. Strong scent,Neutral
I have wore this fragrance a few time and I must say how much I enjoy it...The scent is probably not a date fragrance but it is great normal use cologne.  The scent is almost like a light baby powder scent that smells clean.  It is a little perfumey but not feminine.  What is wonderful about this cologne is that I can put it on in the morning and ten hours later I can still smell it on myself.  So if you are looking for a nice day use cologne this is it. The Essence of Clean,Neutral
Excelente perfume muy suave y fresco se puede usar de diario recibi el producto en el tiempo estimado lo recomiendo. Excelente,Neutral
I got this today and I haven't put it on yet but I can just tell by the smell from the bottle it's strong way stronger then la male it has a strong flowery smell to it not like a woman's perfume but like a strong blast of a flower guard but I like it better then la male so far a nice add on for me at least but that's just me I would say if you can get a simple be for you buy this Powerful,Neutral
I bought this perfume based solely on the glowing reviews it had already received and I'm adding mine to it!  I was hesitant to buy something without smelling it but for the price I decided to give it a try.  It's a wonderful fragrance a bit spicy still a little floral very contemporary.  The bottle is HUGE - it will easily last - months of even daily use.  My only issue has been with longevity -  after a few hours I can no longer smell it but that's easily remedied with another spritz.I'll be buying this one again. Love it!,Neutral
Awesome smell! love this perfume great price. Scent last a long time. Not fruity smelling a very trendy scent. Love this so much. It has lasted me a long time because you really don't have to use a lot! :) Will definitely re-order this. Amazing smell,long time
Smells so good =)  I am definitely going repurchase this scent for many years.  Perfume arrived on time and was packaged nicely =) Love this purfume,Neutral
Arrived very fast! I love this perfume and I most definately am going to be ordering another one. The smell is just wonderful and people compliment me when I am wearing it. Great smell!,Neutral
I love this fragrance and so does my husband but it doesn't last long.I wish they made it in a more concentrated perfume. LOVE the fragrance,Neutral
This perfume smells soooo good!! It's soft but has a sweet aroma. I love it!! how could anyone hate this perfume?? Unless your over  years old. But this perfume is defiantly for young girls and college girls. I'm in college and I love it!!! Wonderful! Smells Amazing Soft and Sweet!,Neutral
I totally disagree with the other reviewer.  I bought this perfume because Amazon offered it with free shipping and all  reviews were  stars.  Normally I wouldn't buy a perfume put out by KISS but when I saw the great reviews I figured why not?  I wore it today and several of the women I work with raved about how great it smells. Kiss for Her by Kiss,Neutral
I ordered this perfume based solely on the reviews. I was sooo wanting to like it. It smells very nice coming out and when I first have it on but the scent fades quickly and no one could even tell I was wearing a perfume at all. I have tried three different times and the same thing every time. It might work for you tho. But I was dissappointed. :{ just OK,Neutral
I like it this perfume smells nice it is sweet and nice smelling the package came in good condition and for the price paid it is worth it! my coworker loved the perfume on me so I gave her my full bottle of perfume and she wants more so I just ordered  more bottles one for me and one for her! smells really good!,Neutral
first of all i have prime and what should have been two day shipping turned into four days. then of course i opened it and sprayed the perfume to smell it. i wasn't impressed. when looking and the reviews i saw that one person said that it smelled like old lady perfume. and it does. i really wanted to like this stuff after reading all the good reviews on it. for me it smells ok if i spray it on clothes but it really stinks on my skin. i won't ever be ordering this again. i just hope i can stand the smell to be able to use all of it. it is a nice big bottle and it does look pretty cool. don't waste your money,Neutral
This item was shipped properly and packaged well.  The fragrance is very soft and lovely.  I liked the size of the bottle and the amount of perfume received for the price. This is a great buy!,Neutral
Una fragancia excelente que combina notas de vainilla. Me encant&oacute; este perfume lo compre por los  buenos comentarios de otros compradores y no me equivoque al pedirlo. A un precio asequible y razonable obtienes una fragancia inolvidable y que perdura todo el d&iacute;a. excelente perfume,Neutral
I tried to like it. But i just can't find something to like about this perfume. Maybe the chemistry with this perfume and my skin doesn't mix well like it can with other people who gave this perfume good reviews. But it smells like... A gross woodsy perfume that's cheap (well i mean the price IS pretty cheap ba-dum-psh). But yeah no I didn't like this. Buh,Neutral
I bought it because of the price ($.) and since the perfumes are like my weak spot I was like I must have it. I loved it!! and is so big. I have tons of perfumes but this is the one that I use the most for everyday and work. Kiss Her scent,Neutral
First I never take the time to review items online...I saw this perfume at a local clearance store for abt $....I actually smelled the tester as a joke wondering what the heck a Kiss scent would smell like...old Jewish guys from Brooklyn haha lol?? All I can say is WOW!!!!!  I cant really describe the scent its clean and sexy at the same time...reminds me of a combo of Issye Miyake and Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue....IMO Light Blue smells lemony but I dont detect any lemon/citrus in the Kiss...It its similar and BETTER than Issye Miyake...I get compliments all the time on this scent...men LOVE it!!!!  It's not floral and cloying...just fresh and sexy...I even use it at night cuz I love the fresh scent after my shower...It's so inexpensive and worth a try...I can almost guarantee you will love it young or mature What a Suprise!!!,Neutral
Someone recently gave me a bottle of Chanel No.  which I've not worn for at least  years. After using it again I won't let another  years go by without a # spritz! This classic floral perfume is a very high quality perfume; definitely representative of the quality that the house of Chanel exudes. The perfume is long lasting and a plus for me is that it doesn't react badly with my body chemistry which many perfumes seems to do. This perfume was developed in  and it is easy to see why almost a century later why it is still popular. A wonderful classic revisited,Neutral
This is a vaguely pleasant and old fashioned floral not as clean and bright as today's florals. Not as sweet. This is the stuff that was in my mom's drawer circa  which she never wore but I tried on several occasions. Honestly I found it boring and wondered what the whoopla about perfume was about. After all the musk and strawberry oil that we bought in little shops for  dollars really smelled good- why bother with this stuff? Many years later I can appreciate this perfume but personally I still find it boring. Of course I don't like gardenia. Fast forward some  years later when we had a revolution in perfumes many gorgeous and distinctive fragrances being introduced in the 's and ever since. Bottom line this is an aquired taste and is not for everybody. The main consideration here is the price which should deter most casual seekers. old fashioned not necessarily for old ladies,Neutral
I highly recommend this perfume.  The price was very reasonable compared to buying it at a department store.  It only takes a small amount each time you use it and it smells wonderful. Chanel No. ,Neutral
I purchased this as a gift for someone who is a lifelong fan of this perfume.  The price was right and the product did not disappoint. Sweet smell of success,Neutral
I first received Chanel No  as a Valentine's Day Gift from my then boyfriend now husband I figured any one with such great taste in perfume was the guy for me. That was thirty years ago. I loved the classic scent then and I still wear it today.I spray Chanel No  on in the morning and  the scent remains throughout the day.And the bottle I just love the bottle it is a work of art elegant and simple. Classic Elegance,Neutral
I got this perfume at a great price as it was an add on item. It smells awesome and I very happy to use it. I love addidas perfume.,Neutral
Pros: It smells good kind of a floral base mix with fruits and air freshener. So it smells 'clean'.Cons: It lasts  maybe  hours at best for me. So I would have to keep it in my purse and keep spraying every few hours to even smell any scent when I press my nose against where I last sprayed the perfume on my clothes. So you WILL go through the bottle fairly quickly. It might as well be a . ounce of regular long lasting perfume. But the . ounce is diluted and therefore it is not strong.Because of the price I say go buy a long lasting perfume or if you are okay with carrying the bottle around and okay with spraying yourself every now and then go for it!Best- Great smell light smell,Neutral
This fragrance is called &#;Floral Dream&#; for a reason --- It literally smells like you're walking through a garden! It smells very nice however it is just not the right smell for me. My sister is a floral fanatic so I decided to give this to her and she LOVES it. Would recommend for any other lovers of flowery perfume! Not my favorite but definitely worth the price.,Neutral
I am a big fan of non flower fragrances. I came across this spray  years ago and absolutely loved it. Recently I found that  of my my perfumes were running low. Perfect opportunity to buy a new one. I found Cold on Amazon and instantly placed the order. The product arrived before the estimated day in perfect condition. I love the fragrance. Not too bold but stays with you for the entire work day.Would recommend to anyone looking for a new fragrance to try. Love the fragrance,Neutral
he goes a little faster but the smell is actually a good perfume and does not smell bad like water is fresh and youthful perfect good,Neutral
okay.... we don't have &#;smellizon&#; (smell + amazon) yet so it's very hard to buy a perfume based on NEVER really hearing about it or smelling it... so I click &#;add to cart&#; strictly based on reviewer's comments from Amazon. The price was also exceptional too...  I'm so glad I did.  Love this new fragrance.  It's light with a gentle sweetness but definitely has a presence on you. Lasts all day. It&#;s not flowery or spicy&#; and it&#;s NOT obnoxious either. I've only had a few days so no compliments yet but I love it and enjoy wearing it and that's what counts. Wow... love this,Neutral
I BOUGHT INCANTO SHINE FROM NORDSTROM FOR ALMOST $. I RECOMMEND BUYING IT FROM AMAZON. I BOUGHT IT LAST JANUARY AND IT IS JANUARY THIS YEAR AND IT REALLY LASTS A LONG TIME. THE SMELL IS NOT OVER WHELMING LIKE MOST PERFUMES AND IT IS A CLEAN BUT A SMALL SWEET SMELL. I RECOMMEND BUYING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FROM AMAZON BECAUSE AMAZON HAS CHEAPEST PRICES. I LOVE& RECOMMEND THIS PERFUME,long time
This is the second Adidas Cologne that I have purchased for my self and I'm very impressed. I have yet to run into one from Adidas that I don't enjoy. The price for what you get is simple amazing! Applying a couple of sprays on in the morning will last a little over a half day which isn't bad at all at this price point.Like most Adidas colognes and perfumes there is definitely a very sporty fresh almost citrus type scent that I really enjoy. You can't go wrong with this purchase and you will save plenty of cash compared to buying from your local supplier. Highly recommended and I have no problems giving this one  Stars! Great Smell Great Price!,Neutral
My husband bought this for me one year for Christmas as a gift. It came with the shower gel and body lotion in a gift pack. I have been buying it ever since. I mainly use it in the winter because it has a heavier scent that I like to have in the colder months. I recomend this to anyone who likes a musk verses a flowery scent. winter perfume,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfumes and for the price you can't beat it. It smells fantastic (it's floral but not headache inducing) and it lasts many hours on my skin. A favorite!,Neutral
Jovan White Musk By Jovan For Women Cologne Spray .-Ounce BottleMy signature perfume.. I constantly get compliments & have been wearing it for years.. young & fresh My signature perfume..,Neutral
taking my money smelled soooo beautiful I had to ask what she was wearing. Jovan white musk! It's light w/ just a touch of musk and some very light flowers going on in there. It didn't bother me when I ate like some perfumes do and my husband said he could sill smell it long after the afternoon. I can't see anyone not loving this -- I'm very fussy about how I smell. :) EVERYWHERE. ;) I was checking out at Nordstroms a few years back and the woman...,Neutral
You cannot beat the value of Amazon's price.  If you love a light floral scent that has a hint of a summer breeze through palm trees and the fragrance of Hawaii this is for you.  I LOVE IT. this perfume transports you to paradise.  I love it!,Neutral
Perfumes are always a personal preference but I love this fresh scent. It has hints of honeysuckle and do remind of an island getaway. It is light enough to wear at work or all day. Island Perfume,Neutral
Having tried out the mens Adidas and liking the sporty smell for myself I decided to order this for my wife. The tricky thing is that she doesn't really like perfume but I thought it was worth the risk because of the price. She loves it and I also enjoy the smell on her! This one has that sporty fruity smell that I never get sick of. She puts it on once a day in the morning and it almost lasts the entire day. A good deal for something that lasts this long and smells this good at such a small price. She loves it and it smells excellent!,Neutral
This is an OKAY item. I continue to use it just not often. Not a LOVE scent that I thought I might like. I think after this purchase I will go back to buying my perfume at the store. It was a good price though. Im sure others would like this. Im just picky I guess. Perfume,Neutral
I purchased this at Gordman's a few years ago and every time I go back to the states (I'm in Iraq) I always remember to get some more!  I usually keep it in my glove box it fits perfect and I'm always getting compliments on it.  Although it is pretty cheap here on amazon you can get it cheaper if you have a Gordman's near you...I usually pay around $. for a bottle.  The blue bottle (not sure of the name) smells just as great.  If you forget to spray yourelf before you head off to work school etc this works perfect and actually stays on for awhile too.I highly recommend this!  Over here in Iraq you can buy cheap perfumes knock-offs for about $.-$. and even though they smell the same I think that they are a bit diluted so I am become accustomed to either buying online or spraying the crap out of it to get it to stay longer.  This helps me back home because I am so used to spraying myself so many times and I don't feel bad (or like I'm going to overdo it by using it too much.  Perfect light scent that lasts for quite awhile. Great stuff for the price!,Neutral
I bought this a few months back and I didnt think I would like it because I normally don't buy perfume online unless I know the fragrance. But this was awesome! Even when I cant smell it others seem to smell it and get ALOT of compliments! Very femine fresh outta the shower smell. love it...............,Neutral
I am just really getting into wearing perfumes at yrs old.  I have a very sensitive nose and the wrong perfume will cause my nostrils to flare which could be very painful. I use to think that I had to pay lots of money for the right perfumes because the saying: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. In this case it's not true. This perfume is very lightly scented. Everywhere I go I am sure to get compliments. People want to know what perfume I am wearing. This never happened with the expensive perfumes that I wear. I wash my clothes and the smell is still lightly scented in them. Everything about thisperfume it's pink bottle to it's scent makes me happy to be a woman. And I don't feel old when I wear it (Some perfumes have ancient looking bottles with pearls and flower tops). This perfume makes me feel young and fresh. Great Buy!!!,Neutral
This concoction is a fruity blend of Raspberry Musk Black Currant Sandalwood Freesia and Cyclamen (a type of flower).And I LOVE it~ but maybe I'm just a sucker for sweet perfumes . . . I'm not sure . . .Tips/Suggestions/Comments involving Fruity Rhythm:) First of all I think this fragrance is catered towards teens (perfect gift for your teenage daughter . .if you have one that is . . .) and it would be a little odd if an older person where to wear this . . .But that's just my opinion . . .) The scent strength is moderate . .Not too intense and not too subtle.) It lasts pretty long for a cheap perfume . .about  hours or so . .Perfect for a day at school) This is definitely a casual/daily use fragrance . . Not for special occasions Mmmm. Yummy~,Neutral
For the price I guess I can't really complain about this perfume. It doesn't smell strong at all - a little fruity but that's it. The smell doesn't linger for more than  minutes. It smells nice but nothing extraordinary just a clean fruity smell. I usually spray this on myself before going to bed. This is a nice perfume for the price but I've found the other Adidas perfumes to be much more satisfactory. Inexpensive perfume smells okay.,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfumes. I decided to buy my first perfume from Amazon and it was a great idea. I saved money and time! The wet smell of this perfume is completely different than the dry down. Make sure you try this before you purchase it. I thought that I wanted the toilette but when I compared them I loved the parfum!! This is slightly musky but still very feminine. lovely perfume!,Neutral
This is my scent of choice. I fell in love with this perfume! It gets better as you wear it and the scent gets nicer and stays with you throughout the day. I find that whenever I wear it I get tons of compliments on my perfume over other perfumes I wear day to day. Definitely worth the price! (: The Best!,Neutral
This product did not have anywhere on it that it was the real Pink Sugar by Aquolina.  It was an imposter perfume but did receive a full refund and an apology.  When working with the company please verify you are getting the real deal.  Very easy to work with even though it was not a good first experience. Received Refund,Neutral
This product is not all natural so don't let the name fool you others have listed the ingredients so I don't feel the need to repeat it. It contains mineral oil so it is very greasy it does absorb mostly into the skin but it still has a slightly greasy feel. There is too much perfume in it for my tastes.It does relieve dry skin but I have not seen any real imporvement in my skin so far (for wrinkles and fine lines). I think this may be good for someone with severly dry skin but don't expect miracles. not all natural and is a bit greasy,dry skin
This stuff smells very good. When I put it on I don't need anything else. No perfume nothing. I bought it on a friend's recommendation because I have a lot of raised and visible scarring on my arms. It's taken about  months but I am starting to see a bit of a difference. Not a lot but just a little. So yes I love this Bio-oil and will definitely buy it a rd time :) Smells good AND......,Neutral
I have to say I honestly don't know how well this product works because I only used it once. I couldn't get past the horrible perfume smell. It's very very strong. I know that smells are a matter of personal taste (and can also be affected by body chemistry) however to me it smelled like cheap perfume. After I liberally applied it to my pregnant belly I applied several other products to try to cover up the smell (I was unsuccessful and had to smell the stuff the rest of the day).Since the product has some lovely natural ingredients in it that have very pleasant scents on their own (like lavender and rosemary) why did they feel the need to cover that up with a cheap-smelling artificial scent?Also what does Red  do for scars or stretch marks? Nothing. What a pointless addition. I prefer my skin care products without extraneous ingredients and while the Red  isn't as big a deal as the perfume it's still really unnecessary.That being said I gave it two stars because the oil was moisturizing and very well may provide the benefits it claims. (However I have to note that I find the non greasy claim to be amusing. It's oil! Of course it's greasy.)Make sure you smell this before you buy it to see if you like the scent. Strong perfume smell,Neutral
I bought this product after doing tons of research on flat irons.  I was so paranoid that I would end up damaging my hair but loved the look that a flat iron achieved on my short prone to random waviness locks.  I've used the thermal guard almost every time I use the flat iron and my hair is in fantastic condition.  Granted I do let it go au natural on the weekends and whenever possible but still end up flat ironing at least three to four times a week.  On the days I don't use the thermal guard I notice that my hair seems frizzier and doesn't have the healthy bounce that usually accompanies heat styling.  While this product will never replace my beloved though discontinued Thermasilk Heat Guard due to its sticky texture that really only makes it suitable for direct heat applications its day-to-day performance ranks it as one of my styling Must Haves.  The only detractor...and it's a personal one...is the smell.  Others rave about its scent but I'm put off by the strong aroma of men's cologne or aftershave that this product has.  As such I always make sure to style my hair early in my morning routine so as to allow it to dissipate some before applying my own feminine perfume. Really does make a difference,Neutral
This is the one perfume that I stopped and smelled and loved it immediately. A few weeks later I recieved it as a birthday gift and I wear it everyday. daisy,Neutral
Smells really good. Light and fresh like well... a daisy would! Even tho daisies don't smell this perfume smells fun and like spring. It's more of a daytime perfume I think but I am sure it would be lovely for evening wear too. The bottle is adorable. One of the things that made me want to purchase this perfume. I opened the box up and went Awwwwwww when I saw it. Has an adorable array of daisies on the top of the lid. This would make a wonderful gift for any girly-girl's that you know. Mmmmmmmm,Neutral
This is a very light and fine mist that you put on your hair after it has dried; I tried to put it on my hair when it was wet and didn't notice too much of a difference. When it's dry like the directions tell you to use it though it works. Also it's important not to put too much in your hair - make sure to spray as far away from your hair as possible so the mist doesn't concentrate in one place and make your hair look greasy. The smell reminds me of strawberry candy or something. If you're bothered by strong smells or are afraid it'll clash with your perfume no worries - the smell fades pretty fast after application. So happy spraying! Makes Hair Slightly Shiny,Neutral
Omgoodness!! This stuff smells super ...i really love the fact that this perfume is a personal smell.. and whatbi mean is you have to get up close and personal to smell it.. i love that it dosent smell up the entire room with its gaudy smell.. or stiff smells.. its a great clean smell..works well with you natural body odor.. andbi mean for a few bucks to try..was well worth the buy! Will try other sex in the city scents soon... but for now im loving this smell! sex in the city: kiss,Neutral
It smells so good. I wear it for perfume & I know it also has health benefits.  I believe it's suppose to balance the body. Love it!,Neutral
This was a gift for my lady. She loves this perfume and now has added it to lineup. ff the reviews of others I made this purchase. Thank you everyone for your thoughts as it helped me make the right choice. I definitely recommend this product! Diamonds,Neutral
This is THEE perfume to have! I get more compliments on this one than I do any other fragrance I own and there's a reason for that. You spray it on just a few times and you are good to go. Its endurance is outstanding cause it lasts all day and all night. No need to carry it with you. The aroma is so sweet and relaxing and it makes you feel very feminine. I absolutely love this fragrance. It is my favorite to date. Gotta have it! Thee Perfume to Have!!!,Neutral
When I got this I wore it immediately & it smells great! Kind of like an oriental floral fragrance. Only bad thing is when I wear it I cough alot!! I have about  bottles of perfume and this is the ONLY one that does that to me. lol. Very nice!,Neutral
I wish I loved it I really do.The truth is that the smell is so powerful and sweet it smells like a teenage girl's perfume overload. I don't like it.Also it doen't feel like it's &#;silkening&#; anything. Maybe a bit of shine but for how much this costs? I don't know.I absolutely love Kenra products but this one isn't working for me.I find myself holding this product in one hand and Garnier Sleek and Shine Sleek Finish -In- Serum Spray for Sleek Finish in the other (the one I've had forever) and always ending up choosing the latter. It's just a shame really. The smell the smell I can't stand the smell,Neutral
My hair dresser uses it on me and I always get compliments when I use it.  It protects the hair from heat and smells like strawberries yet it compliments your perfume.  My daughter loves it. Great and smells great,Neutral
I like to remove my makeup before working out at the gym but who has time to actually wash their face?  I had been using the Neutrogena towelettes and although they never caused me any breakouts I thought they had a bit too much perfume and left a greasy feeling on my face and hands after use.  So I went looking for another brand to try.  After reading other reviews I decided to try these.  I'm glad I did.  I think these clean better than the others and are thick enough that if I use one side for the initial cleaning I can use the other side for a second pass.  After that there is not much makeup if any left!  These have a nice refreshing scent and do not leave an unpleasant residue on my face and hands after use. Great for a quick clean!,Neutral
While some celebrity perfumes smell really good I wasn't surprised when I smelled this one by Mariah Carey and found it to be extremely repulsive. I don't think I've ever smelled a fragrance so bad and certainly don't know how stores are able to sell this. Where one would expect something feminine and springy by looking at the purple bottle topped with a butterfly this fragrance actually smells like mold mixed with grandma's old musk that's been sitting in your attic for nearly two decades. As I sprayed this in Rite Aid I actually think I saw a few customers crinkling their noses with disgusted facial expressions. Would NEVER recommend this scent. This perfume smells disgusting.,Neutral
I was given this for Christmas and immediately started getting compliments. I will be buying this perfume for years Especially if amazon continues with those amazing prices! MARIAH IS THE BEST!,Neutral
I had previously had this perfume but missed it so much I knew I needed it again! Every time I wear it I get compliments and I have to be careful that my sister doesn't steal it away from me! It's a flirty/romantic/sweet smell not very spicy at all. A bit floral. Loooooove this perfume,Neutral
On my skin this perfume smells like sweet violet and marshmallow incense. It is more floral than I expected but I still enjoy it. I personally don't get any of the oceanic/aquatic/beachy notes I've heard others describe but it is a pretty sent nonetheless. Longevity could be better but at this price I'm okay with reapplying. Warm violets,Neutral
Unfortunately this perfume is simply sweet which is probably fine but it is only sweet and nothing else. It lacks the complexity of fragrances that are interesting. It would be a good first perfume for a  or  year old but I shall be donating my bottle to the local Salvation Army. generi,Neutral
I really grew to love this perfume.All I get is marshmallow...my favorite. And it's balsamic which I also love. It's not girly sweet in my opinion but a more mature fragrance. I will always have a bottle of this for as long as they keep making it. Love It!,Neutral
I have a love/hate relationship with celebrity perfumes.  I love lots of them (the Britney Spears one the Hilary Duff one several of J. Lo's) but I'm often not a huge fan of the celebrities involved.  And I'm not a huge Mariah Carey fan but given that I've enjoyed other celebrity perfume scents I was willing to give this a go.  Unfortunately I don't care for the scent any more than I care for Mariah Carey.  This smells like cake to me- cake with musky notes. The cake note are more prominent at first then it becomes more musky.  Cake and musk are just two things that (at least for me) should not go together.  If you like cake smells I'm sure this is great but cake is not very popular with me.  So I'm not very fond of this but foody fans might well like it. Food + Musk does not equal good,Neutral
I have the Oz bottle and looks so tiny cute. Perfect for my purse. The perfume last a lot and smell so femenine. Smell so good,Neutral
I generally like flowery scents so when I read the product description I thought I might like this perfume. It was offered as the goldbox deal so I surrendered to temptation. I must say that this is more of a spicy scent than a flowery scent. The fragrance notes reads: Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Amber Marshmallow Sea Breeze accord Patchouli Moroccan incense. I must say that I smell more of amber and Moroccan incense than anything else. Don't get me wrong it is still a nice scent. If I were to choose a reference to define the scent I would say that it reminds of bath & body works' rather spicier scents like sensual amber.I find the bottle and the overall representation a little bit childish but it's just me! Nice scent but a little bit different than I expected,little bit
I got this perfume for my birthday and I love it! The scent is sweet and girly. The bottle is very beautiful! I love purple and butterflies so the bottle is perfect for me. I would highly recommend this product to any lady who wants to smell sweet and sexy. I love this perfume!,Neutral
I don't care for celebrity perfumes. Mainly because they just seem like a gimmick to me. Slap a celebrity on a drug store perfume & it suddenly becomes dept. store price. So back when this first came out I thought the same thing. I first experienced it in a magazine. I saw it said it would have a marshmallow smell to it. Really? You can imagine my eye rolls at the time. I sniffed the sample & was pleasantly surprised. Sniffed it again... I think I like this. After a few more samples seen in magazines I wandered into a dept. store & tried it in the store... sold! I have been wearing it ever since every day work or play. It has become my signature scent & I get complimented all the time from women of various ages. I was even getting coffee one morning & the lady working there was stocking the coffee bar next to me & stopped to ask what I was wearing. This is the only downfall. I'm not really a Mariah fan so when people ask me what I am wearing & I have to respond Mariah Carey's perfume M I also feel the need to explain I don't usually care for celebrity perfumes I'm not a big fan of Mariah... etc etc. So I guess you could say I wear it with a disclaimer. Overall the scent is light sweet but not overly so with touches of floral. It's very feminine but not in a bubblegum teen kind of way. I have allergies & can't take overbearing perfumes that are musky etc. This works great for me! I ran out  days ago and was using little tester samples I had of other perfumes I kind of liked & couldn't stand it anymore & ran out to get another bottle of this so I guess you could say I am addicted. A side note I have tried all of Mariah's other perfumes & don't like any of them. Addicted to M,Neutral
This perfume smells great on me.  I had purchased a tester a few months back and decided to try it last week.  I love the way it mixes with my body chemistry.  It starts out sweet but then settles down into a very feminine fragrance light and refreshing. Danielle Steel Parfum for Women,Neutral
excellent productreceived in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to BUY IT GO AHEAD  its an original perfume .Higly recommended real one!,Neutral
The smell lasts a long time!!!!!My husband wears this perfume and I absolutely love it. Sometimes the smell lingers on to my clothes as well and can last a long time. This perfume is definitely a win-win situation. A great smell that lasts! Lasts a long time,long time
I bought this scent because of the great reviews on amazon and boy it did not disappoint. This perfume smells great you can smell  hints of rose orange blossom vanilla and lily. The scent is very femine and more on the sweet side and it do last all day. I have gotten so many compliments every time  I wear this scent people would ask me what perfume are you wearing. It is suitable for all ages try it you might like it and the price is very reasonable. I am giving these as gifts for christmas. lovely scent to smell,Neutral
It smells like a bouquet of flowers when you first apply it. I like it more when it dies down because its a little strong at first. First base lasts around  minutes and the second layer of the scent is the part that I like its more soft and gentle it smells very casual. This fragrance is more of a spring/early summer scent (daytime scent). My mom loves this perfume she said it smells lovely and it smells like it would be worn for women also. Like I said very casual and also pretty. The only thing that I disliked was the bottle and how the sticker is. Its a huge bottle (. OZ) and its a tiny sticker on a bulky glass bottle. I took mine off. Its worth the  bucks. (My seller was: FragranceNet) I like the dry down of it.,Neutral
Of all the perfumes I own I find myself wearing this one almost every day. Not too overpowering but it is long-lasting. A very slight hint of the smell of sunscreen in this scent. It's definitely unique. It doesn't have those floral or vanilla scents that so many perfumes use at their base. I'd say go and try this one out. Sophisticated different refreshing. I wear this every day.,Neutral
This is a famous fragrance created by a perfume genius - Francois Coty . It was later copied and tweaked by Jacque Guerlain in the form of the EXPEN$IVE L'Heure Blue . Lheure Blue is still sold at Neiman Marcus and is universally admired . Recently  I sampled L'heure Blue ( Neimans ) and then decided to order L'origan after reading perfume reviews at several sites online. Frankly  I was let down by L'heure Blue and found it cold and flat and was puzzled by its popularity . When I received the bottle of L'Origan I was not expecting to like it - . What a surprise ! L'Origan is BEAUTIFUL ! I now understand why the reviewers praise it . The perfume is amazingly FEMININE . It is a soft spicy oriental and combines orange blossom vanilla and spices . To my nose it smells somewhat similar to Tresor with a dash of orange blossom . The amazing quality I notice is that this fragrance is basically SOFT  yet lasts forever - it has perfect projection - not overwhelming yet softly makes itself known in an unintrusive fashion. This is one of the most womanly perfumes I have ever smelled - ladylike  soft  classic and yet not dull or flat .I think this could be a great fragrance for ANY occasion or any age . ONLY A CLASSIC can be that versatile .Incidentally  this perfume is the fragrance used to scent Coty face powder  the kind that sat on my Grandma's vanity . Even though it was created over  years ago  it does not at all smell like an old lady . If you try it  I doubt you will regret it . Best of all  the price for the quality defies logic . Monsieur Coty was a creative genius  and L'Origan is a lovely testimony to his skill . There are hundreds of hot sellers that do not smell half as good  and disappear shortly after $praying .I will proudly put this on the shelf next to my Dior Addict  Dior Hypnotic Poison and Coco Chanel ! Created By Francois Coty In  - A Genuine Timeless Classi,Neutral
The reviews made me expect a little more. It has a very traditional sweet and spicy smell-- the kind women used to wear  years back. I think my mother would love it but I belong to a different generation and L'Origan reminds me of old closets and clothes smelling of old perfumes. It's not bad but also not something Iwould  want to wear. Okay but not as nice as expected,Neutral
Love this perfume in the summer.  Soft smell and reasonable price.  I recommend it to anyone looking for something not too expensive and smells yummy.Great product! PalLagunaNiguel,Neutral
I almost cried in the department store when they told me this had been discontinued.  It is by far the best perfume I have ever worn.  It has a deep strong woodsy floral smell (one squirt is enough for me).  I really hope CK brings this one back.  It's much better than the newer Euphoria or CK one. My favorite smell,Neutral
myn ex boyfriend introduced me to this perfume and so i bought it. its good and smells really good all my friend s love it nice,Neutral
Lilies of the Valley  as small as they are  have a lovely scent.  it's captured very well in this light summery cologne.  It is not too strong a very delicate perfume.  Try it! Lily of the Valley cologne,Neutral
I love this perfume. My mother used to let me wear it on special occasions when I was a kid so to me it smells like Christmas and birthdays.It's a clean and feminine smell. I'm glad they still make it! So girly and nostalgic.,Neutral
This Coty perfume is a classic.  It's simple and pretty and should be in every woman's perfume wardrobe.  A great first perfume for a teen or pre-teen girl too. classic lily of the valley scent,Neutral
There's a reason that this has been in production for decades. Even master french perfumers acknowledge this as THE standard for Lily of the Valley scents. Classic perfume,Neutral
Wow -- love this perfume! It's the best lily of the valley that I own. And the price is so good for such a sweet scent. I only wish it lasted longer. Plus I wish Coty would bring back the powder with puff (what a sumptuous experience). I have a little bit left from many many years ago. It's a treasure that I've kept tucked away for special occasions only. Oh please bring it back Coty! Heavenly!,little bit
Muguet Des Bois By Coty For Women. Cologne...my boyfriend liked this one over the perfume called Lucky that I purchased at the same time it has a nice floral scent.  I still like Romance and the Beautiful for floral scents but I still have much more to try since I don't buy too many. Muguet Des Bois By Coty For Women. Cologne...,Neutral
My mom loves the lilly of the valley and it's about impossible to find this old fashioned pure lilly of the valley smell at a reasonable price. Probably not something you want to wear unless you are  though. Otherwise very true-to-flower-smell perfume no other notes in it. Old fashioned perfume...,Neutral
I love Lily of the Valley. This is a seriously watered down version of a glorious scent. But at / the price of other lily of the valley perfumes you can't go wrong. A bit blah.,Neutral
Smells so good.  A little over powering but it fades a little faster than I'd like.  I gave it four stars because it fades fast and because the bottle came bubble wrapped without a box.  I don't know if that's normal.  I'm used to perfume coming in a box Smells just like lily of the valley,Neutral
I have always loved the scent of lilly of the valley so went on a search for a perfume with this scent. The search brought me to this all time favorite. From the reviews I have read it has been around for quite some time(reason I bought it)and has been loved by people for many years. The scent is pure clean and spring time in a bottle. The reason why I gave it  stars instead of  is the scent doesn't last that long. Still love it and its cheap enough to keep in your purse and spritz throughout the day. smells wonderful!!!,Neutral
I have been using Dolce & Gabbana The One for a couple of years now.  I just finished my second . ounce bottle.  I wear it every day and get a lot of You smell good! compliments from both men and women.  I'm not big on floral perfumes but this one is light and is balanced by fruit scents.  I'll continue to buy this scent as long as they're making it. Perfect scent for me,Neutral
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this scent is for the older more mature woman.  I purchased this perfume thinking that because it was Dolce and Gabbana I was going to like it.  NOT.  It is a musky heavy cloying scent that makes me nauseous.  I didn't know what it smelled like before I purchased it so I guess I'll have to take this hit.  I've smelled this scent before and it smells like Ralph Lauren's old perfume Safari.  All these perfumes are just a recycled version of another perfume.  I like crisp clean scents and this is not that.  If you like amber musky heavy &#;old lady&#; perfumes or the scent of the bottom of your grandmas purse then you will love this. Bottom of Grandmas Purse,Neutral
I had heared a lot about the perfume on Amazon and so i decided to buy this at macys since i dont like to get into anythin new without the gurantee that i will like it and go thru the return hassles.Anyways Its obviously pricey but it does give a good smell. I agree with the previous reviewer that the smell doesnt last that much though.The smell is not very light and so it is more of a winter wear than summer wear but it is a classic smell so it may not be appropriate for the young. I would recommend starting it sometimes after .On and on not bad but buying it again...............i will have second thoughts Need to develop a liking!,Neutral
I love this perfume.  It last and depending on your body chemistry it will not smell the same on everybody.  I would recommend this product to all the ladies that like to get the question asked What are you wearing? It's Great!,Neutral
A little pricey - but worth every penny not to smell like a - well you know.  I discovered this at the beauty salon in one of those foldouts in  magazine - and first sent off on e-bay for a small sample.  Loved it so much I came here and bought the full size.  Good perfume that matches your body chemistry is hard to find! OMG - Awesome,Neutral
* I love this perfume a women complimented me and my boyfriend likes it!* Now I want the Rose The One!* The scent does not last long enough though... I love this perfume a women complimented me and my boyfriend likes it!,Neutral
I wasn't impressed by this fragrance. It's a blend of floral/amber/vanilla/musk which is an interesting combination but also smells sort of masculine to me which is probably why I don't like it. Also the perfume has poor staying power. There are better fragrances out there. Not the one for me,Neutral
it's my favourite perfume ever!!I just love it and I always wear it and I always smell great :) Love it,Neutral
My boyfriend bought me this perfume for my birthday and I absolutely love it. It is definitely a strong sexy fragrance.  I always get asked what I am wearing when I have it on.It is really intoxicating without being overwhelming. It will last for several hours too which is not common of most perfumes.  You really can't go wrong with the fragance!  I plan to also buy the lotion for a softer version of the fragrance during the day. birthday gift,Neutral
I bought D & G The One because I thought it was just too irresistible. My opinions did not last long though because after a while it became very unbearable not bad to wear just not what I like in a perfume. Mom looooooves it though so there....she gets it :D Average!!,Neutral
Great perfume for women. I bought this as a gift to my stepsister a few years back and she loves it. Now I don't know why I spent money on her. Because her mother is a whore and so is she and they all grew up in a ghetto a$$ village. Dulce & Gabban,Neutral
I bought this bottle for a friend. She almost fainted when she saw the price. She couldn't believe what a great value on this perfume. In the local stores they sell this for twice as much than on amazon. Bought for a friend.,Neutral
I tried this perfume in a store once and decided to buy online; however the fragrance happened to be not as good as I remembered it from the store. I prefer lighter and fresher scent OK,Neutral
I got this perfume very quick and to tell you the truth I never smelled such a beautiful scent nobody I know has this perfume so this item is awsome for me! Like wow!,Neutral
This perfume is exactly like the musk oil from years ago. Oil stays on your skin for a long time without losing its scent. Awesome!,long time
Grandma Shirley loves this perfume and the oil really lasts a long time and she smells great in this she looks forward to getting this every Chrismas! Grandmas Favorite!,long time
I've been using Revlon ColorStay Pressed Powder with SoftFlex for quite some time now. This does not cause my naturally sensitive combination/oily skin to break out or get irritated. There is no perfumey smell which is important to me as I am sensitve to many scents. The coverage is medium to heavy-medium depending on how you apply it. If you use a fluff brush to apply it the coverage is light to medium. However if you press it in with the included (flat) puff your coverage is going to be heavier.My skin tone varies from very light in the winter months to a medium tan in the summer (depending on sun exposure). I have used several shades of this over the years and have never experienced any orangey/unnatural tones with this product. This has good pigment is finer-grained than most compact powders and is a fantastic pressed powder for the price.It wears well is matte helps prevent shine better than other more expensive brands I've used and lasts pretty well throughout my longer days (although I do blot my face with a tissue as needed and touch up a bit with a brush once or twice during the day/evening).It is important to note that the newer compacts (seems like this change started in  IF my memory serves me well) -no longer have the full mirror just a small sliver of a mirror inside the cover which is virtually useless. For that reason I'm taking a star off an otherwise  star product for the price point. Despite the mirror issue it's a great powder for a good price and I recommend this compact powder. Great Powder Tiny Mirror,Neutral
I've been using cotton candy mist so I figured this would smell the same and last longer. Unfortunately this perfume smells weird... It smells sweet yet it has that overwhelming cheap perfume smell... Smells funny...,Neutral
I wear cotton candy spray because it smells delicious and because people are just nicer to you when you smell like it. I actually wrote a paper for my psych class on how people let you check out first daycare workers are more hands on with a toddler who smells like cotton candy etc and on how it engages people. It started out as an experiment and is now my preferred perfume.In case you are wondering sugar cookie scent and apple pie were the # & # scent that had similar though not as pronounced results in my  day experiment. French vanilla and lavender had the worst results with people grumbling about &#;strong smells&#; and being standoffish. love,Neutral
I'm doing another reviewer one star better and calling this perfume 'great'.  For such a simple formula this smells really good and has lasted a good  hours on me.  Apparently the sweet scents agree with me and this one is inexpensive to boot. Cotton candy and fruitvery pleasing. Great,Neutral
Kiss My Face products have always impressed me so I keep trying more. Their Honey & Calendula Ultra Moisturizer is one of my favorites for dry weather. This is a silky cream that absorbs fairly well. At times it doesn't absorb as fast if you use too much so less is more in this case. The ingredients include:Water Stearic Acid Coconut Oil Isoprpyl Myristate Glycerin Glyceryl Stearate PEG- Stearate Grape Seed Oil Cetyl Alcohol Coco-Caprylate Aloe Leaf Juice Honey Calendula Flower Extract Matricaria Flower Extract Sage Leaf Extract Yarrow Extract Orange Flower Extract Lavender Extract Sambucus Nigra Flower Extract Fennel Fruit Extract Panthenol Tocopheryl Acetate Retinyl Palmitate Xanthan Gum Perfume Tromethamine Tetrasodium EDTA Phenoxyethanol Caprylyl Glycol Potassium SorbateSorbic Acid Linalool essential oils.While this is a fairly comprehensive list of ingredients the essential oils stand out as wise choices. They delicately scent this cream and along with honey this is a very fragrant lotion. One application lasts  hours and this makes it a favorite.~The Rebecca Review Works well in the winter...,Neutral
No oily residue no stinky perfumes and my skin feels hydrated. I use it on face and body. It works well under makeup - no breakouts and my skin feels soft and comfortable winter and summer. Great for dry skin,dry skin
My review title pretty  much sums up how I felt about this shampoo. It smells OK in the bottle but once it's in your hair it kinda smells like your grandma's perfume tray from the s. It's an odd amalgamation of smells.The shampoo I found is hard to wash out of your hair. My hair felt fuller but that's probably because there was still residue in my hair. According to the bottle it says to lather rinse and repeat. Why would I wash my hair twice?Also I noted after I got this it's for black hair. I'm white. Ooops! LOL Funky smell hard to wash out of hair,Neutral
I was a little worried that I would not like this conditioning shampoo because the bottle says it's for medium to course hair.  However it really shampooed and conditioned my fine hair well. Although running a comb through my wet hair was not as smooth as when I put in conditioner it was still pretty easy. There was no perfume scent that I could detect yet my hair was left fresh smelling and bouncier than I expected. In addition after my hair dried it was not flat which is typical of an hair that was overconditioned.I really like this for the times I don't want to bother with carrying both shampoo and conditioner such as when I shower at the gym.  Since it worked so well on my fine hair I wonder if it conditions enough for the medium and coarse hair types. I would certainly consider buying this overPert Plus in Shampoo + Conditioner medium for normal hair .-Ounce Bottles (Pack of )because when I tried Pert it left my hair lifeless and this one does not. Nice for my fine hair too even though it's rated for medium to coarse hair,Neutral
This is a good all purpose shampoo.  My hair is relaxed and tends to be dry so I have problems with some shampoos making it feel stripped and brittle.  I didn't have that problem with this shampoo.  I like the smell and I didn't notice it lingering or interfering with my perfume.  My hair felt soft and smooth.  It lathered well and didn't have to do any extra work to get my hair clean.  I still prefer to use a leave in conditioner in addition to this but I probably would recommend this shampoo. Good all purpose shampoo,Neutral
While this product may be advertised for the hair of women of color it is simply amazing if you fight with fine hair. I've searched for years to find a product that will give body without crispiness volume without tons of product and hold without using the whole bottle. I read about this in More magazine as something that they recommended for older women who are experiencing thinning hair or have fine to very fine hair.Use this on damp hair before blow drying for wonderful body. If your hair has any wave to it this will amp it up without it feeling like your hair is untouchable. I can put my hair up in a clip or ponytail older and let it back down with no loss of volume or waves. Use this on dried hair before setting in hot rollers or using a curling iron/wand for curls that actually last more than an hour! There's no weigh-down with this product at all. It also helps control my frizz including during humid weather. I do use hairspray to set my hair once done but not as much as I used to. I'm left with shiny hair lots of movement and lasting style. I've not tried this with a flatiron but with the success I've had with waves and curls I have no doubt this would work great.As for washing your hair this stuff comes out easily. It's nice not having any feeling of residue on hair or having to wash it two or three times to get gunky product out. If you do go a couple days between hair washes try restyling a section before adding more product. If you do add more keep it as little as possible. I noticed that using too much can leave hair feeling a bit gunky.The only issue I have with this product is the scent. It doesn't last which is good but you might want to apply any perfume before using this or else you might end up using too much perfume to cover up the scent of this product in your hair. Other than that this foam is utterly amazing. Amazing for fine hair,Neutral
First let me say that I am not a professional when it comes to wrapping my hair.  I cleaned and conditioned my hair with Silk Elements products that I normally use then I followed the instructions on the wrap lotion and set my hair.  I did like the light sheen that it gave my hair but that was about all I noticed.  I don't particularly like the scent.  It goes away after awhile but I just don't like to have pronounced scents in my hair.  I think that it might smell funny with some perfumes.  I tried the product several times and I found that it needs to be clean every time you use it or you can get a bit of build up.  Some products do not react the same in my hair as they do others.  As with all hair products this is one that might be worth trying but I would not recommend this. Nothing special,Neutral
My daughter and I used this product three times to put to a test since we both have extremely dry hair and scalp from the excessive heat in Arizona with a combination of skin allergies. We were pleased that it is gentle on the scalp leaving no irritations. In addition it leaves hair silky shiny and has a pleasant fragrance. Neither one of us like conditioners that are too harsh in fragrance sometimes as strong as perfume.  Furthermore we only used a little after each shampoo. The results left hair free from feeling and looking oily and  our dry scalps felt better along with our hair feeling clean. Also I like the idea that one bottle will last a long time especially in this challenging economy. We are both content and we certainly will continue to use this Moisture Plus Conditioner. Highly recommended! IT PASSED THE ULTIMATE TEST!,long time
I usually use a shampoo/conditioner combo product in order to save water money and time but sometimes like to use a separate conditioner after shampooing.  I think this product did a good job.The scent is barely noticeable which I highly prefer.  I can get queasy after smelling a strong perfumed smell left on my hair by a conditioner.  This product is absolutely wonderful in having very little detectable scent.I only used a small dollop and it seemed to condition my hair just fine.  I was able to comb it out while wet very easily.  After blow-drying my hair had no static fly-away (it's the middle of a cold dry winter right now) and it felt soft enough.  It didn't make my hair shine extremely brightly like in those stupid hair conditioner commercials but I'm happy with it.Also I like that the bottle sits upside down insuring that you get every bit of it out of the bottle.  I even add a little warm water to the nearly empty bottle to get the last traces of conditioner before replacing it with a fresh bottle. Motions at Home Moister Plus Conditioner,Neutral
This conditioner did not leave the hair soft and silky but rather thick-feeling and heavy. There was no noticeable difference in the shine. A plus is that the scent is very neutral neither perfumed nor chemical.Definitely disappointed in this conditioner and would not buy it. Did not leave hair soft,Neutral
The Motions hair product line is developed and targeted to cater to the African ethnic hair needs.  In my case I'm white but with graying hair that is often dry especially in the winter months.  I gave this moisturizing conditioner a try.  Results? . . . .Right out of the bottle I knew immediately that this is a serious high performance conditioner and not a watered down hair perfume.  The consistency is very heavy and even feels greasy as one applies it (not to worry it will rinse clean).  The odor is not at all perfumed and borders on the unpleasant though tolerable.If you get any runoff into your mouth you will know it immediately . . . you lips/tongue/gums where exposed will feel very dry. Not a big deal and water flushing rinses away the problem but it's very noticable. Based on that experience I will heed the label warning to avoid contact with eyes (I didn't have any problems).After use results were good.  My dry and rather thin strand hair is cut medium short into a a brush cut an inch or two long.  The Motions Moiture/Conditioner added body (thickness) and a nice clean-looking straight healthy look.  An obvious improvement from some of the mass marketed conditioners that smell good but don't have a lot of residual benefit after drying.  I deducted a star for the odor. Serious strength.  Very good results.,Neutral
Feels much like I just had a hot oil treatment.Uses primarily mineral oil but also Jojoba avocado oil wheat germ oil & vitamins to treat dry hair.A bit too much mineral oil for my taste - the reason it didn't get  stars. It stays on top of hair.A good treatment to use once in a while.Scent has a hint of avocado & a bit perfume-like but not overpowering.May need to treat  drier ends of hair more than twice or allow to stay on longer to have oil treatment stay. My ends were still dry.Nice to discover a product that is inexpensive and can be used regularly to keep hair from breaking. Feels like hair hydrated even a bit oily,Neutral
I used this product for the last five weekends at an event where I needed to tame my very curly and at times frizzy hair into a smooth style and it worked very well lasting pretty much all day. It does not have a strong heavy perfume odor which is also a big plus for me. About the only reason I gave it  stars was because I really did not see any kind of shimmer effect in my hair color although I was not really looking for that in this product. But if a product says it will have some kind of effect it should deliver that. I have a dark red hair though so maybe it works better to create a shine on lighter hair.Over all a great product for holding very curly and somewhat frizzy hair in a specific style for many hours so I would still recommend it. Works great on curly hair.,great product
This wonderful pomade gives my hair just the right amount of control with no stiffness and adds a beautiful natural sheen making my long (many years old) hair look fresh and young again. Also it has no heavy scent to clash with my perfume. Not your usual stuff!,Neutral
For years I've been hearing about all these women who supposedly only wash their hair once per week and how lush and thick their locks become from all the natural oils. I have a lot of smooth fine hair and as my grandmother always used to say it's 'straight as a poker'. If I skip one day of washing my hair my hair starts to hang in wet-looking strings of grease.I've tried some aerosol dry shampoos in the past includingBig Sexy Hair Volumizing Dry Shampoo Sexy Hair . oz Shampoo For UnisexandOjon Full Detox(tm) Rub-Out(tm) Dry Cleansing Spray . ozand ended up with white clumps from spraying too close for too long grease streaks and white probably toxic powder all over my bedroom. My scalp also FELT dirty because there was so much powdery residue on it. It almost felt worse than not using anything.Enter Pronto! The squeeze tube for me at least seems to give better control in terms of application and the results are amazing! My hair looks full and clean and it even feels clean! I also really like the smell. It's a pleasant but not too strong perfumed scent.As per the review mentioning toxicity I checked the Environmental working group's site and this product is actually a '' on the - scale. That's not great but it's not super toxic either. I will look for an alternative product that is on the very low end of the scale but I'm hoping that light use of this product won't have any negative health effects relative to things like sunscreen which almost always seems to fall in the  toxicity range with just a few exceptions. This is a powder though and we probably breathe some in when applying so it is something to consider. The only dry shampoo I've ever tried that works,Neutral
I recently went cold turkey on all my old products that had Parabens in it BHT BHA etc etc (the list is long). It was my new year's resolution to reduce the chemicals I expose my body to. So anything that wasn't primarily all-natural or was higher then a - on skin deep's website went in the trash. Even some of my cosmetics sadly.When I went looking for new products I really made an effort to be a conscious consumer read hundred of reviews googled etc etc. I scoured amazon all day (sad but true) in search of a new body wash body lotion face wash etc etc.When I stumbled across this product what sold me on it was . the price it was less than $ dollars. Which is much cheaper then Khiel's and other high end body washes. . That it had honey in it. In doing a lot of reading on ingredients I've come to learn Honey really is a special and unique substance. I wont make this review long but do your homework on it and other ingredients first. (Note: before this year I would just buy any product that was high rated in my favorite magazines and was a negligent consumer). . It has a oil in it which is great b/c it pulls out other oils and impurities out of your pores when lathered on in a steamy shower. . The ingredients are certified organic and are; Cocoamidepropyl Betaine (Coconut oil soap) Decyl Glucoside (Sugar beets) Lauroyl Lactylate (Palm Kernel) Deionized water Butyrospermum Parkii (shea butter) Honey Apricot Seed oil Black seed oil Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower extract Essential oil blend. . It smells WONDERFUL. Upon receiving it I immediately went to smell it and fell in love. It really is a unique smell. I can smell the honey but the black seed really makes this smell great! (King Tutankhamen was a smart man then again the Egyptians were a brilliant civilization).In sum I am sold on this for life. It leaves my skin soft hydrated and clean. I wish it came in a spray perfume. They have the lotion which is what I plan on purchasing next. However I do love the other new lotions I bought (which I also reviewed) but this is my favorite scent in a bath product ever. Glad I found this and am sold for life!! Love love love this body wash!!!!!,Neutral
If you want the nice silky smooth hair after a shower get this!  It is amazing.  My mom who has thin brittle hair has used this mask for years.  It smells good as most hair products smell (not like a strong perfume).  The jar is made for you to be able to flip the lid instead of having to twist open the cap and risk dropping it in the shower and all.  This is not the most expensive hair mask but it's definitely more expensive than most hair masks you find in a local drugstore but it is worth it! One of the best,Neutral
I purchased the deep conditioner previously and wanted to try the hair mask and scalp treatment.  As expected another great  product!  Makes a noticeable difference to my hair and makes a sheen that my hair never had before.  It also doesn't have any heavy perfume smells that other hair products have but certainly makes a difference when used regularly. Another Great  Product!,great product
Marc Anthony True Professional Strictly Curls Curl Defining Lotion  is a mid-priced product that works relatively well: my curly-haired niece gave me a tube to try.  The product claims to have been perfected by world champion hair stylist Marc Anthony whoever he is when he's at home and enriched with Silk Protein and Vitamin E: so that it claims to be able to eliminate frizz and repel humidity.  Well I don't know about that but it will give those of us who are curly-haired a look we can live with without frizz generally for at least a day -- me  it gives a head of small pretty defined curls.  And that's the best I can hope for in the long hot humid local summers when every day is a bad hair day.  I've found no hair product that holds for more than a day and I do seem to remember that on the very worst days my hair with this product might actually not have made it until sundown. The product is alcohol-free is made without animal testing -- a very important qualification to me and is made in Canada.  The product has a pleasant aroma to which it seems I'm not allergic and I'm allergic to so many perfumed things.  It is reasonably easy to use just put some in your hand and scrunch through your hair.  Mind you it does suggest the utilization of a hair dryer which is much too damaging to the hair to be used daily particularly in these hot summers if you ask me.

I'm happy to finally found lotion that doesn't contain harmful chemicals that moisturizes well but not waxy greasy or sticky. The only con is the smell. I like the smell of coco butter butAlba Cocoa Butter Hand and Body Lotion  Ounceis very strong and can be overwhelming. I can't use this in the morning because it makes it impossible to wear perfume. I was looking to change to fragrance free Alba but reading the recent reviews it was disappointing since they changed to the new formula. Almost Perfect,Neutral
This is a wonderful value. Beauty treatments in a salon are so expensive and so this gift of a way to really condition your hair at home properly is terrific! Saves money time and is nice to have on hand to use if you have a big event coming up and you need your hair to look your best fast without the cost. This conditioner is easy to apply has a fresh scent that did not fight with my perfume when I experimented and used a bit after washing just on the tips of my hair to moisterize as a fast leave in conditioner. I like everything I have tried from Motions so far and will continue to use their products. Wonderful value,Neutral
I only used this product once because I did not care for the fragrance. I am sensitive to many perfumes and this product made me wrinkle my nose. This is not a desirable quality in a beauty product; wrinkling and nose-twitching are unattractive.The treatment did help control static in my hair. I looked up the ingredients on EWG.org and Pubmed and learned that several of the fragrances are considered to be a Possible human immune system toxicant or allergen.  Furthermore there are concerns about preservative Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate which is toxic when inhaled and  Butylphenyl Methlyproprional which may be estrogenic. More research is needed.

This is a great deep conditioning treatment for coarse curly hair. It is a heavy duty conditioner meant for fragile curls.We put this on my daughters head and then put on a plastic cap. We just used a blowdryer to get the conditioner and hair heated. That is necessary for the conditioner to penetrate. The smell was a bit like a perfume but I didn't hate it. After  minutes we rinsed the conditioner out. You need good hot water to rinse it. Her hair was definitely moisturized but I noticed a real difference in the hair at the nape of her neck. That area is dry frizzy brittle and prone to knotting. The deep penetrating treatment definitely made for fewer tangles. Good for thick curly hair,Neutral
I just got this and really like it.  I know that everyone has different hair so this is why I described my hair type.  My hair can be a bit oily at the roots and dry at the ends.  This cream is a medium weight.  It has a pleasant light aroma that will not interfere with your perfume or other scented products.  You leave it on about  minutes and rinse out.  It leaves your hair smoother but not greasy or oily.  I have used Clairol's Condition many years and this is just as good and less expensive and not so thick.  ITS A KEEPER. Nice for coarse thick hair,Neutral
I am very perfume sensitive and I could not even detect the faintest hint of perfume.  Some of the other reviewers said the scent was strong but I swear I couldn't detect any and I'm extremely sensitive to perfumes.  As far as the conditioning goes I think it works alright though it left my hair a bit greasy.  I applied a smallish blob right after shampooing left it in for the rest of the shower and then rinsed it out as thoroughly as I could.  I proceeded to blow dry my hair and I could definitely detect residual oil.  I was going to go to my tennis practice anyway and I wear a ball cap so it didn't matter at the time but if I was going out somewhere important I would have had to re-wash my hair.I guess my hair just didn't need the extra conditioning.  I'm not saying this is a bad product at all because I probably didn't use it exactly in the right way.  I don't have a hair-dryer with a cap that I could sit under for a while to let the conditioner penetrate deeper into my hair.  I would definitely use this product if I had super dry or damaged hair from bleaching and coloring. Motions At Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner,Neutral
This thick white pleasant smelling conditioner moisturized my dry scalp and color-treated hair in TEN minutes after shampooing! It smoothed my frizzies into their natural curls without tangles. THIS helps eliminate breakage for me due to less tugging and pulling while in a rush. It rinses pretty clean but leaves a coating on the hair strands; nothing heavy to weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy. It really made my hair feel and look good. It works well with my other hair products.It worth a try BUT I'm not sure this will replace your best working conditioner already in your hair arsenal. I'll use it as a backup or alternative to my favorite deep conditioner periodically. The NEW fragrance although pleasant bugs me as too fruity/floral and is part of the reason I only gave it  STARS. It smells something like perfumes my Mom or Granny would wear. Moisturizes Hair & Scalp,Neutral
First let me say that this product has some good qualities. The smell is fresh clean and citrusy not perfumed and overpowering. Second it is easy to use and inexpensive. You need very little of the product for a treatment.  On the other side this is not a good product for sensitive skin. Most exfoliants rely on acid peel or grainy texture to remove dead surface cells. Some products I've tried use the grain texture but it is so fine in texture that you don't notice it.  That is not the case with this one. It felt like mild sandpaper moving across my face. I found it uncomfortable to use it for the full one minute.  After the treatment my face was quite red and blotchy for more than a half hour so I would never use it right before leaving the house in the morning.  As far as change in a appearance  my pores were slightly cleaner but the results I got using the Neutrogena clean pore treatment were far superior without the harshness or discomfort.  If you like rough and grainy go for it.  If you have sensitive skin try Neutrogena. Not that effective. Not good for sensitive skin.,sensitive skin
I bought this foundation to use for costume purposes but it goes on so smoothly that I now use it as a base layer under my skin-tone foundation.  My very pale skin has dark grey under eye circles that orange/yellow/green concealers cannot hide properly but this true white seems to work.  My fair foundation over top warms the color back up and there is no trace of grey underneath.This white is a bluish white vs creamy white so it should cancel out most of the yellow or orange tones in virtually every skin color to get a truly goth pale.It mixes perfectly with my Mac Studio Sculpt NC foundation (no separation or clumping) so it works very well to lighten and tone down the orange glow of the fairest shade mac makes.  I love the coverage and wear of my Mac foundation and now the color is perfect too.- star for it being perfumed. It could do without it and it smells a bit girly for my liking. Goes on smoothly,Neutral
I have absolutely gorgeous smelling lavender body wash and shampoo therefore I decided to give Yardley's a try based on the lavender scent.  Unfortunately I did not find Yardley's to embrace that beautiful smell that other lavender products I have represent.  The smell to me is very musky but off.  I'm not one for colognes or perfumes that smell like chemicals and Yardley's is just strange.  I had heard so many good things about it I thought maybe I got a bad bottle or something because I was shocked that I disliked it so much. There seem to be some lighter after-notes (did I smell vanilla?) which are more pleasant but the initial lavender smell is not.  The good thing is that once it's on it doesn't permeate everything so you don't smell horrible all day.  I didn't really care for the bottle either it's pretty bland compared to some of the cool things they do with packaging these days.  I think I'll stick to my body wash (Dial's Lavender and Twilight Jasmine is to die for) and my lavender shampoo.  Too bad the Internet doesn't have smell-o-vision it could have saved me a few bucks. WHO KNEW LAVENDER SMELLED LIKE MUSK AND CHEMICALS,Neutral
It has a perfume scent but it is nice and heavy. Great for detangling b African American hair. I've also noticed less breakage when using this. I took some very old kinky twists down after about . months and all I had was hair shedding not a bunch of strands all over my floor. Before that my hair was breaking like crazy.I've used this alone or as an ingredient in my homemade deep conditioner (combine a tbs of crece pelo with - indian herbal powders (shakaki cassia obogata bhrami etc.) a tablespoon of shea moisture deep conditioner and - oils (e.g. castor jojoba amla etc.) aloe vera juice and distilled water. If this is too much prep work for you just use by itself. Good Creme Conditioner to Help with B/C Hair Breakage,Neutral
This is the best makeup remover anything I've ever used.  Moisturizers as it cleans removes absolutely everything with one cloth no perfumes...just the perfect cleansing wipe ever created by woman! Amazing,Neutral
I almost didn't get this because it's just so dang cheap and I didn't think it would work well. But I found it works just as well as expensive conditioners. The fact that is so cheap means I can use a lot of it any time I want. The one downside: it doesn't have a flowery perfume scent but the smell of cocoa butter is not terrible.If you have dry course hair (no matter what race you are) you may find this to be worthwhile. It's just too strong to use on my roots so I avoid that area. It does take a time commitment if you leave it on for a long time and it does take awhile to fully rinse out. But after regular use my hair is breaking less and less and it just feels smooth. It works,long time
Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry Sensitive Skin Fragrance Free Non-comedogenic was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It's a reasonably priced product.  And he suggested it for the treatment of my hands which were super-dry scaly red cracking and peeling and all that good stuff after several weeks' use of a perfumed soap.  Mind you I know/knew better but the soap was given me by someone of whom I'm fond and I just wanted to use it.  Bad decision.At any rate the doctor recommended I use the moisturizer morning and evening and after every hand washing that I could and I have.  I also use it after the morning shower to buff up feet knees elbows various bits and pieces.  The makers state that is a creamy non-greasy formula free of lanolins parabens and fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin; also that it has been formulated to be non-comedogenic.  They further state that it has been clinically proven to bind water to the skin and prevent moisture loss.I see a lot of steroids in the product's ingredients and that does trouble me.  But I do notice that the formulation is non-greasy enough to be acceptable for workaday use and that my hands are in a better condition than they were.  And I swear I don't care who gives me perfumed soap in the future: I'm not going to use it.  Or only to scent the sock drawer. Non-Greasy Enough for Workaday Use; Hands Look Better,sensitive skin
I've always seen this in Target and was always wondering what it's like. So yesterday I went shopping in Sams Club and found this for $. and I was like 'hey why not give it a try'. So that night I used it in the shower and I fell in love. It has a nice waterfall/outdoor scent which can pass for perfume haha. But anyways the scent isn't overpowering and a little goes a LONG way and it lathers up to my likings. After I got out of the shower my skin instantly felt smooth and refreshed and the lovely scent lingered on. When this runs out (which will be no time soon) I will definitely buy this again! I highly recommend this to women AND men! Relaxing!,long way
This body wash is great.  I have skin that dries out easily so during our Michigan winters I usually splurge on a moisturizing body wash.  This year instead I have been using Neutrogena Body Oil after my shower.  I use the oil right after I turn off the water before I get out of the shower.  I stand for a minute to allow the oil to penetrate.  With this method I do not need the extra moisture in a body wash.  I've fallen in love with Neutrogena products.  I've seen Rainbath at the pharmacy before but I finally bought some a few weeks ago and was instantly hooked.  The scent is quite pleasant.  People complain that it wears off too soon but I prefer a product with a scent that isn't so strong that you are stuck with it all day (that's what perfume is for).  I wish the body oil came in the same scent though.  This body wash does not dry out my skin (surprisingly) and it leaves no residue.  It is now my go-to product for body wash. Great Scent and Not Drying,dry skin
I've used Neutrogena Rainbath before and am thrilled that it is available in such a large size. The smell is so unusual in a good way--fresh and clean without super-heavy perfumes. It also doesn't leave any kind of soap scum and my skin doesn't feel dry after using it. It lathers as one would expect and a little goes a long way. So Fresh and So Clean,long way
I've tried many bath products in my life.  No matter what Rainbath will always be my favorite little luxury.  I suffer from both allergies and extremely sensitive skin that tends to be a bit dry.  Rainbath contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (unfortunately) so it isn't organic  but otherwise it is kind to my skin and doesn't give me a migraine with heavy perfumes.I would describe Rainbath as a unisex product.  Some women complain that it is too masculine but I'm the type of girl who loves oriental and woodsy scents.  Rainbath is golden-brown in color with the light consistency of gel.  It has the most gorgeous herbal scent.  It makes me think about being in the Maine woods with the scent of trees and rain.  It is just very natural and earthy.  I feel like a sexy hippie when I shower...meow!Rainbath is simply lovely.  It can also double as a facial cleanser too. A Classic Bath Staple,sensitive skin
I fell in love with this scent immediately.It's not overpowering but subtle and sweet.With a perfect mixture of scents some being pomegranate lily fig and musk this perfume  just smells lavish and great for day or evening.Very romantic scent! Sweet and Light,Neutral
Haiku smells too good to be an Avon perfume. I really love wearing it. No matter what time of the day it's always appropriate.To clarify - I don't like strong perfumes that &#;make a statement.&#; My ideal perfume smells clean and soapy maybe a little floral. Haiku is pretty close to that ideal. It's interesting and semi-complex but not overwhelming. Of course I don't douse myself with it either nor would I ever ever wear ANY perfume to the gym.Haiku is lovely and personal; I wear it for myself and hope sincerely that no one else ever smells it on me. If someone else smells your perfume it's TOO strong! Be considerate of those who suffer from migraines asthma and allergies please! Haiku is a modern classi,Neutral
This has become my new signature scent. I absolutely love it! It smells so nice and light yet it lasts all day.  I get compliments on it all the time and people are always shocked that it's an Avon product. I've started lying about what perfume I'm wearing because I don't want everyone I know copying me lol.Note: I did not purchase from this seller. Love it!,Neutral
Love this perfume. Reminds me of Anais Anais but just slightly different perhaps a touch more green. Beautiful white floral fragrance very fresh & vibrant for Spring very feminine. Fresh white floral,Neutral
This summer my mother placed some jasmine flowers in our sun room. She had several kinds but one of them (which was the smallest plant) had a particularly strong scent with the few flowers it had. It smelled so good and I guess that summer memory led me to find a jasmine-scented perfume. I love the smell of this perfume because it is sophisticated and elegant and yet it is fresh and not overpowering. I love the mid notes and base notes! The bottle is also very beautiful. It reminds me of the historical Japanese houses. This is definitely not a girly perfume as it does not have a sweet sugary smell to it. I recommend this to anyone who has a mature type of personality who embodies grace and elegance. Sophisticated and elegant,Neutral
I've been using this stuff for around  or  weeks now.  I haven't seen any visible improvements in the dark circles under my eyes.  I don't really have crows feet or bags under my eyes (with or without cream) so I can't say how it would work with firming the skin.  As far as minimizing the appearance of fine lines - it accomplishes that as well as any moisturizer I have tried.That being said it is a wonderful light weight cream.  It has a delicate scent that isn't overwhelming.  It doesn't contain any perfumes but I think it smells a bit like milk chocolate.  I also like the fact that it is a natural product and I'm not risking my health when using it. Although I haven't seen too many results yet it's still a great moisturizer,Neutral
This is great stuff but I cannot stand to use it it makes me sick to my stomach and gives me a headache.  I am still wishing someone could identify the ingredient used in so many products that smells like Raid to me.  It is absolutely foul.I am completely out of options now there is not a single hair product that works the way I want without a perfume or bug spray smell both of which make me physically ill. Does anyone make a similar product without a scent?,Neutral
This body wash smells very light very pleasant and not overpowering. Once out of the shower the smell lingers just a little bit longer there are no heavy perfumes or dyes. It leathers ok as it is natural there is not much foam. Overall. I will definitely buy it again! Great body wash,Neutral
I have used this cleanser on and off again for the past few years. Even though the label has changed quite a bit over the years I can honestly say the quality of the product has not.It leaves my face feeling clean AND moisturized. This is one of the few face cleansers I have used that I don't feel the need to apply face moisturizer right after. Its nice and light and does not have much of a smell which is great (that's what perfumes and body splashes are for right?)I recommend this product and last year I put one of these bottles in a gift basket I made one of my best friends for her birthday. She enjoyed it as well ;) I've used this again and again,Neutral
For me this product is a must-have.  Usually order it directly from Philosphy but found the quick delivery and economical price on Amazon too good to pass up.  Some prefer the purity cleanser and I sometimes use it but for aging skin I like a good exfoliator.  This is it.  It is mild but effective.  Matter of fact I use this with my Clarisonic and have no irritation.  For me this  ounce bottle should last a year if used twice daily.  There is not perfume smell nor chemical smell to this product--just clean smelling.  Your face will love it! Use this every single day!,Neutral
My dermatitis acted up again earlier this month and while I've used Cetaphil and Aquaphor and Dr. Bronner's I was so insane with itch that a friend recommended I find an olive oil soap (without coconut oils as I've been using natural hair products with a lot of coconut oil and derivatives and it was possible I'd developed a sensitivity). In searching I happened upon this brand and decided to order and try it.It's really gentle and leaves my skin soft smooth and non-itchy (the last being hugely important to me). It does have a strongish olive oil scent but not a perfumey one. Makes sense it smells like OO no? Some find this offputting but it doesn't linger. You smell it while showering but not after. I'd also add that this lathers discreetly but adequately and nicely. It's not sudsfest but enough to know you are getting some surfactant action going and getting off the dirt and grime (if you're grimy hah).My rash is gone and I'm now ordering more of this. I don't use it on my face which is the most sensitive part of my body. I still use the Cetaphil on that (and the Kinerase Gentle Cleanser when I have makeup to take off). But for the neck down this has been great.It does have a slippery feel but not slimy as another commenter posted. At least in my opinion.  I had ordered my original bars from iHerb on sale but this is a competitive price for the -pack so I'm ordering this one. Hope they don't mess up and send me the scented. I can't use that one.Update: Well I found a saponified OO soap bar I like as well if not better. It's a Greek OO one and it REALLY is unfragranced (ie Olivella has a stronge OO smell to it very vegetal one might say). It's called ApteraOlive Oil Soap - . ozand I give it a slightly higher thumbs up than Olivella for being really fragrance free and even LESS sudsing action--which prolly means gentler. Ordered a dozen this AM from Mother Nature which also sells it through amazon for those who hate the OO smell of Olivella and those who want a slightly less slimy/slippery sensation. Olivella is more oil feeling than Aptera.  I will probably use both as I like both and think for the allergy-prone rotating products is a good idea anyway. Two great products that are good for your sensitive skin. Yay.Enjoy and have happy skin! My crazy sensitive skin likes this a lot and it cleans wonderfully,sensitive skin
I really like the 'sea' line of Alba products but this night cream is a quite a bit heavier than what I normally use - Neutrogena's Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night.  I will try it for a while for the 'even' effect to see how it works.The other 'sea' products have a mild 'beachy' smell that's much more subtle.  This cream is over-scented in my opinion.  It's not offensive but it's like putting perfume/cologne on your face before bed - not really what I want in a night cream.I'll see how the other benefits pan out and report back. Fairly heavy night cream,Neutral
It was ok but a bit too scented for me for something I would use on my face. It seemed somewhat perfumed didn't feel like a very good facial cleanser for me for what I was looking for it was ok,Neutral
VERY strong orange smell.  I don't know about anyone else but I prefer NOT to smell like an orange.  I always buy unscented items so they don't clash with my perfume.  May be a great cream but....  I am hoping the smell fades....and fast!  Makes me wonder if I'll attract flies when/if I go out with this cream on.It says it can be used under makeup.  Don't think I'd wear this cream out of doors.Update:  The smell DOES fade after about  minutes though my dog can still smell it.  Not sure if I just got used to it or if it faded completely.It would be nice if they could somehow remove the smell.Update:  The cream does seem to do a good job of moisturizing. Smells STRONGLY,Neutral
I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. I have a thing for jasmine and she has a thing for the scent free. Which to me has a medical scent. She and I have found a happy medium. This is mellow enough where she does not consider it perfumed. To me it is just strong enough to know it is there when we are close. Perfect. It is very silky and light and though I do not use it on myself she reports it works just as well as any other moisturizers she has used. Happiness Very nice,Neutral
I can't tell you how happy I am that I found this product!!  I live in Idaho a very dry climate and need major moisturizing.  I used to buy products from L'Occitane but have noticed their new formulations don't work as well as some of their older products (alcohol glycerin and water are the first three ingredients!) and I was willing to pay any price.  The product is all natural (LOVE this!) and extremely moisturizing without getting hard (ever bought cocoa butter that was solid in the jar?).  When I wear it on my legs it gives that glowy look that makes your skin look fantastic.  When you add the cost factor into this product I'm over the moon.  Never again am I spending $ on jars of cream!The scent is interesting slightly nutty coffee coconut?  Smells like a bottle of suntan lotion with a twist.  It's not my favorite smell but it's ok.  The smell seems to fade after awhile.  I can layer my perfume on top (Prada Infusion D'Orangeur) and well it smells like I just came in from Hawaii.  Not too bad! I finally found an amazing healthy inexpensive cream that works!!,Neutral
I've been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years and really like every product of theirs I've tried.  I've been using theirAlba Botanica Kukui Nut Organic Body Oil .-Ouncefor a few years and love the scent but the oil can be a bit greasy for  me so I picked up this body cream since it seemed like it has the same scent -- and it does!This body cream is what I would say is mid-weight in terms of how thick or thin body butters can be but it sinks right in and leaves your skin silky soft.  It has a delicious brown sugar scent that remains subtle so it doesn't clash too much if you wear perfume or cologne.I also use it on my legs right after shaving and it doesn't sting or burn.Overall a fantastic product! Smells like brown sugar and leaves your skin silky soft!,Neutral
I use the entire collection of Avalon's Vitamin C stuff and this is one of the products I will not go without. It is great to use after cleansing and leaves my skin feeling fresh. It has a great orange/citrus scent that is not at all perfumey or fake. It is also a great deal compared to what I have paid in the past for toners that are not nearly as good at removing the last layer of dirt and brightening up my complexion. To boot I have dry skin and  this stuff has never ever left my skin feeling taught or tight. Perfect stuff! Love this whole line and will use it forever,dry skin
I have uncomfortably dry hands in the winter and peeling rough skin around my fingernails that snags on fabrics.  I bought some cotton gloves to put on over hand cream to wear all night.notes- O'Keeffe's is winning for best results overnight use over Aveeno Curel and Cetaphil cream- it has no added scent but it's not odorless. I don't care for the smell - it's a bit nutty plus something else I don't like- that said I'm putting gloves on immediately and going to bed so I only notice the scent when applying- its texture is very similar to coconut oil hard oily and a bit waxy. other reviewers say it absorbs quickly but I don't think I want to wear it during the day- the effects last for a long time after taking off the gloves and washing my hands multiple times. Hands are comfortable and very few skin snag bits- my husband uses it for his knuckles (men don't use hand lotion) and he's happy with the not perfume-y odor and the results- I am very happy with the results and will continue to use it with gloves for overnight. I don't need to constantly apply lotion during the day and when I do I use one of my other &#;women's&#; lotions- I'd take one star off for the odor but that's unfair because it's doing what I hoped it would good for overnight,long time
I purchased this awesome product for my hands and of course what a bang up job it does just like everybody says.  It's cheap and you only need to use a teensy bit.  It does feel different like you've got a light barrier on your skin.  And I LOVE that there's no perfumey fragrance.  So I've been trying many different anti-wrinkle treatments lately for my face and yes they do help some.  I'm pushing  and I do have very very good skin.  But with all staying out of the sun my whole life and moisturizing like no tomorrow no product was making a noticeable difference on the asscrack between my eyebrows.  Really bad frown lines too.  Being in the health field I'm STRONGLY AGAINST Botox but I was really considering it because my Crypt Keeper forehead didn't match the rest of my face.  But I also hate the way a Botox forehead looks like a stretched shiny balloon.  A couple nights ago I put some of the O'Keeffe's on my stubborn forehead.  What the heck right?  Why not?  I thought if it does such a good job on the much tougher skin on the hands maybe it will do something good for my face.  After I let it sink in a bit I put my DermaGen anti-wrinkle patch over it and went to sleep.  (If you haven't discovered those patches yet check them out. They really help.) Made an % difference in two days.  By the way I've never written a review here before but I just had to share this.  And in the morning I DON'T wash my face (because I've finally now got it all dewy and supple just like I like) just put on a tad more moisturizer yes the smallest bit of O'Keeffe's on my problem forehead.  Then my sunscreen love the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer liquid daily sunblock.  My face looks so much better all day.  I do my face washing at night now before I do the moisturizing.  You should know my skin is uber-dry and super-fair. And if your skin is dry to normal like mine for goodness sakes' throw away your toner.  Toner is for people with oily skin.  You don't need it and it just makes more wrinkles (so you have to spend more $ on trying to fix them).  Anyhow I love that this simple (and cheap) product is doing what my $ skin regiment couldn't.  I look better now than in pictures from  years ago.  Needless to say every one of my friends is getting this for Christmas.  Hope it does for you what it did for me.  I've only been using on my face for a few days and the difference is truly staggering.  Oh and on the lighter fine lines they are GONE.  That's what I said GONE. Need I say more?  I am going to be a life long O-Keeffe's user.  THE BEST ANTI-WRINKLE PRODUCT I'VE EVER USED. Holy Cow!  Try it on your deep face wrinkles!!!!  Pure Magic!!!,Neutral
A decent body wash -- but nothing special.The packaging is adequate -- a nice big bottle with an easy flip-top lid.The scent is refreshing generally man-like a bit perfume-y (similar to old fashioned green Vitabath but with an added minty-ness) -- but the scent does not linger on my skin.It is a clear blue gel without obvious moisturizing components.  It seems to neither dry nor moisturize my skin.  There is a distinct but mild minty cool sensation on my skin as I wash with it.I would purchase this again at a good price but I would not seek it out over other gels.Just a brief addition -- I recently saw a commercial for this product and  they basically said exactly what I did!  Smells ok gets you clean and doesn't dry out your skin -- but don't expect a miracle. Just better than average,dry skin
This is a rose perfume oil. It is too strong smelling for me I add a few drops of this to my baby oil. I will have to try the other Auric oils. My order come before the estimated date so I will naturally purchase other oils/incense from this seller again. A rose is a rose.,Neutral
I LOVE the smell of roses and I LOVE the smell of this rose perfume oil.  It is very strong so a little bit goes a long way but the good news is this oil lasts for hours and hours.  It's goes on strong but the dry down is very very nice almost tea like if that makes any sense.  This is definitely the best rose fragrance I have ever come across.  The price was awesome shipping was super fast and I will definitely order again and again!!! ROSE to the occasion!!!!,little bit
This is an awesome rose scented oil perfume. If you don't like a strong rose smell this is not for you. If the smell of roses is what you crave. This is perfect! Rosey,Neutral
This cream is a light creamy color and has the same strong perfume-y scent that all the products in the Benefiance line have. The more I use the Benefiance products the more I have grown to dislike this scent. It's a rather dated scent and smells more like something that my mom's generation would have liked.I'm in my s so I do have some wrinkles in my eye area but not too many. Nonetheless I still rely on a good eye cream to make it through the day. I don't want anything too heavy or greasy for daytime use but for nighttime I do look for something a bit heavier. As it turns out Benefiance Anti-Wrinkle Cream is more suitable for nighttime or at least in my situation.When I get some of the cream on my fingertips it has a lightweight feel to it - not too thick or heavy. But when I tap in my eye area that all changes. The cream starts to feel a bit sticky and actually looks a bit greasy. It doesn't absorb very well and sits on top of skin. Perhaps the goal of Shiseido is to give skin a dewy appearance hence detracting from the wrinkles. However there's no way I can apply makeup on top of it since it leaves my skin feeling oily.I'm using up this jarBenefiance Anti-Wrinkle Cream at night (I got a jar as a part of a gift pack.) It's still a bit heavy for my liking but it does seem to lock in moisture and leave my eye area looking refreshed and  moisturized in the morning. But would I buy it on my own? No not at all. The scent and the greasiness of it are not appealing and I'm not convinced that it has improved the overall appearance of the skin in my eye area in the month I have been using it. Too heavy and greasy for me,Neutral
After reading so many great reviews and a few bad ones I wanted to give this cream a try and see how it worked for me.  Its a very rich thick cream that feels like it really moisturizes without leaving residue nor an oily feeling. IT does have a strong perfume smell which is not bad nor too overpowering.  My only complaint was that after a day of wearing it i broke out.I am hispanic dark hair light skin and in my s.  My skin is a bit sensitive and I have had acne.  Now and for the past  years or so I get a random pimple here and there but nothing major.  I do break out when I try new products that aggravate my skin but that is more like a rash than acne. I think this is what happened when I tried this product.After wearking it about - hours my face broke out into a dozen or so red bumps and another dozen or so mini pimples. Not regular pimples just tiny tiny whiteheads? When this has happened to me in the past I just wipe with astringent and it calms down the next day.  Well I forgot i was trying a new product and reapplied it after and it just got worse instead of better.My friend used it and her skin was fine but she has never had any skin problems. I think that maybe this product is not for those with sensitive skin or are/have been prone to break outs.  I am sure that those that aren't may benefit.  I know my friend benefitted when I told her she could keep it.  She loved the perfume smell. :) Probably not good for sensitive skin...,sensitive skin
I saw the ad from Olay claiming that this cream was as good as $ creams so I went and purchased one. But the scent is truly way too strong. It smells like I'm putting on perfume! I use Shiseido Future Solution LX Night Cream ($) and this cream does not even come close to what it claims (as good as $ creams) it can't even match Shiseido's which is / as expensive. Truly a let down especially with the really strong scent for a cream. If this was a lotion I would expect the scent to be strong but for a facial cream the scent is overpowering and feels like it belongs on the body not on the face. It makes the cream feel very cheap and substandard. Really strong perfume / scent,Neutral
I thought I was getting a different product. I didn't like the smell very strong and I gave me a headache. Smells like cheap perfume,Neutral
I have just finished my first bottle of this product and am about to begin my second tube and have noticed very good results already. The price is reasonable and depending on how much you use it you can get at least a month out of the bottle. I would recommend trying it as a single purchase first then moving to subscribe and save ordering to save money if you are going to keep using it on a regular basis. This adds up to a pretty decent amount of savings versus buying it in the store.My purchase of this product was prompted by a desire to help reduce or remove fading tan lines from a sunburn. I also had a few areas that were rough and lightly discolored that I wanted to smooth out. However I have very sensitive skin that makes it difficult to find suitable products for. I began using it just once every other day for a week to test for irritation. When none occurred I moved to once daily for a week then twice daily every day after that. I do not use other exfoliating products on the areas I use the mini-peel on and I use a very light moisturizer only at night. As a result I have not experienced a lot of dryness or peeling.The first few days of use I did not notice a change but at the end of the week I noticed that my arms and hands were smoother. After the next week the tan areas had begun to fade and the mild keratosis pilaris on my arms had also begun to lessen. Over the course of a month I noticed that my arms and hands looked and felt much smoother and youthful. I have seen far fewer breakouts from the KP than with any other product I have tried which was a big surprise. The product does not feel as warm as claimed but it still does its job as advertised. The fragrance is very mild and does not linger on the skin for very long after it has been washed off which is important for anyone sensitive to the smell of perfumes in their products.A few things to note: this product does have AHA in it and it is very important to either cover the treated areas with clothing or wear a heavier sunblock than normal for at least a week after use. If you use this product every day always keep the affected areas well covered. If you do not you are at a higher risk of sunburn which is important to keep in mind if you have very pale or sensitive skin. Great Product For Even Sensitive Skin,great product
I LOVE the Revitalizing Leave-In by Jane Carter not only because of it's incredible scent (couldn't stop smelling the bottle when I first bought it) but because it gives a light moisture that's great on relaxed hair like mine and really helps detangle it as you blow-dry. The aroma isn't strong but they should make a perfume out of this stuff that's how good it smells! However if you don't like floral scents stay away. LOVE IT!,Neutral
Now this is a perfume that I love to have sitting up on my dresser. Very pretty lid! The scent of this perfume is also very wonderful. I'm not a big fan of floral scents but when I smelled this I was taken away by how beautiful and feminine it smells. Whereas a lot of floral fragrances could be overpoweringly strong this one is very delicate and light enough to wear daily. I recommend purchasing the . oz bottle of this as you'll become obsessed with this beautiful fragrance! Very nice smell cute bottle.,Neutral
This is an awesome perfume for any time but especially it the spring.  It's light and fresh and not to heavy this and Marc Jacobs &#;Oh Lola&#; are two of my favorites. Favorite fragrence for spring,Neutral
The bottle is so cute!  I got this as a birthday gift for my sister she has been fawning over this perfume every time we go into a Sepnora. I know she'll love it! I am horrible at describing scents but this is the perfect summer scent. Light and a little floral The bottle is so cute!,Neutral
I love this perfume. It's such a clean fresh fragrance that is floral without being too stuffy or overwhelming. The daisy scent is unique and fun and this is the perfect perfume for spring. I do wish it had better staying power but oh well. Gorgeous fragrance,Neutral
i bought this perfume because i saw all the good reviews that every boudy gave this perfume but i didnt like it i gave this as achristmas present and was expecting that this perfume would smell really good but i didnt like it i do not recomend it uher perfume,Neutral
i bought this perfume after reading the reviews.but wit most reviewers saying that it didnt last longi actually find dat opposite.its soo strong but still ok i guess. too strong,Neutral
The only perfume I wear. It's getting harder to find but I love the scent of this. Very light very clean. It's not overpowering and will not give me a headache like some of those muskier scents. Love this!,Neutral
Not for me! Not for me at all! On me it smelled like hairspray weird alcohol-like notes and all. This was a perfume I had to wash off. Nope nope nope. It makes me kind of sad because the bottle is pretty. Smells like hairspray,Neutral
this is a really unique perfume  like none i have smell  really nice and i don't even like flowery perfume  but i must say this is nice giving it  star because i missed the mail man and i had a bit a problem getting it  they don't rediliver u have to pick it up went to the post office left me wallet so no id to collect it had to go back the other day  wish they use ups or fedex but other than that im pleased plus i order just the perfume and got a gift set in stead which i don't mind at all and other samples and coupons from fragrance net  im enjoying this,Neutral
For the price I should have known that this perfume sold by Amazon was an imitation to the real deal. I have bought cologne from Amazon in the past so I decided to try perfumes for myself . I feel so bad about this because I made my friend go through the hassle to buy me this and got disappointed. Smh...Absolute failure! Smells like more like rubbing alcohol in some remnants of the real thing. Smh..... I was deceived!!!!! Not real!!!,Neutral
I love this scent but it has been become difficult to find in the usual places for anywhere near what Amazon sells it for. I have received many compliments when I wear this. Amazon has the best price for this perfume as far as I have found so far. Wonderful smell,Neutral
There's nothing especially blue or Mediterranean about EA Mediterranean imo. It's good but not great on me.In the opening it has that magnolia note that is a bit plastic-like to me. After a short drydown Mediterranean wears like a woody musk skin scent on me. It's one of the few perfumes my DH actually has said anything about. After a nuzzle he said You smell good. Translation from male-speak: This is one of the best things you wear. Wear it again.I really enjoy it dry and I would wear it more often ... if it wasn't for that plastic magnolia! Neither Blue nor Mediterrnean,Neutral
Daisy is a very nice fragrance.  I usually can't wear American perfumes because the synthetic oils change scent on me.  These do too but the scent is still nice.  Now I have two scents to wear. A very nice fragrance,Neutral
I bought this for my best friend. Sephora and Ulta sell a . ounce of this same perfume for about  dollars. amazon.com had a great price on this and she loves it. She said she gets compliments all the time and really loves this perfume! Thanks amazon for making this an affordable gift! Another Gift :),Neutral
I love this scent.  I am not a perfume fanatic so I can't really describe the scent. But it lasts all day long and men always tell me I smell good. Mmmmm Mmmmm Good,Neutral
I absolutely love it. The only thing I will change next time is the size. It is very difficult to hold it is so big. I will pay a little extra for the smaller bottle to be able to hold it more comfortably And I don't mean pay extra I mean not get a better deal by buying the big bottle for a better price.And it is the real perfume. I was worried it would not be being from a discount place. But it is. The real deal,Neutral
This perfume isn't exactly what I was expecting.It has more of a grassy smell than floral so it's not too feminine and that part I like.However the scent only lasts a few hours.My husband said he likes it but I was disapointed.While the scent is ok I prefer sunflowers for a not too sweet floral scent. Just ok to me,Neutral
I tried this perfume at Sephora but didn't want to pay the full price for the . oz. AMAZING!!!!! Smells divine. Stays on the hole day. I could even smell it on clothes the day after I've worn them. Flowery subtle light fresh (not fresh in a citrusy way). I keep it for special occasions but can definitely be worn either day or night. Quite distinctive fragrance. I feel like anyone would love this. Everybody I know does. My Favourite,Neutral
Tuccini seller is good but the perfume is not.  Its a very cheap scent as expected. Oneof those where if it werent made so cheaply would have nice notes to it but the overwhelming chepness to it makes you sick to your stomach.  One of those where you pass someone in public wearing it and think they are wearing some chemical rather than perfume. cheap scent,Neutral
This perfume is so much lovelier than the price (or the name) might indicate. It's a luscious gardenia/tuberose type fragrance just so sweet and nice. It lasts a long time and it also has excellent sillage. I love it! Wonderful floral scent!,long time
I sampled this at a department store and knew I had to have it. Scents of apple & peach then flowers mellowing into a creamy base. I reminded me of a grown-up version ofExclamation By Coty For Women. Cologne Spray . OZ. I LOVED IT! Eventually I tracked it down here ....Amazon shipped an open box item ... no seal protection or manufacturer wrapping. Then I try a whiff of the juice only to find that it was all chemicals. No fruit no flowers just chemicals. After about  hours there was a slight hint of creamy vanilla chemicals.I don't know what happened but here are some theories ... Amazon shipped a bad unsealed (returned?) product that was tampered with or had turned bad in heat/sun ... Amazon purchased a lot of perfume returns and is selling them as first quality sealed products ... I don't know diddly squat about fragrances. You decide.To Amazon's credit they allowed me to return the item (which is NOT consistent with their return policy on fragrances) & they paid for shipping. I have no idea whether or not they will destroy the product or return it to inventory so be aware that this bottle of juice may be yours next. DISAPPOINTED!!,Neutral
I had to laugh when I saw this perfume at my big-lots. So I was surprised when I smelled it and liked it. I got this product at big-lots for $. a day after christmas(. ounzes). I am very picky with perfume and I am so happy I found this one. I usually dont go for the musky perfume but this one has great mixed senses. Just wanted to leave a review so other people wont hesitate to try this like I did at first. Smells Wonderful!,Neutral
I bought this without ever having smelled it and was very pleased at what I got!This is a gorgeous smell. I cannot wear musks (I smell like an old person) but I wear a lot of citrus smells and lemon does really well on me.So I was surprised that this perfume has incense and spice tones in the dry down on me and wasn't overwhelming. And obviously there is the lovely apple as well.I wear it for work (I teach) but it could easily be a nice nighttime perfume as well. The scent is also very long lasting which is a huge benefit.Personally I like the Nina L'Elixir more but it is much brighter and more of a daytime perfume. Incense and Apples,Neutral
My wife has been an ardent fan of this perfume for a couple of years now ever since I picked one up at the Heathrow duty free.This is a very pleasant and subtle fragrance in a stylish bottle. I particularly love this for the major points that I get every time I gift her one of these :) Fruity elegant and sophisticated,Neutral
This is a perfume my girlfriend had been wanting for quite some time and after I got it for her I understood why it is awesome! Perfect gift!,Neutral
I love the scent of this perfume soft floral notes with almost a hint of citrus.  this is my go to scent for date night. one of my favorite perfumes,Neutral
I fell in love with this when I first tried it several years ago and it remains my absolute favorite.  Such a lovely mixture of sweet fruit floral light woods...it's just so very lovely.  Great for everyday wear all seasons. My absolute favorite perfume,favorite perfume
and the bottle itself is worth getting the scent.the scent itself is a little too fruity and too sweet.however if that is your thing you're gonna love it.good thing about it is that it doesn't wear off in seconds like some other seem to (for instance it held twice as long as calvin klein's euphoria).hard to review a fragrance you have to try it on.most important to know it is very sweet and apply/fruity it holds alright and it smells different on different people so make sure you try it on your own skin. best thing about this perfume is the bottle,Neutral
This perfume comes in the cutest bottle- a lovely little red apple. I'm not so fond of the scent however. The apple note is very pleasant but there are weird sharp overtones that seem to overpower everything especially the apple. If the apple note was stronger and the sharp notes weaker I'd like this a whole lot better. Love the bottle,Neutral
I think this is Paris Hilton's best fragrance.  It was her original and by far the sexiest one.  The gift set is great it has everything you need at a great price.  The lotion makes you skin smooth and soft while smelling amazing.  The perfume is just fun and sexy.  It stays on all day long and it is absolutely something you can wear at work out for the night or doing just about anything.  I know some people have speculations because they don't like Paris (I happen to have loved her since day one!) but this scent is too sexy and feminine to pass up.  I think it is really great for all age groups as well.  My best friend's mom used to wear it and so do younger girls in high school.  It's really one of my all time favorite scents. Love Paris,Neutral

Nice set.  I love this perfume.  I have bought it for few years now.  The body cream and shower gel are regular size.  I like the small size perfume for my purse.  Happy with purchase! Nice Set,Neutral
Bought it for my wife on her birthday and she couldn't be happier with her gift! The perfume is not overwhelmingly strong like you have to be standing close to the person to smell it but it is subtle and a very attractive scent. It stays on for more than  hours as well. In fact you don't even notice the perfume but it makes the wearer seem more attractive- my wife says the perfume made more guys ask her out in her single days...so all you single ladies out there...you know what to do!! Sexy and mysterious!,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfumes.  It is real!  I would definitely buy it again and recommend it . Love it!,Neutral
This is definitely my favorite fragrance although I noticed that it is no longer that easy to find in stores. This is one of the most lasting perfumes from Givenchy. I could spray it in the  morning and still smell it when I got back home at night. Also the smell on the clothes is even more persistent. It is a very pleasant fragrance not too heavy a little floral. I think it is the perfect day to day perfume. Favorite fragrance!,Neutral
I am noticing several men saying they have been complimented on their smell while wearing this... There is a reason for that... It smells like a female perfume! I got a sample that didn't say for men and it smelt amazing. And several other family members smelt it and all said I should get myself a bottle... I go into the store to get it and they said it's a perfume for men... I was in shock. It isn't a manly perfume. It sweet and nice. I only gave  stars because this should be made for men and women. Because clearly women are drawn to it! Women Love It,Neutral
Pros:  Leaves my hair clean feeling and shiny.  Tames my frizz.  and no wierd perfume smell.Cons: The effect is cumulative and after the rd use I found my hair was lank and felt heavy from product.  the shine doesnt really last more than a couple of days.This doesnt work as nicely as I thought it would.  But it does help with the frizzies.  So maybe only use it once every  weeks... works on frizzy hair,Neutral
I'm impressed with this product. I am  with brown and some grey hair medium-length. I wanted something to make my hair shiny. This product's effects were noticeable after the first use. Very soft I'm very happy with the results. I have only done the -min leave-in wet treatment - you can also do a  min dry hair (once a week option). The product does have a perfumey smell - but I like it and I'm fairly sensitive to strong odors. I would recommend this product. Works great,Neutral
I have  year old color treated hair. I started coloring my hair to give it some volume because as I got older my hair was getting thinner (I'm ). I am growing out my natural color and have about  now. I noticed it will not add waves to color treated hair so keep that in mind. And it works much better on my natural hair vs the dyed hair. It makes my natural hair feel thicker at the top. I st blow dryed my hair until it was almost dry then sprayed some product in my hand and disbursed it with my fingers and then finished blow drying. The result was just ok (not impressed but not unhapppy with the look of my hair). The nd time using I sprayed it directly on my wet towel dried hair (about  pumps) and dug out my defuser & blow dried it until dry. I really liked the way my hair felt & looked. Not as thick as I was hoping but it did add volume. The rd time I blew dried my hair with the defuser until noticebly damp and sprayed a few pumps directly on my hair (-) and then continued to dry all the way with the defuser. This was my least favorite result. So I will continue to grow my hair out & hopefully I will get better results with my natural hair. I have  other inexpensive favorite products I want to mention (I have tried hundreds with many disappointments) that creates volume with thin color treated straight fine hair. One is Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine. It adds a little volume just by shampooing your hair. The other is schwarzkopf gotb powder'ful styling powder. This stuff is amazing. Put a little in your palm dab your fingers and then push them up through your hair. Stay close to the scalp to maximize volume at the roots. Obviously I'm ALWAYS looking for miracle products for my fine straight limp hair and although many disappoint every once & a while you get a good one. Oh forgot to try and describe the smell of this spray. It's not horrible but at first it's not very pleasant until it fades. I would say it smells like cheap shampoo or strong perfumed lotion. The ingredient on the bottle for the scent reads: Fragrance (parfum). My opinion is that it needs to be added to cover up some of the sea ingredients. Lets face it kelp sea salt & algea can be pretty narley smelling. Hope this was helpful! Nice New Look,Neutral
I bought this because it is a gift even though the package was lost and it did not arrive on time in good condition I rate with maximum punctuation that is original and I got very good price which is not like me not arrive on time and is was unrelago: (.... they are very nice guys reciendo for us women;) excellent perfume,Neutral
First ingredient is water (not conditioning) second is alcohol (drying) next up are more alcohol and chemicals you cannot even pronounce with preservatives and perfume. Exactly how is this good for your hair in the long run?  gross what are we doing to ourselves? artificial junk,Neutral
This perfume (Touch) is my favorite perfume. I always get tons of compliments saying You smell so good You smell so sexy. This perfume is not expensive but I'm sure it can be sold as such because it has such a unique fragrance. I love this perfume. The bottle is huge for the price and it was packaged very well and very secure. I'll definitely be ordering this again very soon. Love love love this perfume. If you are thinking about getting this; don't think twice; you won't regret it. I hate stinky perfumes that smell like moth balls and old ladies soooooo I would never give a positive review if it stinks. By the way; I'm still in my 's so I know quality perfume and good smelling perfume. Lol..... One of the best lady fragrances,favorite perfume
I don't use this as lotion. Instead I use it as I would cream perfume. I dab it on my neck and wrists and the scent last a long time. If I need to freshen up I just dab some more on throughout the day. Perfect Perfume,long time
Very nice scent so calming and warm! I absolutely love amber so that's why this def. caught my eye! Great lotion especially when paired with this perfume. Very nice!,Neutral
We've been using Neutrogena sunblocks in the summer for several years now and given that most of our summers are spent in the sun by the pool or at the beach I think I have some authority to state that I am happy with this product.The SPF  spray features:- UVA/UVB protection- Helioplex for keeping the product effective longer- a very fine dry mist- low odor- seems to stay effective for several hours- I don't need to re-apply it after swimmingI disagree with the maker's claim that it 'resists running into eyes'. My personal experience is that you should not apply this anywhere near your eyes unless you have easy access to an abundant water supply to wash it off. Use some dry stick for the areas near your eyes or for your entire face if possible.Besides that this is definitely our favorite sunblock. We buy a dozen or so spray cans of various SPF levels (we use SPF  in Florida) and a few sticks and out family of  is good for the season. We haven't experienced any sunburns lately.Since this is THE sunblock we use and we don't use anything else I am compelled to award this product the  stars it clearly deserves.__________________________________________True story. I know it's true because it happened to me a few days ago.One lazy Saturday afternoon having completed my  or so laps I am in the back of the house reading a book and sipping some drink Scotch and soda. A bunch of kids are splashing in the pool dogs running around over-excited - they are not allowed in the pool area. And I notice T. circling around making herself look busy a hesitant uncomfortable look on her face. She's my wife's girlfriend a neighbor and she's married too  little girls. Her  yr. old one of our  yr. old's best friends. I keep reading enjoying the day sipping my Scotch.To make it short she seems to find the needed energy to address me directly.A. she says what are you wearing?Svimvear I says (a joke she's from Russia).No no no she says what perfume are you wearing? Or is it your aftershave?T. what are you talking about? No perfume says I. I just came out of the pool.But A. you smell soooo good says she. My husband never smells like this. Why can't my husband smell like you do?Ahhhh... I finally realize it's GOT to be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Sunblock Spf   Oz. I'm wearing.True story. It's our favorite sunblock,Neutral
I live in extra-sunny Florida and this is by far the BEST sunblock I've used. It doesn't have a greasy feel or leave me looking like I've been dipped in a vat of oil which most do. It doesn't cause my face to break out. It doesn't have an overly perfume-y smell and most importantly it WORKS! I've used this stuff and stupidly forgotten to reapply for hours and still no sunburn (I'm extremely prone to burning). This is my go-to for everyday use and for water parks. Even after several hours in and out of wave pools water slides and walking around out in the bright sun we've never burnt using this. Even works great for extra fair skin and redheads! THE BEST I have used,Neutral
This is a horrible horrible moisturizer. I was looking for a light day-time moisturizer and this did not fit the bill. It does not moisturize at all it actually does the opposite of moisturize dry out your face. My face was tight itchy overly-perfumed and flaky after each use. I could only use it for a week then I threw it away. A waste of money and I hate wasting my money. I read the reviews and was swayed by the overly positive ones. Never again. I'm asking for samplers from now on. (I'm now using Emerita Day-time Moisturizer and it's fabulous wonderful) Awful Drying and full of Perfume,Neutral
I love this stuff. I had been having problems with my monthly cycles and my doctor put me on Provera. It gave me heart palpitations so I stopped taking it. I found I could just use progesterone cream and get the same effect without the heart scares. It also helps me with my recurrent panic attacks due to low progesterone. The pump makes it easy to control the dosage unlike the creams that come in jars or tubes. The smell isn't that great but its worth it to smell funky and feel fantastic and cover it up with perfume or body spray than be a great smelling bad attitude panic attack explosion waiting to happen. Definitely recommend! Wonderful results,Neutral
I use this all over after showing and love it. It takes very little to do the trick and absorbs quickly. The scent is fine and not flowery so I don't feel like I am wearing perfume. I also use most nights and still feel soft the next morning. My very dry skin is looking better especially my legs.  I am also using the Tree Hut Shea scrub once a week which is helping. I love it,dry skin
My Mom used to use this to detangle my long hair when I was tiny (a L-O-N-G time ago).I bought this to de-tangle my Yorkie-Poos' Yorkie-fine but Poodly-curly hair that had matted slightly under their necks.  It worked GREAT and was less expensive than the pet equivalent detangler.The spray mister worked perfectly on my bottle; no problem with it dispensing properly.  I also like the fact that this isn't too heavily perfumed.  Just a pleasant fresh scent.  Another favorite Amazon Retro find! Great Classic De-Tangler; Scent is Pleasant Not Overpowering,long time
The problem I seem to have with most facial cleansers is that they work great for my skin-type for the spring/summer seasons but fail to live up to their reputation for when my skin changes to more of a dry dull appearance and feeling during the cold winter months. 'Clean & Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub' failed to give me any additional moisture for someone with my particular type of skin.ScentIf you close your eyes you honestly cannot tell the difference with the 'Clean & Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub' and your average body aches and pain/ointments. It honestly has a medicine type of aroma which I thought was quite yucky. Who wants to walk around with a product that is reminiscing of being in a medical facility? I was quite disappointed and was expecting something a bit more feminine not necessarily fruity; as I am not an advocate of perfume based cleansers for the face. Perfume and dyes have no place on one&#;s face; it tend to be drying and promotes breakouts. 'Clean & Clear Scrub' has an overbearing strong aroma and at times even 'stinging to the eyes;' not what I was expecting at all.Exfoliating ScrubThe exfoliating beads really seem to get deep down in my pores and provided a nice rich exfoliate experience that seemed to last. Washing with Luke-warm water made for an enjoyable mixture of the warm with the tingling-menthol undertones. It did seem to take some time to rinse; this can be quite time consuming especially if you are in a bit of a hurry but does lather quite well. The good news is the exfoliating scrub wasn't too harsh which I have found in other cleansers that often left my skin a bit 'reddish' as if I used a harsh abrasive. This can make for a bad exfoliating experience; since it opens up the pores and with cold weather conditions; this is asking for trouble/problematic skin (dryness/extreme dryness aging the skin and breakouts).This Review has been brought to you by 'Awakened'.** See all my reviews:http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAZBCCBLPN/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF&sort;_by=MostRecentReview Clean but Drying; Good Moisturizer Needed,Neutral
I'm usually a Burt's Bees girl but I wanted something with more color now Burt's Bees has apparently discontinued the Merlot shade of their colored balms. After LOTS of online searching I decided to try this and am so glad. The color is intense but sheer- could definitely apply more for a really deep rosy color but even one coat leaves a nice deep shine and the balm feels great on and hasn't left any kind of chapped feeling like I have got from glosses before. I wish it smelled even more like roses but maybe that would clash with perfume or taste funny but it is a pretty perfect treat of a gloss. The color is more of a deep cherry in the pot but on my lips at least the color is a sheer intense rose- just lovely. Love the color the feel and the mild scent.,Neutral
I'm a bit addicted to buying lip balms chapstick and glosses and this is one that I would buy again. It was light with a nice hint of color smelled/tasted good and is moisturizing. In my opinion it isn't as moisturizing as people are indicating. For a colored lip product it is a lot more moisturizing than most tinted lip balms stains or lip sticks. However it's no where near as moisturizing as plain chapstick or lip balm is. If you're looking for something deeply moisturizing to heal your dry cracked lips this probably isn't your best pick. If you're looking for a splash of color that isn't sticky or drying then you'll likely love this. I got it in the Jasmine (which smells like cotton candy) and love it. Would recommend.EDIT: After having the Jasmine for a while and loving it I decided I would try another color. I've never had success with the whole red lipstick thing but like the look on others so I decided I would try Wild Rose for a hint of red color. I'm disappointed that I did!! The color is fine but if you put on more than the slightest dab it looks clownish. And the little dab that gives a good amount of color does nothing as far as moisturization. It's not something that you would want to apply without a mirror available either. And then there's the smell...it does smell like wild rose as it's named but it's a very strange perfume-y smell...not something that I want to be wearing on my lips (I feel like the scent would be fine in a body lotion or perfume but not something that you wear on your face). The smell is sort of nauseating and doesn't taste good at all. Disappointed in the Wild Rose and sad that I wasted my money...I should have just got another thing of the jasmine! Good stuff!,Neutral
Great lotion!  This is a super value there is no smell and it leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  I like to use this and then follow up with my expensive perfume matching lotion in a few key areas.  This way I get to save my expensive lotion and still be nice and soft! Nice!,Neutral
My hands elbows and sometimes my arms get really dry. I purchased this lotion because the price was good for the size it's unscented- so it won't clash at all with any of the perfumes that I wear and it says that it's good for sensitive skin.Well I have been using this lotion for the last several months and while I can say that the bottle has lasted me a very long time I can't say that the reasons for that are all good. This lotion seemed to be okay to use during the Summer when my skin was naturally a little oily from the heat; but during the Fall and Winter seasons this lotion just didn't cut it for me at all. I have found myself going back to the lotion that I used to use.I will keep the remainder of the this Alba Botanica lotion to use on my legs when I need it but I won't repurchase it once I run out. This lotion is just not for me,long time
I have been on an organic kick and read up on how certain ingredients can coat your skin making it feel smooth but not actually giving it moisture. I get really dry skin especially in the desert. I would itch so badly that it was leaving scars on my skin..I got the Alba Botanica in hopes of saving my skin. I can tell you that it will help with your moisture needs HOWEVER I have two complaints.The first being the consistency. It felt greasy and is VERY runny. (Maybe it's just mine.) Because it feels greasy to me I avoid using it on my face. And just remember a little bit goes a long way. I had to learn this the hard way when I put the normal amount that I usually use with lotion on my legs and used WAY too much. I had to keep finding places on my body to put the lotion!The second is the smell of this lotion. I liked the fact that it states unscented but believe me it is far from. And it's not a pleasant scent either. The only way that I can compare it to is Elmer's glue. I thought it wasn't that noticeable until my fiance asked me what the heck that smell was... So now when I put it on I make sure to do it after I spray my perfume on in hopes that it masks the smell.Besides these complaints the product itself for what it is intended for (moisturizing) does not disappoint. It contains aloe vera which does not help all with their sunburns but it certain did wonders for mine. My arms get burnt pretty easily and within a day I no longer have redness or peeling. Green tea extracts are used to wake up your skin which this definitely does. After one days use my legs skin felt softer. Different But Not In a Bad Way,little bit
I usually don't buy lotions (especially in a large size like this!) without first smelling them since I can be sensitive to smells but I went ahead and bought this lotion sight unseen (scent unsmelled?!) based the reviews.  I've used Alba Botanical products in the past and have always loved them and this one is great too!The lotion is nice and thick but it sinks right in so that you don't feel greasy and your skin doesn't feel heavy at all after using it.  Also the scent is very very light and subtle; it doesn't compete with my perfume and is definitely gender-neutral.  In fact the scent fades away after a few minutes of applying it.Another big plus is that I can use this on my legs right after shaving and it doesn't burn as I was afraid it would because of the alpha-hydroxy acids in it.I've been looking for an SPF lotion that was lighter-feeling and this one is definitely great.  I've used Kiehl's SPF body lotion in the past but it's the same price for a bottle that is half as big as this Alba one.  I've also tried Lubriderm's SPF lotion but that one felt too thick for me.  This is a nice compromise!UPDATE //:  I've been using this a few weeks now and just love it!  It has made my skin so soft even on those troublesome places like my elbows which are usually really rough.  I will definitely be buying this again once I run out. Nice thick lotion that sinks right in,Neutral
I'm on my third bottle of this lotion.  Just like the title says it's very emollient and one of the only SPF body lotions out there. It's nice and thick yet absorbs quickly and not at all greasy. There's no smell to compete with my perfume.  The pump always works great on the bottle.  PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE SUN!  I highly recommend this wonderful lotion.  At a great price too you can't go wrong. My favorite lotion,Neutral
I like this bath gel a lot.Most bath-gels are heavy with cloying perfumes (thanks but I'm a guy and I REALLY don't want to smell like lavender and vanilla all day) or heavy musks (because it's for a guy it has to smell like woodsmoke and musk??) and excessive other ingredients (I'll moisturize later thanks).Unlike all of those THIS gel smells nice but neutral (no lingering perfume at all) it's reasonably priced at about the third the price of products from Bath&Body; Works it makes you feel clean.  It's not drying doesn't leave any coating on your skin the pump is easy to use.  Straightforward effective and while it's neutral enough for the guys it's pleasant and gentle enough for the girls.In my mind this puts the Alba gel somewhere between soaps and the traditional fragrance-and-moisturizer-laden gels aimed at a female demographic.  Kudos to them for making a product that fills that gaping hole in the market that everyone else seems to ignore. The local natural grocer is often sold out of this Alba gel so apparently others feel the same way.  Try it and see if you do! Pleasing well-priced bath gel,Neutral
i bought this as one of my bronzers in my lotion rotation.  i think the smell is just ok ... it's weird and perfume-y in my opinion.the ATO is AWFUL!!! my boyfriend always knew when i'd go tanning because he could smell it.i got a medium brown with this but it didn't get me black like it suggests! meh,Neutral
I read all of the customer reviews before I bought this and they all conflicted but I still wanted to give it a try. After I placed the order I asked the manager at the tanning salon what she knew about the brand and she told me to never buy tanning lotion off the Internet that it could be anything in that bottle. Maybe that was just her wanting me to buy from the salon- when I showed it to her she did have to eat her words...she admitted it was authentic but couldn't place the smell. One review said this smells like warm vanilla sugar- my bottle does not. Another said it had a subtle fresh scent and afterwards didnt experience that after-tan smell. That was confirmed...I stopped at a gas station right after tanning and the guy working asked what perfume I was wearing! I already had a good base tan but had reached a plateau and wasn't getting any darker that's what made me want to buy this some reviews said it's just wonderful and they are so much more tan etc. It does have good moisturizer. I've left my Mom and BFF both use it and they like it. And the smell? I have Shout gel stain remover...that's the closest I can think of to describing the smell..but thats not a bad smell... Wasnt really sure...,Neutral
I have very fine shoulder length hair. This product really does give me extra volume and my hair feels thicker when I use it. I have found this works a little better than drug store brands but I probably wouldn't buy it again because the price is so high (I paid $. for it at a local store).I use less than the recommended amount otherwise it is just way too much product.I took off one star for the very strong smell. I am sensitive to smells and this one is very strong and perfume-like until your hair dries. Great for Fine Hair!,Neutral
This oil has a light velvety feel to it. I put it on first thing in the morning to rehydrate my winter dry facial skin adding a drop or two of Helichrysum oil and it absorbs right into my skin. The smell is nice but not really noticeable. I'm hypersensitive to smells don't wear any perfume except for a few favorite Essential Oils and I get along nicely with this one. The dropper didn't work well even after I tried opening it up with a straight pin but I just popped it out and I carefully pour a small pool into the palm of my hand. The price is right and I will be reordering. Nice light facial oil,Neutral
Ordered this on a whim and I stopped using commercial perfumes with chemicals.This oil is AMAZING. I constantly get stopped out in public with peopleasking what I use in my hair and as a body perfume. I notice people at worksniffing me. (Weirdos!) Awesome for your skin and pores and amazingjust as a perfume in itself.Get it! Non-irritating and gentle and I even made some body oil for my newbornnieces with this and their mom loves it. Its like a earthy-lavendar-rosemary type of smell.In love! Love it so much its on my subscribe and save list. ;) Great oil and high quality,Neutral
I started using this as a hair tonic and am very happy to see it's starting to work already. The smell is not all that great not that it's offensive either but it just doesn't have the perfume smell of other scented oils . Regardless I can certainly put up with that if it helps strengthen my hair anyway you use it at night and wash it out in the am. Hair toni,Neutral
If you've never tried this fragrance you owe it to yourself to give it a shot!This is a very soft and clean baby powder type scent. Its not at all overwhelming or perfumey. It smells very subtle and clean. I know so many women want to smell sexy these days and if thats your thing you probably won't like this fragrance.I am back to basics at this point in my life and this fragrance fits the bill in every way. Try it!! The best !!,Neutral
I've worn this since the s when I turned thirteen. It and Estee Lauder Youth Dew were my first-ever perfumes. It's a classic perfect for any age. Sweet floral flirty scent. Lovely sweet scent,Neutral
I was first introduced to this perfume as a going-away gift after I worked as a Graduate Student rehabilitation counseling intern many years ago for several months at a vocational rehabilitation counseling facility. I worked under five supervisors/bosses and had to report to each of them each week while teaching and counseling the facility's patients. Anyways I had great rapport with all my co-workers bosses and clientele and they gave me great going-away presents such as rare Care Bear stuffed toys nice writing utensils various American Eagle company winter accessories and jewelry nice local BBQ lunch pomegranate fruit and various Avon products including this perfume. The head boss frankly told me the reason why she gave me this perfume. She said that she considered me a sweet and honest person when I served as a counselor there. She said that I was one of the few individuals who told her upfront my honest opinions about how the workplace and the workplace environment could be improved and that I did it in a nice constructive friendly sweet way instead of in a harsh mean way as some past employees. Anyways what she said was honestly one of the best compliments I've received because she trusted and valued my sincere honesty remarks and opinions. Anyways you can see why this cologne spray holds sentimental value to me. I own a lot of more expensive perfumes but this cheaper in cost fragrance holds more value and meaning to me. It goes beyond cosmetic/beauty value for me. I love the fact that it's youthful light and subtle-smelling. I can't stand strong powerful fragrances. This Sweet Honesty fragrance is just right. If you know a sweet honest opinionated woman who likes wearing light fragrances then this would be a great fragrance to give as a gift. I think this would make an excellent gift for employees co-workers birthdays graduations etc. I highly recommend this fragrance from Avon. Nice Fragrance,Neutral
I have been futility trying to find something that can replace my old stand-by extra hold hairspray by Joico Mist (which seems to have had a formula change) and finally came upon this one.It holds like the dickens-up to  hours is easy to wash out does not flake as the day passes and does not have an overbearing aroma. (it will not interfere with your perfume).  I get  hour hold.  However be careful when first trying it.  It can be easy to 'over use' this product and turn your hairstyle into a helmet head. What I was Looking For,Neutral
I have been wearing this scent since it was first introduced and I receive nothing but compliments on my perfume.This scent is so unique!  It's floral and fruity and fresh and crisp.Most of the men that I worked with would always say that I smelled amazing and that's not a bad thing to hear from time to time. Fresh & Unique Fragrance,Neutral
This is my all time favorite perfume.  I have very bad allergies and many perfumes seem to be nice initially but end up irritating my nose and eyes as I wear it through the day.  I can wear this every day and enjoy the light scent without any problems.  It does seem to be a bit more subtle than other perfumes which my husband likes because he doesn't like to be assaulted by my perfume every time I walk by.  This was available at a great price too!  Thanks Amazon! All time favorite perfume.,favorite perfume
Absolutely love this scent. I'm not a fan of citrusy and overly fresh scents in general and I love oriental woodsy warm and sweet perfumes (Lolita Lempicka being my all-time favorite). However I find that this perfume combines warmth citrus freshness and sweetness - all in one bottle in a wonderful harmony. Yes it is a fresh scent but it's a very warm fresh. And yes it is citrusy also but it's a lovely sweet citrus (as opposed to many citrusy perfumes smelling outright SOUR which I hate). I first smelled Infusion D'Iris at Macy's a while ago and kept thinking about how beautiful the scent was until I had to buy it. Of course not to mention that Aamazon.com price beats all the others combined with super fast FREE shipping. Thanks Amazon! Lovely Prada Perfume,Neutral
WOW! How can I praise this fragrance? In my OWN words this is most feminine fresh and sexy fragrance out there! I am a BIG perfume lover and I have tried and still do try every fragrance out there. This one remains in my TOP  for several years now. I am a female in my late 's and honestly I have progressed from poison like smelling scents to fresh and clean floral scents and absolutely love this one. The scent lingers on for long long time and after you put it on about a minute later it starts smelling even better once it diffuses a bit in the air. My other top two along with this one are Chancel Tendre and Cashmere Mist and they are all in the same category. The design of the bottle is extremely simply and classy and it's not bulky at all unlike some other .oz bottles. Fits in my purse makeup bag and easy to take on travel. I usually stock up on this before it's even finished and I wear it nearly every day! Always getting complements on the scent too wherever I go. CLEAN. FRESH. ELEGANT,Neutral
I'm generally not a fan of super woodsy perfumes but this fragrance is the exception. The cedar notes aren't overpowering and balance nicely with the iris scent which is lovely. The perfume is also very long-lasting and a little of the product goes a long way so you don't have to constantly reapply throughout the day. I definitely recommend this fragrance. Great scent,long way
Though classified as a floral scent Infusion D'Iris is much more sofisticated and unlike anything else you can find in a department store. It has that small boutique feel. When I spray the perfume on my body the most recognizable top notes are iris cedar and incense balanced by greenery. The resulting olfactory sensation evokes a memory of being caught in a warm rain in a cedar wood with the ground covered with blooming irises. Warm pleasant and light but long lasting. On occasion I can feel it linger thru the following morning while I undress for a shower.There is a difference when someone says to you you smell so good vs. your perfume smells so good... When wearing Infusion D'Iris the first compliment is the one I get most often. The perfume does NOT overwhelm the person. Which is great if you work in a tight environment. Your co-workers will thank you ;o).The only downside I can think of is that the scent is now gaining in popularity. My consolation is that its prevailing notes do seem to change significantly depending on the individual wearer's body chemistry (unlike Eternity for example which is VERY recognizable regardless on whom it is). It is a light scent that is warm enough to do well in the winter months as well. Enjoy! Rain falling on cedars...,Neutral
This has continued to be my favorite perfume for a whole lifetime. It's hard to find these days in stores. No one seems to carry fine perfume around here so it was nice to find it on Amazon for as good a price as I've seen. My favorite scent,favorite perfume
El producto lleg&oacute; perfectamente sellado el frasco es original y para ser agua de colonia tiene un olor perdurable. Agradezco que cuando tenga agua de perfume o perfume me avise porque me interesar&iacute;a comprarlo.Gracias Muy bien,Neutral
We - as in the entire family - have been using Neutrogena's sunblock spray for at least  years and we've been happy with it whether at home by the pool or at the beach including some tropical ones where we use the higher SPF versions. Besides helping us avoid sunburns and it does there are a few more reasons that made this product our favorite.- It's a spray - this makes it easy to apply. I wouldn't call applying sunblock 'fun' but spraying is less of a chore than rubbing it in.- There's no need to rub it in - yes we do use a light rub after spraying to even the distribution but it's mostly to avoid wasting it.- No oily goo on your skin - which partially explains why rubbing it in is not mandatory. This spray is remarkably oil-free.- Swimming pool friendly (see above) - not much oil in it which allows our entire family to use the pool with the sunblock.- No overpowering smell - it does smell a little like 'vacation' but even if you spray it in a room the smell goes away rather quickly and while it stays it's not unpleasant.- Friendly to my skin - I tend to be allergic to things on my skin that contain perfumes but I don't mind Neutrogena's sunblock at all. There is no PABA in this product.- Water/sweat resistant - it's true.- Effective for several hours - even after swimming. I use to reapply a little after a second swim but even though I sometimes forget I haven't been burned literally speaking in quite a while.The one claim the maker makes and I dispute is the 'resists running into eyes'. I don't even understand what 'resists running' means but I would NOT have this applied anywhere near my eyes because if it does run into your eyes it WILL hurt. We are actually using theNeutrogena Healthy Defense Sunblock Stickaround the eyes.It's probably worth noting that this is a Helioplex-based sunblock which is the main ingredient. I looked it up and it turns out it's formulated to provide UVA/UVB skin protection and it contains Avobenzone (for protection) and Oxybenzone (to help make it stay effective longer). Our standard sunblock for the past  years,Neutral
I prefer spray sunblock because they are easy to apply.  This can sprays upside down and sideways.  It is a bit strong in the scent department but I did not find it particularly unpleasant.  It's like wearing strong perfume.Neutragena body mist does feel refreshing when applying it in searing heat but it could use improvements in a couple of areas: it does not dry instantly and it left my skin with a sticky residue.One  ounce can only lasted my daughter and me about a month and we use a total of   applications between us a week.  The sun in our area of Southern California can be intense with temperatures this week hovering near  degrees.  My daughter's skin is medium tone.  She is swimming in that sun and she hasn't burned yet.This product works. Works but needs improvement,Neutral
was surprised by the aroma but I love it so much I use it daily for myself and it arrived on time and in great shape perfume,Neutral
This is the second time that i've used this perfume and i keep loving it. I got i perfect conditions and if u wanna smell fresh all day this will be the right frangance for u. I love it,Neutral
I dont know the smell of the original so I cant compare it. But on its own it has a great smell. Mixed floral notes and not heavy at all. It goes on with a bit of power and then after abut  minutes becomes more subtle and a hour later it had mixed nicely with the natural skin scent. I think the designer used a variety of scents to come up with this. I bought  varieties of 'impression' type sprays in this order and of them I would rate this as something that should have it's own brand. How the pump will hold up won't be known for some time but the perfume alone even at a higher price I would give  stars. Glad I got  bottles. Arrived very fast and smeels great,Neutral
I love this perfume it smells just like the original just cheaper! I got mine for $ the price went up now but this perfume is worth trying out Great Duplicate:),Neutral
My heading says it all.  I get compliments all the time on this perfume.  And I am a person who loves and wears a lot of perfume.  However none of the perfumes I wear get the reaction this one gets.  I think it's because it has a beachy smell that appeals to most people. Perhaps it gives them warm happy memories of being carefree on the beach with lots of happy scantily clad people having fun!  Whatever the case I can't wear it without hearing &#;You smell good!&#; several times from various people I encounter.When I wear it I feel like I am in Hawaii and should be wearing a lei and/or a flower in my hair.  I'm into that vibe though so it works for me!  It's like automatic vacation! Heavenly smell!  Tons of compliments.,Neutral
I absolutely LOVE this scent. It is glorious. So heavenly. Almost unbelievably delicious.Okay MAYBE I'm going a little overboard with the compliments but seriously this is the best smelling perfume EVER. I don't care how much money you have to spend I don't care what the $+ perfumes smell like or if you're fool enough to spend that amount of money on it -THIS one is the very best.Lavanila popped up on my radar last Christmas season when I made the decision to throw out ALL of my chemical-filled paraben-filled cancer-magnet products. If the FDA won't do its job anymore (I mean have you heard of GMOs???? Do you KNOW who quite literally runs our FDA now? Google the word that is: MONSANTO) that doesn't mean I am willingly going to let myself be exposed to that junk. When you know better you do better and I definitely now KNOW better.I have replaced literally ALL of my products from cleaning products (Dr. Bronner's for EVERYTHING; mopping floors cleaning countertops kitchen bathrooms it even cleans glass streak-free when its diluted properly) to beauty products to cosmetics hair products EVERYTHING. And I am NOT a victim of &#;greenwashing&#; (faker and wannabe products that advertise like they are clean and good and everything ---and then you read the ingredient list and it's &#;cancer causing this&#; & &#;cancer causing that.&#; Um NO). I am a smarty-pants label reader extraordinaire and will not be taken in by the Poser-products.Perfume came at the very end of my 'REPLACE LIST' along with hairspray nail polish & nail polish remover (which the brand Honeybee Gardens came to rescue with those products very nicely and I highly recommend them). Unfortunately I had the HARDEST time finding perfume which I'll admit is a luxury not a necessity however it's something that when I got down to the end of my list I was determined to find.Enter Lavanila Healthy Fragrances.These babies are NOT at all inferior to their petro-chemical cancer magnet counterparts (try saying that  times fast). :-) They are absolutely DELICIOUS. Especially this one.My first Lavanila purchase was the very safe Pure Vanilla in the 'set' that comes with the body butter deodorant and perfume spray (I believe the bottle is  oz). These smell good and honestly if you're going to order online without getting to smell them first (the way I did) simply for the same reasons I did (you too perhaps are a smarty-pants label-reader cancer-avoider infiltrated FDA-thumbing Monsanto/Biotech-hating modern girl trying to avoid the chemical smorgasbord in conventional perfumes) I would say that it is a very nice purchase and smells really wonderful like real pure vanilla (which it actually IS) and both the deodorant and body butter are not only great products but are also really pretty to look at (which I really appreciate). HOWEVER I would also tell you to FIND the nearest Sephora call them until you find one that carries the all the Lavanila perfumes and then go try all of them yourself to find which one you like best. And if you can't do that I would tell you simply that THIS ONE is IT. THIS one smells the very very best. Again I don't want to lay it on too thick so I'll just say This one is the BEST. It smells absolutely magnificent/amazing. You will love it. It is like paradise on your skin and if you spray it in your hair that scent will stay with you until you literally shampoo it out. It stays on skin and clothing for hours as well lasting through the day.I am literally ECSTATIC over this product if you can't tell already. It is absolutely amazing.I am amazed once again that in a GREAT many things that I have replaced the &#;natural&#; counterparts are actually WAY better than the products that I bought for years and years thinking they were safe (when of course they are not again the FDA does not do its job anymore and does not work for 'us' anymore).This is definitely one of those products.So I guess I'm saying if you're looking for a healthy perfume you can put on your skin without worry and are looking to purchase a Lavanila product the Pure Vanilla IS really good but if you want to be a risk taker get THIS one it's better. It's awesome. It's the best smelling Lavanila perfume out of the whole collection and I have smelled them all at my local Sephora. Lavanila Lemon comes in second after this one tied with Lavanila Pure Vanilla. This one takes the TOP spot though. And no it doesn't smell like coconut (like I thought it would) it smells like Heaven on your skin.If you tried/used the Bath & Body Works Bronze Bombshell back when they used to sell it it smells very similar only way better. It's amazing. And it's clean. :-) Get THIS one!,Neutral
I am obsessed with Lavanila perfumes. The Vanilla Coconut is one of my favorites. It smells very sweet. It does not smell like tanning lotion like most coconut fragrances do. I find it does smell more vanilla than coconut but I do not mind. It also last all day. I apply it in the morning and I can still smell it on my wrist at the end of the day. I am also obsessed with the new Vanilla Lemon scent. I really like this,Neutral
I love the Dial Complete foaming hand wash.  It smells clean without smelling perfume laden.  It foams as advertised!  It cleans my hands without overdrying.  And most importantly it rinses clean.I'm disappointed that you can no longer buy the refills on Amazon and would typically rate this five stars but the price often is the same as a slightly larger bottle from the store.The price flluxuates a lot so keep your eye on it and buy when it is reasonably low! Foamtastic!,Neutral
I like that this item has washing texture and lavender aroma.I have started this item twice I have used this item since now. Lavender perfume,Neutral
It's a good perfume and texture.I like it.But When it's dicreased I'm disappointed thatIt's not easy to put out. It is not easy to put out,Neutral
I've been using this bag for over a month and I've grown to appreciate it more and more.  I used a tinted see-through cosmetic bag for several years and then received a lovely bag as a gift and started using it but I was always digging to find what I needed.  Having thrown away the first bag I ordered this clear one and I will never use any other material.  I go right to what I'm looking for - specific lipstick safety pin mini perfume mirror mascara eye drops . . . . recommend highly! Clear See Through Bag Has Made My Life Easier,Neutral
This is great for anyone who makes their own perfumes.  It's also excellent for taking your favorite scents with out when you travel.  The containers don't leak I haven't had any problems with the nozzles clogging and the bottles are small enough that you can easily pack them and not worry about space. Great for Purfumes,Neutral
Bottles and  the funnel was very useful and it came in handy.I haven't notice any leakage on the bottles and I check for the robber area where liquid would come out (the plastic around the neck of the bottle) and it is intact.I did order  bottles and I have a tendency of keeping my bottles upright even on my purse so I'm not sure I'll ever have the drama of having perfume leak all over. :-)Maybe with the funnel all you need it's patience to pour into the bottle. Very cute,Neutral
I smelled this on another woman and was impressed and decided to purchase . I get beaucoup compliments EVERY time I leave the house wearing it . This is floral fruity and musky  and not for a shrinking violet female . It is not so intense that it is offensive but it is feminine  sultry  and SEXY !! It is a fragrance even a grandma like me can love or a younger ingenue . I can not imagine ever tiring of it and I am a perfume junky .Ladies this is classy and gets attention ! One of the best scents I have ever encountered - a masterpiece fragrance . To Die For,Neutral
This perfume is great as i bought many times for my family members. Also it makes a great gift for anytime. Calvin Klein perfume spray for women,Neutral
This product is heavily perfumed (I mean like sneezing - at least for me - and I'm not super-sensitive).  I didn't want to waste it so I worked hard at finishing the entire bottle which I finally have.  It does an adequate job in terms of adding moisture but nothing extraordinary.  I'd say that if you generally don't like strong perfumes them don't bother with this product at all.  If you may not mind depending on the smell then try to sample somehow (like at your beauty supply or salon if they carry it).  Otherwise if you're pretty easy going about fragrances then its okay. Strong fragrance!!!!,Neutral
Ala Botanica's Hawaiian Papaya Mango Body Cream is an excellent lightweight moisturizer. It keeps all parts of my body properly moisturized throughout the day. What I like most about this product is that it feels more like a souffle than a cream. It sinks into my skin instantly and doesn't leave it feeling greasy. My only criticism is the artificial fragrance - it smells more perfumey and floral rather than fruity. Light body cream that moisturizes well.,Neutral
I just got this color In the mail about an hour ago and I was so excited to use it......WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! The only good thing is that it dries very quickly & it has no shimmer as well as it does not look clumpy after  or  coats but the smell is just horrible and I have applied THREE coats and I can still see through the color and see my nail!!!...I don't know why people have said two coats is enough because it's totally NOT! I wish I could post a picture of how it looks on the nail! I'm so sad I waited what I wasted on this I'm going to return it because I believe the color was mixed with extra thinning liquid or as if was an imitation like what is done with many perfumes. Im returning it!,Neutral
i love this smell and use the shampoo also. This lotion is great in leu of perfume and lasts all day. One tub lasted me several months. Great lotion if you love the smell of Lush's Karma line,Neutral
I am a huge fan of Lush- This body cream is my favorite! It smells for hours and smells sooo good on my skin. I get compliments all the time more then with my normal perfume. The perfume doesn't smell as good on my skin this product is pricey but a total winner!!! Love Love Love this scent and body cream!!!,Neutral
This is Lush's Karma scent now in a body lotion.  The scent translates pretty well from perfume to lotion and the lotion smells much like the perfume (little scent mutation here).  The lotion formula is light.  For me this is not a lotion for the depths of winter but works out quite nicely in the summer.  At the end of the day I'm pretty much meh about this product.  It works well enough it smells nice enough but I'm not going to go out of my way to purchase again either especially given that it's quite an expensive lotion. Okay but probably not worth the price,Neutral
I am hyper-sensitive to fake perfumes and fragrances. I canot use petroleum-based perfumes (although natural smells don't bother me if they are plant-derived) and a lot of creams are either:. Too runny and don't do anything for my severely dry skin OR. Have acidic properties that cause red bumps or fake perfumes that turn my stomachThis product is the answer; it does everything it promises. And it's a reasonably-priced cream for all it does. I use it all over and especially after I have been in the pool with my toddler. Although I use a Clinique skin cream for my face I have used LUSH (lightly) on my face when I was travelling. It did not cause me any irritation even on my face.My toddler has dry scaly bumpy skin on his knees. This works great as a protective cream and the scaliness on his knees completely went away after three days of continued use.Recommended! This is a WONDER CREAM for sensitive skin!,dry skin
I couldn't help but write this review as I just loved this perfume after trying it at Dillard's. The next day the smell stayed on my wrist even after taking a shower! Very spicy and intriguing smell. The only other perfume that comes closer to this is Burbery. Highly recommended. One of the best I have ever used !!!!!!,Neutral
I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  I have a very sensitive nose when it comes to perfumes so I wanted something with a light scent to replace his drugstore colognes.  I tried this at the department store then came to Amazon for the best price.  It's a nice light scent.  Masculine but not overwhelmingly so.  I could probably wear this as a female. not an overwhelming scent,Neutral
Versace Bright Crystal reminds me of a garden of roses.  It has a heavenly scent and would agree with most women's keen floral scent appreciation.  The jar it comes in is overly attractive - jars personally do nothing for me when it comes to judging the aromatic flavors of a good parfum.  I'd rather have LESS jar and better parfum.  The sillage of Bright Crystal is average but like I stated above most women like this Eau De Toilette. I purchased my bottle at perfume.com for . oz for $. NO shipping & handling charges. A Garden of Roses,Neutral
I got this small bottle for my mom for Christmas because she doesn't usually wear a lot of perfume.  She likes body mists like from B&BW but this size was perfect for her.  Unfortunately she pulled the top off completely and took the little metal spray piece with that wide cover but we are getting it fixed soon.  So be gentle with it!  Other than that great size great scent.  Love it! So Cute!,Neutral
I'm so glad I could find a small affordable bottle of this EDT before considering a full-size bottle.This is a wonderful very light and fresh fragrance that is super easy to wear in hot weather. It is definitely not a statement making perfume or a particularly unforgettable one but it is very inoffensive and just plain clean smelling; it's the type of scent I believe everyone should have in their fragrance wardrobe. The citrus (yuzu) stands out on me the most. It's perfect for wearing in the office because it is such a light EDT so it's not as strong as an actual perfume. I feel like I need to use more of it since it's so light but I don't really mind. Someone called it a glorified body mist but I have to disagree. Body mist disappears on me within the hour while this fragrance lingers until the rest of the day though it is very close to the skin. It's perfect for people who are really sensitive to smell too.I'm definitely considering getting a bigger bottle of this fragrance for the summer.EDIT: I gave in and purchased a oz bottle of this lovely perfume; it's slowly become one of my absolute favorites. I'd also like to add that this perfume is quite similar to Dior Addict  - Addict  is the sweeter fruitier non-aquatic sister of Versace Bright Crystal. Perhaps you will love both like I do. Perfect Fresh Scent for the Hot Summer,Neutral
Purchase was good. Delivered within time frame. The sent is very light. Watery. Fresh. Just OK scent. Not something I'd wear to make me feel like wearing a perfume. Very unnoticeable. Watery light scent,Neutral
I used to wear this in middle school and high school. After the store I used to buy it at closed i couldn't find it in town anywhere. I have tried to find it for a long time so when I saw it on her I was excited. But.... It smells differently than it used to. Not a huge difference but it was my favorite perfume so it is a little disappointing. You do get a large bottle though so that is a good thing. I just wished it smelt the same. Doesn't smell the same....,favorite perfume
I've had many compliments when wearing this perfume.  When they ask what it is and I tell them Usher they're a little surprised that a woman of my age () would wear this.  However it has a light fresh fragrance that doesn't over power you. UR by Usher,Neutral
i love love love this smell. I use to be skeptical about buying perfume over the internet before i smell it. but this smell is amazing USHER yesssssssss,Neutral
I have this perfume. I am not sure what kind they are smelling????-But I am hear to tell you IT SMELLS GREAT!!!!Smells soft feminine very lightly Floral lightly Oriental a fresh-aquatic smell and has a very lasting wear on the skin it doesn't wear off.I am thinking the reviews are towards this company. For the record I own a few  great perfumes in my collection they are among others: poison Givenchy Thierry Mugler Dior Cartier and Versace perfumes...so I do know a good smelling scent when I smell one!!!This goes to show you that you can't too much depend on a review's.WHAT A GREAT PRICE I AM GOING TO BUY ANOTHER ONE...WHEN I run short...here on AMAZON. Bad Reviews BULL!!,Neutral
I like Usher as artist but boy I was very skeptical about him borrowing his name for a female perfume.  I received a sample of the perfume during one of my larger orders.  And - oh boy - was I up for a surprise!  This is a fabulous scent!!  Nice and clean and long lasting. It contains red currant pink freesia and apple blossom; a heart of frangipani apricot nectar blooming jasmine and passion rose; drydown of amber wood sensual musk cashmere wood vanilla orchid and incense. When I read ingredients - it absolutely scared me.  I just thought there is too many of them and scent would be too heavy with musk orchid and cashmere wood.  But this is great perfume and one can get it at great price.  Not I am hoping to find body lotion if they make one.  I would love to use it! Great scent,Neutral
i didnt like the way this smelled it turned into my perfume to my boyfriends cologne no thanks usher just sing please not for me,Neutral
Now this is different. You mix it with water and pour it over your hair. It's not a pretty color and it doesnt smell all perfumey. But It works really well. I like this,Neutral
I've been using this product for several years and have tried some other hairsprays as well but this is the best because) It literally makes your hair several times thicker) It smells so good that people will ask you if they can come up and smell you) You can go a couple days without showering and not feel greasy) It's very strong but not ridiculously stiff-feeling) It doesn't take much so a bottle lasts a long timeThe only possible drawback to this product is you might not want to wear it if your perfume is not similarly fruity. But it smells so good you don't even need perfume. Smells delicious makes hair twice as thick.,Neutral
I tried an impostor version that Walmart had....and I loved the smell of that body spray.I actually search for the name and found it in here Amazon.com....then I saw the small traveling tube and I decided to purchase it.THe day I received it it was the day I applied this amazing perfume... I LOVE IT.I apply it after my showerand weird enough I even applied it when I go to bed it is SUCH a delicate soft and casual smell it does NOT bother my nose or have I gotten a headache alike other perfumes can cause.I definably recommended this product (perfume) if you like the light scent.I am actually looking forward to try the blossom version :-)Jazz Walmart version,Neutral
Love this perfume and really like the portable factor!  I own the large bottle of Be Delicious but don't like taking it on trips for fear of it breaking.  This little gem gets tucked right in and I don't worry at all.  The seller also sent me a mini bottle of Ooh La La perfume (had never heard of) which was nice as well.  Yea for rollerball! Excellent for travel!,Neutral
Love my DKNY and now I can have it on the go.  This is the perfect size to fit into my purse of hand bag.  It has a great roller ball for quick application and I do love this perfume so this was a must. Apple on the go,Neutral
I've used this product  times since buying it a few days ago and so far it seems kinda ok.  I'm not so sure it provides enough hold on my hair and I'm not sure if maybe I'm not spraying enough of it on my hair.  I don't expect it to give an Aquanet type of hold but at least some type of hold & so far I haven't seen that.  I have to experiment more with it-this alone sends up red flags for me if I have to do this if it's not doing what it claims to do after the first try.PROS:Has a pleasant smell almost like a light sweet perfume smell not overpowering smells pretty good.The spray is lightweight not a sharp heavy spray like a regular heavy hairspray would have the nozzle is very easy to press doesn't take much effort to press down.Bottle is easy to store looks nice isn't a large bulky hairspray bottle.  Looks cool on my dresser.Doesn't leave my hair sticky or oily.CONS:Doesn't really provide much of a hold although this has yet to be determined as I'm not sure if I'm spraying enough of it though I believe I am but we shall see.Doesn't provide any type of shine although I'm not sure if it claims to give shine so I can't really totally knock it for that one yet.Seems to weigh my hair down sometimes but I'm not sure if that's from using too much.  Too much or too little this product confuses me not sure if I need to spray more on to give more hold and not sure if I need to use less since it makes my hair weighed down sometimes.I have very thick hair so I may need to use more on my hair it may have to do with the hair type in terms of who it works for. Mixed Feelings,Neutral
Don't let the reviews that say this is for teens or someone under  sway you away. I'm older than that and after discovering this gem for my thick curly hair (after years of expensive name brand products that DONOTWORK)....I can't recommend it enough. I'm sensitive to smells and I never notice any lingering stink or perfume from these hair products.There are so many ways you can use this wonderful product if you apply it to wet/damp curly hair and let it air dry you get glossy defined curls with no frizz. If you are blowdrying your hair it leaves you with manageable shiny hair. It also acts great as a setting lotion if you like curlers. It's so versatile and if you have frizzy dry curly hair you really MUST try it. And you might have to use a quarter-size dollop or so but don't be afraid of it.I actually start with the Crazysleek protectant rub in some Smooth Operator lightly blow dry and then spritz my still-damp hair with Kinkier (all by GotB). My hair looks fabulous all day!If straightening I start with the Crazysleek and a little Smooth Operator blow dry straight as possible spray in the  protectant and then go to town with the flatiron.Always great!  And Walgreens has them BG once or twice a year so they are a real bargain! Big Bang for Little Buck!,Neutral
I've tried this as both an Unscented product and added to perfumes.It's a very popular product for many people on the LP forum butunfortunately it doesn't do anything for me :(I didn't get any self-effects and I didn't see any difference aroundothers but maybe it was just mild or I didn't test it enough.Oh well! There's plenty of other pheromones from Love Potion that haveworked for me (like Lumina TMI and Drop Your Guard.) Unfortunately Popularity Potion doesn't work for me :(,Neutral
This is a great deal! These usually run close to $ in stores so when I saw the  pack had savings I had to snatch it up. One for me and the other  for my friends with birthdays coming up soon. I've always used the Hawaiian Kukui  oz but always wanted to try another scent. This one is perfect for summer. Its not overwhelmingly strong with coconut like some products can be. It is less oily than the Hawaiian Kukui one. If your skin is dryer than do the Hawaiian Kukui scrub. If your skin isn't dry and you're more prone to breaking out because of added natural oils then try this one. Exfoliates just as well as the Hawaiian Kukui version. Skin is left soft smooth and lightly scented. Shouldn't clash with other lotions and perfumes you may wear. Tree Hut Shea Sugar Coconut Lime,Neutral
I have been loyal to the Britney Spears fragrance line (I absolutely love and recommend Curious Fantasy and Circus Fantasy) and received this item for Christmas. I was very excited and expected something great but was disappointed by the scent of Believe. It smells like an old lady's perfume. I would not recommend purchasing this if you are expecting something young and fresh. Don't really like the smell at all.,Neutral
BELIEVE opens with a sweetly fruity burst of guava pulp and tangerine. Sweet but not sickly sweet. It's not as overpowering in it's sweetness as FANTASY IN CONTROL or MIDNIGHT FANTASY.It's the middle notes of honeysuckle and linden blossom that make BELIEVE stand out from the current tidal wave of `sweet shop' fragrances that have been cropping up with alarming frequency. The middle notes lend a `grown up' feel as the sweetness in the scent calms down.The base notes of patchouli amber and pink pralines lend comforting warmth minus the sugar rush I was expecting.While BELIEVE may just be the latest in a long line of sweet fruity/floral it knows where to draw the line between pleasantly `come closer' sweet and `child's first perfume' syrupy sensory overload. BELIEVE is Britney's most wearable fragrance that grown women can easily wear without embarrassment. Britney grows up,Neutral
The perfume got in time and in perfect conditions. I love all Britney's perfumes  but this is my favorite one. This is the second time that I got &#;Believe&#;. I love the sweet smell perfect for summer!! Everything is perfect!!,Neutral
This perfume smells soooo sooo GOOD!!! I purchased this for $. at a local tj maxx retail store and I'm glad I did. If you like the preppy sweet fresh clean smells you will love this! I sprayed only a little and it lasted all day long! I can already tell I'm going to have a great relationship with this perfume!! Smells AMAZING!!,Neutral
This smells wonderful and it has pretty package!  I like this a lot and it's not just a young woman's scent.  When I wear this I always get compliments on how good I smell and it lasts and doesn't fade away like other perfumes. Smells wonderful!,Neutral
I purchased this with a pack of other Britney Spears perfumes at Kohl's on Black Friday a few years ago. I have to say this was by far the worst perfume of the four I purchased. It reminded me of going to the mall and passing through various perfume sections; it just smells like a stock old lady perfume. Her other perfumes are at least unique; this one screams generic. If you're seeking out this particular one you're wasting your time. I'm sure you can find a ton just like it at JC Penny or Macy's. Old Lady Smell,Neutral
This is a must have for every woman. It is not to over bearing yet it lasts all day. It is on the sweeter side but I do wear it at night as well. Even after a shower the smell lingers. Perfumes are expensive so my criteria is a lasting smell. Can't beat this one. Perfect,Neutral
Perfect perfume for those who like this fragrance. It arrived on time completely sealed and the fragrance was true. (I say that because some people complain about receiving what they believe are knockoffs--this was the real deal) Great perfume.,Neutral
I used this perfume for a few days and I'm not sure what to think.  This review is for the current product (as of April  when I started using it); I am not familiar with the old version mentioned in some of the other reviews.  Two things are definitely in this product's favor:() It lasts longer than any other eau de toilette from any other brand I've tried lately (I'm trying to find a new perfume for myself).  This one actually lasted through a whole work day for me.() The scent is actually more powerful when you're perspiring a little bit (was pretty strong when I exercised at the end of the day).  This should be good for the hot summer days that are coming up.And now here's what's giving me pause.  This seems to respond a great deal to body chemistry.  It actually smelled different on me yesterday than it did today.  Yesterday it reminded me a little bit of men's cologne.  Today it's a wonderful scent that's more reminiscent of the product description (orange patchouli etc.).  I've never used a fragrance that changed like that before and it's giving me pause about buying a larger bottle.I really do like the long-lasting aspect of this and I'm going to keep using it for awhile on the off chance that the second day was just an anomaly.  If it is possible for you to get a sample before committing to buying a full-sized bottle use it for a few days and see how it responds to your own body chemistry. lasts a long time but scent seems to change based on body chemistry,little bit
Advisor to buyers: When researching these acidic peels look for &#;buffered&#; and &#;unbuffered&#;. Unbuffered is % pure and not diluted with water; buffered is diluted. Physicians use buffered.I purchased the % unbuffered about  months ago because I wanted quicker results. I have terribly dry skin on my hands and arms. My skin is so dry that it took  applications of % strength for a real peeling effect to begin. Even after the initial peel you will continue to get small flakes later on. A bonus is that it removes age spots (I'm ). To keep the spots from returing use sun screen on your hands and use a peel once every month or so. I also use the % unbuffered on my face. This stings so I don't use the % at all! Also don't use perfumed lotions on skin you are peeling because it will sting burn and itch.I consider myself an &#;expert&#; because I had professional chemical peels for years in my -'s (paid $ per visit) so I was confident I could do this myself. And I did! % and % Glycolic Acid Peel,dry skin
I use Retin-A and that leaves me with flaking skin and this product is very good for helping to lightly polish off those flakes.I also use it (gently) when I am in the final flaking stages of a chemical peel.I like it because it's 'neutral'. No perfumes or additives and the grit is very fine. Your skin is going to be sensitive if it's sloughing and I think its best to use something simple and with nothing added (unlike commercial 'scrubs' you can get at the drug or dept stores).I use it with a buf-puf and use a gentle but fast circular motion keeping the puff on the surface and not pressing in really hard. You could also use it with one of those cleansing devices with a spinning head.You will need to rinse a LOT the grit wants to stay behind. Finish with a spray of mineral water and then leave your skin alone for awhile ( minutes minimum) to let it settle down before applying products. An effective exfoliater removes flakes without inflaming great for use with Retin ,Neutral
This product is a great conditioner but a true protein! The smell is a HEAVY perfume smell so please be aware. I love for my hair to smell like my conditioners so I'm okay with it. Make sure to rinse well and if you have an issue with protein and moisture balance only use this once a month. If combined with the leave-in and other products containing protein you might end up with an overload. I know first hand. I will re-buy but it'll take me a while as I'll only use this once a month. GOOD STUFF!,Neutral
I really like this product and plan to continue using it. The ingredients are great and I love the fact that it has added CoQ rosehip flaxseed oil and calendula. For half a year I had to use less expensive skin care products and cut down on the items I used due to financial cutbacks. This eventually took a toll on my -year-old skin causing it to become drier and with larger pores saggier and wrinkles to form. After trying countless other creams within the same price range including Burt's Bees I decided to try this and those problems are slowly but surely fading after several months of use. That's without the use of my usual serums/oils and other products that have worked so well. I also have really enjoyed using products that have fewer chemicals and more beneficial natural ingredients as it seems to be improving my skin long-term--though it did take some getting used to.Is it an all-in-one miracle cream? Not really or at least not by itself and not with immediate results but the fact that it has good ingredients is inexpensive lasts a long time and does its job has me continuing to use it. I also enjoy the fact that I feel like I'm not only keeping my skin moisturized but also nourished and with fewer chemicals involved (it is not all-natural unfortunately but bears a low level of toxicity). I do believe in switching products up in order to benefit from other ingredients but this is the one I turn to the most.This is a really thick moisturizing cream but it's not sticky it absorbs well into the skin and you don't need a lot which means it'll last a while. I just dab a few small dots along my forehead cheeks chin and nose. It's made my skin much more supple and less saggy pores are smaller and any forming lines are less noticeable and continue to improve. The paperiness that tends to form around my eyes (no wrinkles yet) is more supple as well which is something I've always struggled with. It does however have a tendency to make my combination-dry skin oily at night and by the time I wake up in the morning but it's not horrible and usually depends on the weather. If I feel that might happen I'll switch it up with Mychelle Grapefruit cream or the Maximum Moisture Cream by BWC.Although I am sensitive to smells and perfumes the light fragrance isn't hard to handle unlike the Maximum Moisturizing Cream that has a heavy floral scent (I like that cream and use it occasionally it's just overly scented and a little heavier). Whatever scent is there eventually fades in a few minutes and it's not half as smelly as Burt's or similar lacking that herbaceous smell some products have--it smells more citrus mixed with a hint of floral to me. It also hasn't caused problems with acne short of the hormonal issues I get once a month. During those times I use the Mychelle Grapefruit Cream which works great for that and may top it off with this cream once the other product sets in. I also try to wear sunscreen over this moisturizer when I go outside for prolonged period of time generally due to the vitamin C.I definitely recommend it to those who like products that are more natural nourishing and that won't break the bank especially if they have mature dry or combination-dry skin. Even though I plan to repurchase some of the serums I used before just for added benefit I will continue to use this as my staple moisturizer. I also plan to get the body lotion version since this has worked so well on my face and eventually plan to use collagen and CoQ supplements.If you're brand new to using mostly-natural items (like Burts and BWC) but rather are used to lotions like Oil of Olay you may be in for a bit of a shock due to the thickness and it can take some getting used to. With products like this you don't need a lot--too much and you will go into grease bomb mode. Start off with a very very small amount and add more later if you need it. I do a dot on each quadrant. I also love their leave-in conditioner for my Hermione Granger type hair though that does have kind of an herbaceous smell that fades. :)The full current ingredients are: Purified Water Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (organic) Glycerin Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate Polysorbate  Cetearyl Alcohol Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (organic) Stearic Acid Glyceryl Monolaurate Ethyl Hexyl Palmitate Linum Usitatissimum Oil (Flax seed) (organic) Rosa Canina (Rose Hip) Oil (organic) Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Extract (organic) Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Extract (organic) Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract (organic) Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter (organic) Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil (organic) Citrus Aurantium (Sweet Orange) Oil (organic) Cananga Odorata (Ylang Ylang) Flower Essential Oil Lavandula Hybrida (Lavandin) Oil (organic) Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Oil (organic) Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Prunus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil Calophyllum Inophyllum (tamanu) Oil Squalane (Vegetable source) Coenzyme Q Tocopherols Panthenol Tocopherol Acetate Hydrolyzed Soy Protein Soy Lecithin Allantoin Glyceryl Stearate Dimethicone Phenoxyethanol ethyl hexyl glycerin Benzyl Alcohol Good Cream,long time
I have my own bed at home and I tan daily even though I'm Irish with light skin and natural red hair.  A lot of lotions won't work for me at all and I have had my share of duds.  I bought this one mainly because I love the name and wanted to try something new.  I was really impressed with it.  It IS A TINGLE and a high one at that so if you aren't used to tingle lotions - don't order it yet.  Built up before you do.  If you are used to tingles this one is beyond great.  It doesn't have that burn tingle like some of the other higher tingle lotions do and it offers you a really sexy color afterward.  To top it off it smells SO awesome like candy.  I've had people ask what perfume I'm wearing and my husband loves the smell of it.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone that loves tingle lotions and wants a really sexy look and feel after tanning.It didn't take me long with no base tan this spring to have a really nice sexy all-over tan with this lotion.  It does not feel oily or greasy afterward either and you don't smell burnt when you're done.  Bombshell is worth the money - just make sure that you like tingle lotions or you'll hate it. Awesome smell awesome color awesome lotion,Neutral
I really wanted to love this product for what it promises -- sun protection even coverage lightening spots and so on. And it feels good on my skin. It's not heavy or greasy and absorbs well. And the price isn't bad either. But after two days I returned it. Day one I noticed it had a strong perfumey smell but hoped I'd get used to it. Instead I could smell it all day and I felt like my tongue had gone all powdery (I am sensitive to some highly fragranced products). Day two I'd hoped I'd adapt but it was the same thing -- distracting smell and gulping water like crazy with no relief. So I returned it at the drug store where I'd purchased it. I'm disappointed because I really was looking forward to lightening some sun spots and evening out some discolorations but the smell is too strong. Garnier please cut back on the fragrances! I love your products -- especially your hair styling products -- and those have a strong scent too but on the face it's too much! OK product but it's too strongly scented,Neutral
I've always been able to wear light/medium in tinted moisturizers and foundations in the past.  In this item the light/medium was way too dark so I had to return it.  The fair/light is perfect for me.This is more like a tinted moisturizer than a foundation.  There is little to no coverage for age spots.  I have one age spot on my cheek that is fairly large and the Olay Definity Foam-In Moisturizer has worked great for lightening it but it's still showing up slightly.Olay Definity Deep Penetrating Foaming UV Moisturizer SPF  Fragrance Free . oz ( g)I was hoping this Color Recapture would cover it completely but it doesn't.  The Color Recapture does help with some slight redness I have due to an overly zealous microdermabrasion I did to myself  years ago.I am using this Color Recapture mainly for the glow it gives me (I have dry aging skin that has lost that youthful glow). It makes your complexion look dewy.  I don't care for foundations they feel way too heavy every one I've tried so this product makes a nice substitution for wearing foundation.  Plus the SPF  is good too especially during the winter.  In the summer I use a higher SPF.  I wish this had a higher SPF then it would be almost perfect.Even though the package says it is fragrance-free I detect a very slight chemical fragrance.  It eventually dissipates so I can tolerate it.  Not really a perfumey smell but chemical.My only other complaint about this product is it leaves my face feeling sticky until it completely dries (about  minutes).I have fairly sensitive skin but I have had no issues with burning or redness like others rating this product have had. If you are fair to medium choose this shade,sensitive skin
Love this lotion! It's moisturizing without being heavy and the shimmer adds a subtle glow. The scent is nice and clean smelling and doesn't clash with my perfume too Smooth glow,Neutral
It is very moisturising but also VERY fragrant. Like perfume others will notice that you are wearing it. It's not bad smelling just somewhat overbearing. So I only use this before I go to bed Like perfume,Neutral
I love this daytime face-cream but the fragrance is so powerful it crushes any perfume you'd want to wear - otherwise works well!  : ) Wonderful - but . . .,Neutral
This rich and highly aromatic cream is great to slather on your hands...arms...legs...feet! Anywhere that feels really dry and in need of some massive pampering. With a mixture of fig and vanilla extracts soy oil and shea butter as well as aloe your skin will soak it all up and the lizard look will be history.The aroma is strong and unique and providing you're not planning on wearing perfume to fight it very pleasant. The stumpy dark bronze container makes easy to squeeze out a nice easy stream of the luscious cream too even when you get down to the end of it. I love this Upper Canada Whipped Hand Repair Balm! And for a lot more than my hands. Got Lizard Skin?,Neutral
Winter is coming again and while I dislike that I do like my drying out skin re-moisturized by this creamy lotion. Who better to know about hydrating winter skin than the Canadians ay? A little dab goes a long way in smoothing yours hands without feeling greasy at all. It absorbs without leaving a residue and I like to use it on my dried out feet as well.The scent is light and fresh without being repulsively heavy. You won't smell like either an old lady or a perfume factory. Several of my male friends thought it smelled nicely coconuttie I guess that's the fig. All around it was a real winner. Sweet Moisture!,long way
I love vanilla skin products and especially like this product because it is paraben-free (parabens have a connection to cancer). The US still allows these preservatives to be added to cosmetics. I am glad to see manufactures are removing these awful ingredients hidden in the products we put IN and ON our bodies. Now if the US would only ban these products as they do in the UK!!!This has a light fragrance and feels lovely on my skin. I tend to have dry skin and it makes me feel moisturized without a heavy feeling. It's a hand cream but I like it all over and especially good on my feet before bedtime. Although the fragrance is light it is a perfume scent and not the real scent of vanilla.They list their product as NATURAL which is a bit misleading because most products/lotions are natural. I'd like to see ORGANIC instead since natural can contain pesticides. Light and Wonderful. Not just for hands!,dry skin
My wife wouldn't touch the stuff--she has her favorite FANCL from Japan.So I tried it instead being a regular user of creams and lotions particularly for sports--but also for just plain healthy skin (my favorite being Aveno).  I tried this particular product on both my hands and feet.Very good stuff for those of us who use our hands a lot--immediate gratification--but the scent is horrendously strong.I thought the strength of the scent would subside after five minutes then a half hour then an hour and then finally it bothered me so much that I had to wash it off--never to be tried again.It's not a bad or pungent scent but at this level of strength it seems rank.BOTTOM LINE: This is an excellent lotion for repair of the skin on even the most tortured hands and feet especially if you really punish them with use or weather.  Better than Bag Balm for sure.And if you want to simultaneously repel humans and attract bears it's great for that too.  It smells like one of the better quality brothels one might visit or the Abercrombie and Fitch on Water Street in Downtown Manhattan--which reeks of perfume.This would be a great product in an unscented variety.  Heck remove the scent and I'll buy it. Great cream for those who suffer from Anosmi,great product
This shampoo has all natural ingredients and lathers nicely for a sulfate-free shampoo.  The fragrance is very clean smelling without being too perfumey.  I have been using this for a few months and I have noticed my hair loss has slowed down. It is well worth the price because a little product goes a long way and - pumps is usually enough to create enough lather for chin length hair.  The pump does not work very well but that does not affect the quality of the shampoo.  I will definitely buy this shampoo again. Gentle shampoo chemical free & smells great!,long way
For Audrey is the first and only China Glaze nail polish I have bought and tried. I'm pleased with this nail polish color. Tiffany and Co. have the most appealing beautiful and charming jewelry pieces. Right now they have the cutest charms - cupcake lollipop ice cream etc. and the nicest rings including the Tiffany Moderne ring Tiffany Hearts ring in sterling silver and k rose gold and a ring made of Tiffany Blue enamel. Right now I'm watching my budget and I consider Tiffany and Co. jewelry a luxury but yes a lot of women dream of owning Tiffany and Co. jewelry pieces. I love the scene when Meg Ryan and Bill Pullman are visiting New York's Tiffany and Co. store in the movie Sleepless in Seattle. I love the close-up of Meg Ryan opening the blue Tiffany jewelry box. In my entire lifetime I have personally bought and owned two pieces from Tiffany and Co. I also have bought and tried two of their perfumes. For a woman it is a really special experience to open a blue Tiffany box. In my opinion each hardworking woman deserves at least once in her lifetime to absorb the Tiffany and Co. experience. Anyways this is a pretty nail polish and a very unique nail color. I highly recommend applying the trio of OPI blue Shatters: Navy Blue and Turquoise on this nail polish. OPI's trio of blue Shatters really look nice on this For Audrey nail polish. Overall I'm pleased with this China Glaze nail polish and I will try other nail shades from them in the future when I have the chance. Nice Nail Polish,Neutral
This is the SINGLE best purchase I have ever made in my life. Smells decadent but doesn't hang in your hair... the smell eventually fades when it dries so it isn't overwhelming. Even my mother who is allergic to most smelly lotions hair products and perfumes loooooves this oil. The oil pours out about the consistency of war m honey and soaks right into your hair without leaving it feeling greasy at all. I've been using it for about  weeks now and the ONLY downside I can see to this product is that my hair doesn't hold a curl as well as it used to before I used the product but if I strip my hair I'm sure it will still curl... it's just made my hair just too damn healthy! Best hair product purchase ever.,Neutral
I have fairly dry skin in the winter and slightly oily skin in the summer. I bought this because of the reviews here and elsewhere hoping to find something very moisturizing to prevent flaking that was less expensive than department store creams. Well it does not hydrate that well. My skin still flakes up just as it does without moisturizer. It also has a tendency to sting a little bit as soon as you put it on but this goes away quickly. I am also not crazy about the smell the perfume is a bit strong. On the other hand in the summer it does fairly well and does not make my skin more oily. I have not had a problem with breakouts (as this is occasionally a problem for me with some creams). I don't think I would buy this again. Just OK,little bit
I came across Pure Grace by accident.  I had tried Amazing Grace and didn't really like it (it later grew on me).  Then I tried Baby Grace and I liked that.  So when I saw the set of three together in one box I thought I'd buy it and send the Baby Grace (which I already had) to my friend.  It turned out that Pure Grace was the best one of the bunch!  It smells so clean that you could spill the whole bottle on you and no one would even find it offensive.  They tout Amazing Grace as being such a clean fragrance but it still smells perfumey to me.  Pure Grace is like a really good-smelling soap.  You just have to smell it to believe it!  BUT it is really too weak.  It doesn't last nearly long enough.  I'm hoping they come out with the fragrance oil like they did with Amazing Grace because that's more powerful. Just about the best thing you'll ever smell!,Neutral
I have long natural corkscrew locks and made the mistake to bleach my dark hair blonde. Unfortunately my hair dried out feels like straw and the locks are gone. I've tried many different conditioners in the past naturals and many of them have been making my hair smooth but didn't bring my corkscrew locks back. Finally found Aubrey Organics GPB and my corkscrews are back after only one use better than ever before. My hair feels so soft and smells so incredibly good I can't say enough good things about this conditioner. If you have really frizzy hair through coloring that conditioner is for you. It doesn't smell like perfume but fresh and natural. And I still smell it very strongly after a whole day being outside and sweating. Great product; I am a permanent customer for this one now. Also it is the only one that I found so far that is completely paraben free. Best conditioner I've ever had,great product
I won a free sample bottle of this  years ago and ever since then I cannot live without it!  Both my husband and I have long hair with mine nearly to my waist. Even though we don't use heat to style our hair the normal damage from brushing & combing adds up. When you have long hair even with proper brushes and combs you tend to stretch the hair as you comb it out wet and further stretch when you brush during styling. The result is split ends fragile hair and the need for frequent trims.  We have found that applying the Super Skinny Serum to towel dried hair and then letting it sit for  to  minutes makes comb-outs much easier and less damaging if you use a proper wide-tooth comb. You can also use on dry hair to eliminate frizzies on a humid day- put a dime sized amount in your palms rub your hands together and then lightly touch your hair from the ends up to the roots running your fingers through the hair as we go. Then lightly brush your hair and pat the top side from the part to the ends with what little remains on your hair.The only way you can go wrong with this product is to over-apply it. A little goes a very long way when your hair is dry. When wet you can get away with using more. The product is easy to use but very slippery. You will have to towel off your hands after using it or wash them. The fragrance is fruity and pleasant but light enough not to clash with your cologne or perfume. I prefer to use this on damp hair in place of a leave-in conditioner. Once hair is dry I useKenra Platinum Silkening Mist . oz.instead of another round of of serum. The silkening mist is lighter tames flyaways better and does not look greasy. If you have had problems with greasy hair using the Super-Skinny Serum try using my method: Super-skinny serum on damp hair Kenra Silkening mist on dry hair. When you combine the two products you get a nice layered control of frizz. I then further treat my hair once a week or once every two weeks with a hot oil treatment. Using all three of these products together can go a long ways towards ridding you of split ends frizzies and breakage. if you really still have problems with frizzies on your part line use a tiny dab of hair wax or dread loc wax very lightly on your finger tips and then pat super gently in the sides of your part - that will lock down the short stick-ups without weighing down the rest of your hair. If you resort to layering on a humectant you'll have heavy greasy hair. Carol's Daughter makes some nice hair waxes for that purpose and no you don't have to be African-American to need hair wax on your parts!One added caution - The Super Skinny Serum will coat your hair. That's how it makes comb-thru so much easier. If you don't wash your hair everyday or every other day the build-up of product on your hair can start to look dull and greasy. If you only wash a couple or a few times a week consider using a clarifying shampoo or one that is specifically forumalted to address styling product build-up on the hair. ANother added problem is that the serum seems attract dust and air pollution particles. My husband washes his hair every day but doesn't shampoo but every other day. He likes to rinse out any of the dust that using a serum like this can attract. At least use a clarifying shampoo once a week to get rid of the excess product and you'll be golden! Best serum there is for dry brittle or damaged hair - layer it with other products to reduce frizz and split ends,long way
*****This almond and hemp soap from Dr. Bronner's is amazing! It has none of the harmful ingredients found in many commercial soaps like sodium laryl sulfate etc. It's pure and smells absolutely fabulous. The scent is very natural and authentic too not perfume-like. One thing you should be aware of is that it doesn't foam up a lot because it has no chemical foaming agents; this however is fine by me. I just use a little bit more or clean up without the foam.I like that it has natural oils in it as well so that it's not drying. I use it solely as a bath soap but apparently all of the Dr. Bronner's Soaps can be used for everything from body care to household cleaning. I love this soap and find it gentle enough to even use on my face yet it does clean thoroughly. I love how it makes shaving my legs easy as well because of the oils.It leaves little to no residue. I have read that it can be used to brush your teeth do the dishes and bathe your pets! The only thing I have found that it doesn't work too well for is as a shampoo but I have color-treated hair and it seems to leave it dry. If you have natural healthy hair you can probably use it for shampoo as well.I am hooked and plan to use Dr. Bronner's exclusively from now on as a mainstay in my home. I've been looking for a natural and versatile product like this for years.Highly recommended.*****UPDATE: Also see the comments for some really helpful tips! Pretty Amazing Natural Soap,little bit
This is a nice smell but the perfume is extremely impermanent. It is very subtle and evaporates in seconds. Too bad because I got two of these and I now can't return them. Not sure what I am gonna do with it. Bummer. Smells nice but...,Neutral
This moisture wrap lotion is the only lotion I use anymore. My doctor recommended it due to sensitive skin which reacts to lotions with heavy perfumes and additives. I've tried other lotions but always come back to this. Anymore I pretty much stick with all Neutogena products.Love the very soft clean scent but more importantly is does a superb job at moisturizing and making my skin so very soft.  I live in a very dry climate and this works like a charm.This lotion goes on silky smooth is super moisturizing and is not at all greasy. It is worth every penny to me! My Dr Recommended,sensitive skin
This hand cream works pretty well.  Nothing amazing though in my humble opinion.  Definitely not worth having stinky perfumed hands!!Some people might not be turned off by the smell but I am extremely sensitive to smells and could not stand having this on my hands. Too &#;Perfumey&#; for me,Neutral
I bought this one along with CKB for hubby for Christmas this year. This is a very unusual and delicate smell. It is so refreshing I truly love it. I sometimes wear his aftershave if I have ran out of my own perfume and I love wearing this one. Happy to give this  stars. It would be  if it was cheaper but you get what you pay for. Love this smell,Neutral
I briefly dated a man who wore this as his signature scent. After one whiff I've never been able to forget how amazing it smells -- I still pass men wearing this and want to jump their bones. The hype is right men. Women love this scent. This is a scent that will get you laid.It's so good in fact that I've bought a bottle for my boyfriend and insisted he wear it. It really does seem to be a universally flattering scent and at about $ for .oz it's a better deal than most of the perfumes I buy for myself. Unforgettable.,Neutral
I remember receiving this cologne spray as a gift for either my birthday or Christmas while I was still attending elementary school. I remember liking it a lot at the time...... Now that I am an adult and my tastes have changed I am wearing more mature fragrances. I wouldn't wear this fragrance now but have fond memories of wearing it as a girl.This fragrance is perfect for a young girl between the ages of - who wants to wear perfume.... A great starter perfume if you will. The Nostalgic Factor...,Neutral
When you first spray on some of this perfume it almost has a floral fragrance. But give it a few minutes and it turns warm and powdery. You can't help but feel cozy when wearing this fragrance. You can spray it all over to make your skin smell like fresh soap. This is one of the perfumes my husband doesn't complain about when I wear it. He thinks everything else I use is too strong. So this might be a good option if you usually get headaches from other perfumes.~The Rebecca Review Inexpensive perfume with a soft powdery fragrance,Neutral
I have been on the lookout for something that smells light and clean and fresh and not like perfume. This is not a winner. It does smell lemony and wonderful immediately upon applying and then is gone almost as immediately. Then it starts smelling very floral and not a good floral (at least not on me). The only good part about that is that it doesn't last either. I ish I had the experience some other reviewers did. Oh well. I suggest you pass on this. Nice lemon scent- for about  seconds,Neutral
I've always liked Pacifica's candles so I tried this scent first as a sample then bought some.If you like 'foody' type scents like vanilla you will probably enjoy this. It 'whispers' to you doesn't scream the kind where people need to be pretty close to smell it. It does not smell overly like suntan lotion either which sometimes coconut can be connoted with.I always like perfume in this solid form to me it has more subtlety than liquid based versions.I have layered it with sandalwood and amber and that created an interesting scent. It would probably work well with a citrus scent too. Subtle yummy scent nice for layering,Neutral
I love Pacifica's solid perfumes. They're easy to carry in my purse and reasonably priced so I can change things up whenever I want. I don't know what a Tibetan Mountain Temple actually smells like but this smells like gingerbread with a touch of patchouli. It's a nice earthy scent but just not for me. Smells like gingerbread,Neutral
I collect several rose and rose blend perfume. Pacifica is a proprietary blend that does smell &#;rose&#; enough.  My friends would answer rose if I ask them what perfume I'm wearing.If you put Pacifica side by side comparison with pure rose one you would notice a difference. When it's own no one can tell. So if you love and use rose perfume a lot like me very cost efficient.Therefore the price of this tin can version is very very reasonable. Check out at Whole Foods it's priced at . (in NYC).When you wear this right after the shower (I do front and back of neck area) first note (it's not like a real layered perfume though) lasts for a couple of hours.  It will faint over the time but it lasted a slight scent about  hours.If you want to keep it smell some strength you may keep adding like every couple of hours.Like every other reviewers it is convenient to carry around.Overall great buy for the quality and lasting performance!FYI a solid perfume is in general to last longer than a spray version. Not a pure rose perfume but rosey enough makes a good buy,Neutral
The Island Vanilla scent is fan-freaking-tastic but solid perfume sucks in general in my opinion. It just doesn't transfer to my skin very well and what little fragrance there is dissipates almost instantly. If you like this scent but the regular perfume instead. Smells great but doesn't work,Neutral
I use this as a base for perfume on my pulse points. It gives my perfume a little oomph. Good light sweet/smoky smell. Nice light smell.,Neutral
I love Pacifica solid perfumes! Currently on their website they sell approximately  solid perfumes. I have Tahitian Gardenia Mexican Cocoa Hawaiian Ruby Guava Malibu Lemon Tuscan Blood Orange Waikiki Pikake Thai Lemongrass Tibetan Mountain Temple and Lotus Garden. My favorites are: Waikiki Pikake Thai Lemongrass Tibetan Mountain Temple and Lotus Garden. I was first introduced to Pacifica solid perfumes when I looked at their display at a Whole Foods store in early . Ever since I bought my first Pacifica solid perfume I've become their fan! I love the solid perfume concept because you can put these solid perfumes in your purse or in your desk drawer - they're so portable! Last year I gave these Pacifica solid perfumes as part of gifts to my friends and co-workers. They make great Christmas stocking stuffers! I also love the fact that the fragrances are light and not overpowering or overwhelming. I'm not a fan of heavy fragrances. I also love the fact that I have control in terms of how much fragrance I put on my body. Sometimes when you use perfume sprays you can accidentally spray too much. I also don't have to worry about broken glass perfume bottles and flammable perfume sprays. With solid perfumes all I have to do is apply whatever amount I want on my wrists. And yes the Pacifica fragrance does wear off during the day but I can reapply again since I'm carrying the solid perfume in my purse. When it comes to fragrance it's better to wear less than to wear too much! I also love that the Pacifica company is cruelty-free and % vegan - no animal testing. Pacifica uses % natural coconut and soy wax in their products. I love that I can try a variety of scents at such an affordable price. Pacifica's solid perfume line makes life easier for women! I Love Pacifica Solid Perfumes!,Neutral
Pacifica's Tahitian gardenia is not your typical boring floral scent.It's fresh and green without being stuffy or old lady. I've never triedany other gardenia perfumes so can't compare but ... I used to likeDavidoff's Cool Water and Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanilla before becomingmore health conscious. Those scents are more sophisticated than Pacifica's... but I refuse to knowingly expose myself to chemicals now. Took off  starbecause it lasts a maximum of  minutes. Since it contains no toxic parabensor pthalates ... there's nothing to preserve the gardenia scent. You couldtry adding essential oil to the base to boost fragrance strength. lovely vintage gardenia -- I feel like a s movie star,Neutral
i really like this perfume fragrance.  but i have to say that calling it mexican cocoa is probably misleading.  i think the nutmeg is a little stronger than i would have expected.  like the other reviewer it seems to have more of a cola fragrance.  all that being said i still love it and will wear it on a regular basis.  i don't like flowery or overpowering perfumes so this suits me perfectly.  sweet and subtle. good fragrance...but....,Neutral
I am a veteran of hair dye remorse and i always dye it then change my mind well this time it was black and i went back to blonde and I got to the point of a very light tangerine color but i already bleached it  times and my scalp threatened to kill me if i did anymore so i quit.. I am right now using shimmer lights as a toner and omg its fantastic and the smell honestly isn't that bad it used to be really strong but I think they toned the perfume down and now i like the smell. My hair was super pourous though so its taking the orange right out.. i just misted my hair with water and lathered in a heaping helping of the shampoo and let it sit.. great shampoo seriously for violet shampoo its the best. YAY shimmer lights,Neutral
I have owned BI for a total of two days now. The first day I wore it I went a little too soft with it in fear that I might over do it. I lurked around on the website's message board and learned that you can actually OD on this and get an opposite reaction of what you really want. So the first day I didn't get much reaction.  However I wore one of the samples that was sent to me and got many many compliments.  (Tarot Empress...a soft clean powdery scent) The second day I got a little more brave with it and covered it with another one of the wonderful samples that was sent. This time I got some awesome reactions. Oh...I should mention that I work with nothing but men. I read that you should really not wear this to work but I did and it was pretty great!!! The men were really helpful with almost everything and seemed more willing to work in a teaming environment with me. They would stop me in the hall and say that my smile was great and that something about me was different. Oh and the guy that I really like lingered in my office for quite a long time. A few times I could see him blush and get speechless. So yeah I think I'm hooked. I will be careful about wearing it around the office....don't want to send the wrong impression. I wish that I could just target one person with it..the guy I like. I will be ordering more from this company. For work I'm going to go with the pheromone based perfumes. I can't wait to get more. Blatantly Amazing!,long time
purchased & haven't noticed very much of a difference beside people commenting i smell nice (this is an unscented blend) - most of the reviews on here are from the rewards program over a love potion perfumerie!the only reason i'm giving them  stars instead of  is because they do offer stellar customer service & plenty of yummy perfume samples with your purchase!i'd probably purchase perfume from them but am not sold on whether pheros really work in general (purchased several from different vendors) placebo?,Neutral
Every girl needs a secret weapon in her arsenal and Blatant Invitation is among a few I have in mine.  I like to apply this Pheromone blend when I'm with my S.O.  It adds a sexy adventurous vibe to our evening and definitely spices up the love life.  The other poster is correct:  You need a scent to cover this.  The label does say Unscented but that means that it is JUST the pheromone in this blend no other perfumes or scents So some of the copulins are detectable to the nose.  This is NO problem as long as you apply a swipe of your favorite Love Potion Scent over the top.  any of your other favorited perfumes should work to cover as well.  If you're in doubt try at home fist.  Blatant Invitation when applied alone may go on your skin  a bit loud but it does dry down after about  minutes. Just don't get it on hair or clothing or the scent will stay on them until you wash your hair/clothes. This is your secret weapon!,Neutral
I'm still relatively new to the whole pheromone market and I often approach those products with caution. Firstly is there any truth to the varied claims? Secondly what's in this? Some phero sellers really push some junk I would not want to put on my skin.If your new to the whole idea I'd say the first step is trying one through a respectable company. For me that place is a small boutique perfumery called Love Potion. I honestly would not have ever tried this type of product if I had not already been drawn to this Perfumery because of their excellent custom fragrances.Blatant Invitation was the third phero I tried at LPMP and wow was I surprised. The phero blend with the added dose of couplins make this a head turner and will attract interest of varied degrees. Only wear this if you are interested in receiving the attention though. I would not wear this to work. But a date night with that someone YES!This is an UnFragranced phero blend but it does have a somewhat strong smell on its own. Definitely allow a short dry-down time before getting dressed and wear a favorite perfume with it. Turns Heads,favorite perfume
I'm in love with this pheromone. It helps me stay calm and happy...and it helps with bonding! I wear this around my family and friends a lot. It also helps with grumpy husbands! I also love that because this is unscented you can wear this with any perfume or even by itself! Happy Phero!,Neutral
I bought this face cleanser as a part of my -Step Japanese Skincare Routine.  Not only do I have super sensitive combination Japanese-American skin but I also live in both dry Colorado and humid Georgia.  I needed something that was gentle yet cleaned my skin thoroughly of makeup and dirt.  Most soaps are too dry for me or the perfumes are overwhelming.  This foaming cleanser is wonderfully unique in that it puffs up like a thick shaving cream.  To achieve this you have to buy an additional: a Japanese foam net.  You put just a tiny (and I mean tiny) pea-size smear on the net trickle on some water then scrub the net between your hands.  It forms a huge blob of thick creamy and dense foam which you then use to clean your face with.  The idea is that your fingers don't rub your face and damage it; the microscopic foam does the deep cleaning for you.PROS:- no scent just smells clean- easy to use and creates foam within seconds- very affordable compared to American brands of face cleaners- a bottle with last you almost  months (if you use the foam net right)- foam rinses away clean without residue- no allergic reaction whatsoever (very very safe for sensitive skin)- doesn't strip essential oils from your face- much improvement on my overall skin tone (make a pale even complexion)- works on American skin not just Japanese! (my skin leans towards the rough Irish genetics)- helps keep oil levels down- safe to use twice a day after makeup at night and before makeup in the morningCONS:- works well in humid weather but in dry weather you must follow up immediately with toner + serums- foam can get a little messy- need to buy the additional tool (the foam net is about $ for a multi-pack)- ingredients are listed in Japanese which I have trouble reading (might need to look it up online)OVERALL:I am a loyal customer for life.  This is such a unique and gentle way of washing your face.  It's so refreshing and cleans without harming your skin.  Rubbing your face with your fingers can cause wrinkles stretch your skin or rub around the oils.  Towels can collect bacteria or be abrasive.  This foam is incredible and costs just as much as American products found in the local stores.  I really enjoy the feeling of the foam on my face even if I look silly doing it!  What a great product! In-Depth review for this awesome product!,great product
I love the bottle!! I like to wear sweet perfumes so this is perfect! I have tried all the perfumes by Paris Hilton and this is the best!! The best perfume ever!,Neutral
I really like the &#;light&#; and sweet smell of this perfume.  Not an over the top scent but &#;fun&#; and &#;youthful&#;. Fresh and Soft,Neutral
I got this in a goody bag for a party I attended.  I love perfume and while I probably would have never thought to even try something by Paris Hilton I was excited to get my hands on a new scent.While I wouldn't say it smells like cheap perfume it lacks the depth and staying power that exists with most higher end fragrances.  It's smells young and sugary and sort of like a heavy cotton candy bath spray. As far as sophistication I would put it in the same category of fragrances as Cool Water Clinique's Happy Curve and other fragrances I loved when I was in high school.  They smelled good and were age appropriate.I think this would make a great gift for teens just getting into perfumes but would seem out of place on anyone over the age of . Good for teens or young women.,Neutral
Its a shame but at first it smell great give it an / hr an your smell its gone. so i'm sorry but I have to give this perfume two stars. great price but smell doesn't last,Neutral
Regardless of the price this is the best perfume I've ever smelled in my life.  I really do like the light but distinctive sweet smell. I can't get enough of it. Best Perfume I've Ever Smelled,Neutral
Very good presentation of this perfume its fragrance denotes quality and presence its good smell love for lovers of good Excellent,Neutral
i am . not trying to be young. love my age. and i like this smell. it softens to a cotton candy smell. goes on somewhat strong though. its a smell for the weekend. if you are trying to be classy this aint the perfume! lol! Dolce and Gabanna The One would be the classier sweet smell. smells like cotton candy,Neutral
While I'm not a Paris Hilton fan and would never actively seek out a product with her name on it I got a sample vial of this perfume and was pleasantly surprised. After wearing it a couple days I was so happy with it that I bought the full sized version. It's a fun warm flirty and girly fragrance that i just feel pretty and fancy wearing. It's not overpowering at all. Just a single spray is perfect for a subtle hint of fragrance. Though i wear it often every time i do my boyfriend comments on how good i smell. I highly recommend. This fragrance will take you by surprise - flirty cute and feminine!,Neutral
This perfume is not bad but I'm not quite fond of it. The smell reminds me of dolls barbies somewhat brings me back to my childhood. It doesn't last very long either (maybe two to three hours). It smells sweet not quite candy sweet as the name would suggest but  more flowery sweet with a hint of candy. Smells like young girls. It's something the  to  years old girls might love. Not quite my type. I've purchase the &#;Curve Chill by Liz Claiborne&#; and I think as another sweet/similar type of perfume it keeps up way better than this one. Not quite my thing,Neutral
It is a perfume normal typical for a good gift do not think it the option to direct from a store with a woman but I'm sure anyone would want to have. It's just a beautiful bottle.,Neutral
this was my first perfume. which is the only reason i have it still because the sent is way too sweet for me now. when i was in middle school it was amazing but now not so much. it smells like fantasy but with floral notes. if your into things like that go for it. candy and flowers,Neutral
This will always be my favorite fragrance. Very concentrated perfume. Even after a full  hour day in the salon people say they can still smell it. I only apply once and that's in the morning all over great deal,Neutral
I love this perfume it smells so good and the scent is long lasting. When u wash ur clothes u still get smell it. I get complements from this fragrance. Buy it and u will love it. OMG,Neutral
I first must comment how beautiful the packaging of this perfume. The box is large and beautifully engraved. Now onto the perfume. The perfume is florally and quite strong when you first spray it. However when you wear it longer it dries down to this beautiful scent that smells like a bouquet of roses. It lasts quite long for an EDT. I only have to reapply the perfume when I go out for the night. Other perfumes that I use/like for reference: Vera Wang Princess D&G Light Blue and Versace Bright Crystal. My signature scent,Neutral
Buen perfume para nosotros aunque lo importante es que el producto si llega a tiempo y huele bien vale la pena esperarlo. Nautica for men,Neutral
i bought this perfume for my husband and i love the smell and the price really recomend it  and he loved it to great smell for low price,Neutral
I didn't notice that it did anything to help or to hurt my curly hair - it's a good spray to spray on after shampoo.  Gives some hold but not too much.  Also has fragrance but all Bed Head products do.  What's good about the fragrances they use in their products is that the ones I tried at least don't last.  So in the shower when your washing your hair and if you use this spray when you're drying it there will be fragrance.  But I don't notice it afterward it doesn't follow me around all day the way some brands do...I'm not a perfume-y fragrance person it aggravates my allergies - but I can use this without a problem. A good blowout spray,Neutral
This is a great spray bottle.  It's the perfect size for traveling.  Great for taking along some of your favorite perfume in a smaller easier to deal with container.  The nozzle doesn't get clogged either. Great Spray Bottle,favorite perfume
... The product leaves your hair soft but some what greasy.  It smells really nice like a Paris Hitlon perfume. mmm I wouldn't call it a miracle... but it's ok,Neutral
I have very sensitive skin and many allergies. I was searching on Amazon for some soap without perfumes or dyes and came across this. I was looking forward to trying it.I get dandruff easily but I have very thick curly out of control hair and I read that this might work for it. I had yet to find a product that could manage both. It did not make my dandruff worse but my hair was so dry and tangled after using this that I didn't use it on my hair again.I decided to use it as hand soap only. I started getting awful rashes and eczema all over the palms and backs of my hands. I'd never had eczema on my hands that bad before. I wasn't sure what was going on. I used it a few more times to make sure that this was the cause. Apparently I'm allergic to this. :( So I had to throw the rest away.It does have a scent. I imagine it's just the natural shikakai scent. It's mildly sweet but also a bit like mud. The scent was unique. I wouldn't say that I seek out to have things in this scent but it wasn't unpleasant either. Had the soap worked for me I would have been fine with the scent and the dark brown color. Allergic to it,Neutral
I have baby fine slightly wavy hair that wants to fly away or go flat. Many hairsprays have water which deflates the souffl&eacute; I create (not a bouffant by any means just normal volume with a bob but with my hair the default is flat and limp. Handling it much makes it go flat so I think of it as a souffl&eacute;) but this just preserves the freshly blown out style all day without looking at all stiff or being sticky. I can reapply if I wish and brushing is very easy-- no damaging ripping noise like with other strong hold sprays and no perceptible build up. My one gripe is that the scent is an acquired taste: sort of an old-fashioned chypre that smells like Parisian lady perfumes. There is an unscented version in regular hold but it is hard to find. I have bought so many cans of this! Nothing else nearly as good!,Neutral
I LOVE this product.  I got a sample of it at Sephora and didn't use it for some time.  I was a bit hesitant to put oil on my often oily skin; it seemed counter-intuitive.  It also seemed a bit expensive.  But after reading reviews of the product online and reading about Argan oil's general skin benefits I gave it a shot and was completely amazed.  I can't live without this product now!You only need a few drops--the product comes with a medicine-dropper applicator--to make your skin soft smooth and radiant.  I put it on every night before I go to bed after washing my face.  When I wake up my skin is more vibrant looks smoother and any redness or spots I might have had diminishes significantly.  And it doesn't really have a scent either which I like; I'm not a fan of perfumed skincare.I don't have acne prone skin anymore in my mid-twenties but I am beginning to get some wrinkles. Somehow this oil seems to fill in those wrinkles around my eyes--I notice this when I apply my makeup in the morning after using the oil.  Amazing!  It's like magic!  I've been using this every night for two months and have only used up a third of the bottle so I can see this lasting + months if used daily.  Definitely give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. my nighttime skincare routine in one step!,argan oil
I received this night cream as a gift along with some Oil of Olay Regenerist products (saved me alot of $$). I immediately took to the Loreal product over  Oil of Olay's to my surprise. I LOVED the scent--very fresh similar to freshly-sliced cucumber--over Olay's flowery-scented creams that remind me of a grandma perfume(yuck).The cream is non-greasy; a combination between an gel and cream texture that creates a transparent thin film when applied. This thin application absorbs fully after a couple minutes without any oily feel.My skin feels moisturized and soft and smells great. I look forward to using this product every day while the oil of Olay Regenerist products are sitting there.For the price here on Amazon I would definitely opt for this Skin Genesis night cream over Olay and will buy it when this bottle runs out. Smooth Greaseless Treatment for Every Night,Neutral
I am absolutely in Love with the Skin Genesis line. After giving up on it after a few days I went back and decided to try this product. I am now proud to say that I am using it religiously every single night and the results are awesome. This moisturizer has the perfect consistency and is not at all greasy or oily in feel. It glides onto your skin beautifully and doesn't dry nor irritate the skin. I wake up to beautiful soft baby like skin. This line beats Olay Regenerist in terms of its effectiveness lesser perfume content and wrinkle busting/skin plumping powers. Great product! Great Skin Smoother and Moisturizer,great product
My hubby says he wishes that there was a real fruit that smells like this! That should give you an idea of how great love spell is. It is sweet tart and refreshing. I feel happy when I wear this to sleep and wake up smelling it on my skin. Pair it with the lotion and the scent will last half a day...and usually fragrances even perfumes have zero staying power on my skin.Pro:Hands down the sweetest yet most refreshing scent of all time! Lasts a long time when worn with lotion or cream. Very wearable and fit for all ocassions. Their other scents are either sickly sweet (the word is saccharin I believe) like Pure Seduction or hecka serious like something your hot rd grade teacher would wear like secret charm.Cons:There is a problem with such a great scent...and it is by no means the product's fault...which is....EVERYONE wears this!!! Seriously I do not know a pretty girl who does not own a bottle of love spell. I get random whiffs of this at the mall at restaurants movie theaters wherever. Then I come home and smell more of it on myself. Granted it is difficult to get sick or annoyed by this fragrance but due to it's immense popularity I believe the product now has less personality. You know what I mean? It is impossible to make a scent yours when everyone and their mom wears it. Of course I cannot take a star away from a product just because it is popular. But if you want something of your own better look for another scent. They actually have lots of great scents for different personalities. Go to the store and try all of it. That was what I did.Another thing...I do not recommend buying Victorias secret body care online. You need to smell it to make sure you love it. A bottle of lotion or spray lasts a long time and you don't want to be stuck with some annoying scent. Also they always always have sales in store. You are likely to get this a lot cheaper. Last time I checked it was  for  bucks.Over all great scent hubby loved it and that's all it matters :)Thanks for reading and hope this helped! My hubby says...,long time
I have straight color treated long hair (almost to my butt)and I HAVE to use conditioner or I will not be able to get a brush or comb through it actually I have to use the thicker conditioners.I decided to try this and it works great- The smell of it is ok- it does smell a lot like perfume but kind of like a perfume - I would prefer it to have a lighter or fresher scent but this is ok at least it doesnt smell bad.But the conditioner over all made it easy to brush my hair and made my hair look healthier and added a fragrance! Works Great!,Neutral
I've been using Monoi oils for as long as I can remember there is something about the scent that is not only so soothing but it makes your skin feel like silk and makes you smell like the sweetest garden in the world.I love how I always get compliments by men and women wherever I go of how good and sweet I smell even if I forget to put some perfume on all day!I have grown accustom to the real traditional pure scent of Monoi flowers that the second I opened this up it made me sick and pretty upset to say the least for the so called &#;Monoi&#; scent.I will not complain about the oil freezing up because I did read it in the description prior to ordering so I was already prepared for that to happen.You must warm it up before every use so the oil can melt which does not really bother me because I always like to slightly warm my oils before massaging them into my skin because it feels so much better but I will say that this specific oil looses its scent even more every time you heat it up.I would have definitely returned it but after warming it up re-smelling it and going to place it on the counter the bottle just tipped over and % just poured out!I've used it several times since them to mix with potpourri or add a few drops in water and it has tipped over twice more which leads me to think that there is something seriously wrong with the design of the bottle since it won't stay straight the second you place down.I would never recommend this or buy it again. Worst so called &#;Monoi&#; oil in the market!!!!,Neutral
This is the best oil ever! The gardenia scent is amazing soft and beautiful. The oil is very warm on the skin. It makes my skin feel like silk. It is great to use after being in the sun very soothing. My husband loves this scent on me. It is better than perfume!!! I LOVE this oil!,Neutral
My mother has been using this soap for years.  She is very sensitive to perfumes and fragrances so this is the only soap she will use on a regular basis due to its mild smell.  She has fairly &#;normal&#; skin - not too oily not too dry and this works well with her skin type.I have sensitive dryness-prone skin and found this just a little bit too harsh/drying.  It also seems to have a tendency to melt in the shower even when there isn't water hitting it directly... a problem I don't usually have with other bar soaps. Good soap,little bit
I like this conditioner because it works really well for my hair type and texture. My hair is really dry and this works very well. the only downfall about this product is the perfume in it is so strong that it literally gives me a headache so I can't leave it on long like I would other conditioners. It is thick and rinse out well without any build up and I like the feeling that it gives my hair. I Like It,Neutral
EO products smell wonderful because of the natural essential oils that don't smell perfume-y. The lavender smells just like a bouquet from Provence.  Furthermore this product is free of harmful irritating chemicals that nearly all bubble baths have Despite this I still get a nice amount of bubbles and I don't have a ring on the tub.  This is the best price available and I use the auto-shipment option for even greater savings. The best bubble bath,Neutral
I've got mixed hair texture.... straight... thin in the front... grows a lil thicker in the middle with baby hair on my neck... but gets frizzy sometimes... i'd been using the same shampoo for over  years until they stopped making it (creme of nature - orginal version)... pissed me off because i'm crazy picky about what i use on my skin and hair... theres usually only one thing or couple that works really good...  thought it would take me a long time to find a natural shampoo with almost the same ingrediants that would leave my hair looking like it used to...  bought this just so i'd have something to wash my hair with until i thought i'd have to go looking for a shampoo that i really wanted.... but this stuff made my hair exactly like i wanted it... didnt have to go looking for anything else... this plus organic wheat germ oil i bought on hereWheat Germ Oil - % Pure and Organic  Ozactually left my hair shinier cleaner and straighter than creme of nature... i just wash it with this shampoo.. leave a lil in my hair like a conditioner and add a lil organic wheat germ oil and my hair looks like salon hair.. crazy shiney... straight ( after using curling iron)... soft and light... leaves my hair cleaner looking than creme of nature.. this shampoo probably makes any texture hair look good but if you have mixed like mine nothing better than this with a lil wheat germ oil rubbed in after (adds even more shine).. smells good too.. just like limes... not like a stinky perfumeMAYBE A LIL DULL (without oil after) BUT NOT DRYI see some people saying it leaves their hair dry...  if that happens just use hair oil or leave in conditioner after.. it'll leave it shiney ... i never used this shampoo without rubbing a lil wheat germ oil on my hair after.. and it did get super shiney after that... shinier...  plus i leave a lil of this in my hair like a leave in conditioner which probably helps it shine... when i got it i thought it might dry my hair out because of the citrus in it but it turned out shiney with the oilTheres nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)... but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it... it might just leave it a lil duller if you dont put a lil oil or leave in conditioner in it after... alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off... like Jasons Naturals shampoo.. i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)... turns out that one has  alcohols in it plus a stinky perufme (perfumes another alcohol).. that will kill your hairWith this stuff all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking... best hair oil to use is wheat germ... olive oil.. jojoba.. almond... grapeseed.. organic aloe vera all left my hair a lil oily looking and greasy.. the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthy CRAZY SHINEY SILKY STRAIGHT AND SOFT - I Have Mixed Type Hair,long time
I have been using this for a few weeks now daily. It does a wonderful job of softening your skin it is a bit greasy feeling at first but that gives it staying power. Some times I use it whole body after a shower it helps hold in moisture. I am not normally one to use stuff that has a smell to it this has a fruit smoothie banana perfume odor but everyone I ask likes it more so the men go figure. I work hard with my hands yard work power tools etc and it has done a great job keeping me smooth and healthy looking. Will see how well it lasts in winter that will be the true test for me so will have to update in the future. I like it.UPDATE // Had wonderful soft hands all winter even with lots of time spent outdoors. Nice smell and softens more then just hands,Neutral
I really wish I knew how much this cream was going to cost because it definitely would weigh into my review of it. I am an RN and of course my hands take a beating with the frequent hand washing that I must do. Sometimes they just burn and feel like they are literally going to crack open. The only creams I buy are Lubriderm and Neutrogena Norwegian Formula. I do not like heavily scented lotions of any kind. The scent is pleasant I would describe it as fresh and clean but it is moderatly strong and it doesn't fade at all. I feel/smell as if I'm wearing perfume which I can not do at my job so this will be a home use product. The cream has all natural ingredients: avocado extract olive oil shea butter soy oil and aloe. Once well rubbed in the cream makes my hands feel silky (the oils are nice) but not at all greasy or waxy. I like the cream but would not spend more than $ per  oz tube. The scent is definitely too strong for me. A product touting itself as natural should not have anywhere near this much scent. I would preferr scent free if it was optional. Really enjoyed trying this.,Neutral
Full of good stuff like olive oil avocado oil shea butter soy oil and aloe -- That's It! ((What's missing? Chemicals like paraben & synthetics bad stuff!))This is a fantastic product!  Rich & emoillent NOT greasy!  The fragrance is fresh clean & slightly floral (not fruity or sweet) -- it could be used as a subtile fragrance or worn with perfume without interfering.  Instantly softened my dry cuticles.  Dry patches disappeared.  My hands felt protected and nourished plus a little of this rich balm goes a long way. WOW,long way
Here in the midwest the real test for a hand cream is its performance with dry chapped hands in the dead of winter.  I write this in early autumn but here's my take so far . . .This stuff smells wonderful - arguably perfect.  I like the natural ingredients approach especially with something I'm trying to rub into my skin (avoiding the hazards of artificial perfumes dyes etc).Goes on with a soothing creamy texture.  My hands are calloused and it did indeed soften them. My only reservation is the residual greasiness.  Not as heavy as some other products but after half an hour it's still there.  And it doesn't seem to be going away.  I'll concede that this may lend itself to the effectiveness of the product as a hand-repair agent.  On the other hand (unavoidable pun) my favorite hand cream is a product that I order from Israel.  It works great but leaves zero greasy residue.This product also leaves a faint lingering scent (with the light greasiness).  The scent is a plus. Generally I like this stuff.  I suspect it works very well on damaged hands with regular application.  I'll keep it close at hand (sorry) as we move into winter. Great scent softens well a bit greasy,Neutral
This is really a wonderful honey citrus scent I just love it.  I have to laugh at the review below where they turn the label around lol because it says 'queen for a day' which might spoil the romance. It is a light non irritating clean scent and has no powerful perfumes and chemicals.  A drop of this also is perfect to use in a sitz bath for those that have 'hems'.  Or if you are camping I could see how a very small amount would be good way to wash kids or pets in one of those tubtrugs. Lovely,Neutral
this item arrived on time plus was so easy to assemble i put it all together in less then hr..its pretty i love it and now i have elegant places to put my perfume and nailpolish i love this so much and im not a little kid...my kids are grown they think it very nice too..thx so much for this strong vanity set..i was gonna go with the wood but the reveiws said the wood vanity is not sturdy at all..but you can rest assure this vanity stand set is. very elegant,Neutral
I really hated this product. I was so disappointed with my results. I read the mostly positive reviews and I was so surprised at the awfulness done to my skin by this stuff. It immediately dried my skin out to the point that my skin started flaking and burning. Also I experienced huge breakouts in places I don't normally get breakouts and in places that I do. The perfume smell is overwhelming and has no place in a moisturizer. This does none of what it promises and exactly the things it says 'it does NOT do.' I threw it away. No Stars - Too Much Perfume and Causes Breakouts,Neutral
I love this stuff. It doesn't seem like it would work as well as it does because it isn't thick and goopy but it really soaks in and keeps your skin soft all day. I'm also sensitive to perfumes and scented lotions but this hardly has a smell at all. Buying from amazon is cheaper than buying from target or walmart. Feel baby soft,Neutral
This product is a great value for the money.  It works as well as some of my favorite more expensive brands like Bliss Fabulous Foaming Face Wash at a much lower price.Because I have sensitive skin that also tends to be acne prone I am very particular about what types of facial cleanser I buy.  This product perfectly fits the bill.  It is oil free and soap free and easily removes my makeup without being harsh and drying.  Best of all it leaves my skin soft and residue free.  It strikes the perfect balance of keeping my skin supple without aggravating it and causing redness or provoking acne.Those who do not like heavily perfumed cleansing products will also appreciate this facial cleanser.  It has a very light and neutral scent that is neither floral or medicinal smelling.  Because of its gender neutral scent my boyfriend has also repeatedly purchased it after trying it at my house.I have also triedAveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser -Ounce Bottles (Pack of ) but prefer this product.  While the Clear Complexion Foaming cleanser is equally gentle and keeps my acne at bay I find that it is less effective in cleaning away make up.Overall I am quite thrilled with this facial cleanser and plan on continuing to purchase it in the future. Perfect for my sensitive and acne-prone skin,sensitive skin
I honestly can't remember how I encountered this product but am glad I did!  I like but do not love the classic Neutrogena RainbathNeutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel-  oz (Mega Size).  My daughter however really likes their classic line (which is probably what brought me here as she is coming home for vacation soon)I will admit to being somewhat of a fanatic for nice bath products (my husband would eliminate the qualifier) and did write up my favorite boutiqueDream Cream Body Cream by LUSHsome - years ago (likely not doing them justice ;)  In any event it is a somewhat dangerous obsession unless one is prepared to spend upwards of $/ day bathing . {sigh}  would that I could.Their skin care line is also very nice but.... well we get into mortgage territory here ;)  All that said this sounded nice so I gave it a try and Wow! much much nicer than I had expected.  In fact it reminds me quite a bit of the cream I linked above :)  If you are not familiar with that line that may not mean anything to you.  The deep cream moisturizer butter cream really is.  It absorbs well and does not feel greasy and leaves my skin feeling very smooth & soft.  It also has a slightly sweet smell like butter cream or creme brulee :)  I use it at night  and find it a very soothing scent which helps me get to sleep.I have allergies and chemical sensitivities so I either go natural/ organic or use a line like Neutrogena developed for people with allergies.  I am glad that I have found one that is reasonably priced safe (for those of us with sensitivities) and which I like so well.  I will be keeping this one on subscription!  I also tried the pink grapefruit line and like that a good  deal too (but personally Prefer this one).I think the grapefruit is better for waking up and this for evening.  (much as I like it I think it would not go well with cologne or perfume and would feel a little odd in a work environment smelling like butter cream.  However as a night cream it is perfect! Great moisturiZer with a very soothing scent.,Neutral
I am allergic to almost all perfumes and dyes.  To top it off I am at that age where I am getting hormone imbalances so I am breaking out like crazy!!  I have been using this for almost a week the little bumps all over my face from allergic reactions are almost gone and my skin has cleared up % already.  I dont see a difference in my fine lines and small wrinkles yet - but then again it hasnt even been a week yet :)  I bought  more kits!! Fantastic for allergy sufferers,Neutral
I got the Neutrogena Make-Up Cleansing Towelettes because I was having a hard time getting my mascara off with the Cetaphil and water that I've always used. The towelettes work as described I can see that all my make-up comes off when I use them including the mascara (though I still have to rub a bit). When I am at home I still wash afterward with Cetaphil and water just to make sure my skin is clean since my pores tend to clog up. At the gym the towelettes are great to get my make-up off quickly before a workout or sauna without hauling around a pile of products. The frangrance is pleasant too not overwhelming or super perfumey. work great,Neutral
It's good but when it comes to convenience theNeutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Sunblock Spf   Oz.is better in my view. We almost stopped using the 'tubes' a couple of years ago when  things happened: most of our kids grew up and we discovered the 'mist' sprays. We never felt like we needed the lotions except for our little baby girl.As far as effectiveness both are good when it comes to being tolerated by the skin and NOT blocking our pores but I do have a preference for the mist myself. They both seem to be water-resistant to some degree. I will not reapply the sunblock after one swim session but mostly out of prudence I will reapply it after the second. We've tested the Neutrogena sunblocks under the Florida sun in June and July for the past several years and no sunburns so far.- UVA/UVB protection- Helioplex for keeping the product effective longer- feels VERY light on the skin- discreet sexy odor- stays effective for several hours- I don't need to re-apply it after swimmingI would recommend this tube to anyone who doesn't like the spray but like I said I like the spray even more._______________________________________True story. I know it's true because it happened to me a few days ago.One lazy Saturday afternoon having completed my  or so laps I am in the back of the house reading a book and sipping some drink Scotch and soda. A bunch of kids are splashing in the pool dogs over-excited. I notice T. circling around trying to look busy a hesitant uncomfortable look on her face. She's my wife's girlfriend a neighbor and she's married too  little girls her  yr. old our  yr. old's best friends. While all this is going on I keep reading enjoying the day sipping my drink.To make it short she seems to find the needed energy to address me directly.A. she says what are you wearing?Svimvear I says (a joke she's from Russia).No no no she says what perfume are you wearing? Or is it your aftershave?What are you talking about? No perfume says I. I just came out of the pool.But A. you smell soooo good says she. My husband never smells like this. Why can't he smell like you do?Ahhhh... I finally realize it's GOT to be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer I'm wearing.True story. Feel free to draw your own conclusions. Perfectly good sunscreen I personally prefer the 'mist' alternative,Neutral
This is a great product.The only reason I am giving it a  out of  is for the fragrance.  I am quite sensitive when it comes to frangrance on and around my face.  It is an almost sour smell similar to a very floral perfume.  When I first apply it to my face my eyes sting and water for a few minutes...So far this sounds terrible but!  The benefit far outways the smell.I have fairly light skin that burns within just a few minutes of being in the sun unprotected.  I spend all summer camping swimming hiking etc.  I apply this to my face/neck/ears once in the morning and don't even have to think about it again until maybe  or pm.  Even after splashing around near the river it holds up better than any sunscreen I've had previously.The finish is nice too. It leaves my face moisturized but matte.  In the summer I use it instead of my regular moisturizer on some days.  It goes well under makeup.I am only sensitive to smells but rarely have skin issues such as redness or breaking out due to products.  The only person I would recommend to NOT buy this is someone who is always having a hard time with regular products irritating their face. Finally!,Neutral
I originally found this at a health food store and loved it.  Found this online for much less $$ and now have this as a staple for my boys ( yrs old).  Nice fragrance smells like pure lavender not perfumey high quality essential oil.  The lotions seeps right in and goes a long way.  Highly recommend. Addicted to this lotion,long way
Not sure how will it will work in the dead of winter; will add a star if I come through March with comfortable skin.The lavender scent is mild and pleasant; does not interfere with perfume. It absorbs quickly does not get sticky or tacky and keeps my skin smooth. The price is good. The product is significantly natural/clean which I prefer. I ended up buying a gallon jug at the company's website which was a good deal. Perfectly good every day lotion,Neutral
nice low cost no funny stuff classic productsometimes you don't want stuff that is too goopy and perfumedThis is just right - nothing overboard. nice low cost no funny stuff classic product,Neutral
I love this lotion and have used many different varieties for many years.  This particular one is truly fragrance-free and does not interfere with cologne or perfume.  It moisturizes without feeling greasy or slippery and is great for hands chapped by cold winter weather.  Highly recommended. Great product!,great product
I've been a fan of Lubriderm for many years but  decided I'd give this a try. Vaseline Intensive Rescue is described as unscented. While it doesn't have a perfumed fragrance it does have a slight petroleum odor not unlike Vaseline Petroleum Jelly. I find the odor unpleasant. The lotion spreads easily and absorbs well into my legs and arms which tend to be drier. It does keep my legs looking smooth and I don't have the flakiness that is normal in winter. On my chest and back I feel stickiness hours after application which I find unpleasant. It's also caused some clogged pores. For me the product will be used on my legs but I'll return to Lubriderm as a general body lotion. Just OK,Neutral
This moisturizer works pretty well. It absorbs fine and is not greasy but don't know that it's really more intensive than regular body lotion. I wanted unscented because I don't like perfumey fragrances but this one has a slightly unpleasant smell to it. pretty good,Neutral
I really love this lotion. My hands can get really dry after a day's worth of washing and due to cold weather. I put this lotion on a couple times during the day and at night and in the morning my hands feel completely smooth. The same goes for my legs. During the winter months my legs can get dry but this lotion smooths them and moisturizes them and I'm a happy girl.Plus it's fragrance free so there isn't any harsh perfume smells that last for hours after you put it on. I'm extremely happy with this lotion. Works really well,Neutral
Vaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion is a great all-purpose lotion product that should work well for many people.This Vaseline lotion is your typical milky white color and is dispensed in a thin stream out of the pump.  The texture is very light and it's easy to apply to your skin as it's absorbed rather quickly (- seconds of gentle application over a large area will get it to absorb).  I have moderately sensitive skin and this stuff didn't cause any blemishes or irritation during daily use for a week in a dry winter environment.  It works well on dry spots above my ankles and the backs of my hands.  You can apply it to your face in a pinch but if you're looking for a face lotion I might go with something just a tad bit lighter.  This Vaseline flavor is touted as fragrance-free as no perfumes are added.  However it still smells like...well lotion...but it's very mild and I'm only taking a half star off because of it.  Some of the Men branded lotions in particular have way too strong of a scent that gives me a headache and makes me look like I'm overly anxious about finding a date.  I'm happy to report that's not the case here with this product.  The other half star is lost due to a somewhat tacky feeling I get between my fingers after I apply a generous amount after a shower.  My legs arms and backs of my hands are not really sticky after being moisturized but for some reason the sides of my fingers stick together more than I'd like.  Not a huge problem but I'll still take another half star off for that.Overall I think this a bottle of lotion that everyone in the family can use due to it's mild scent and effective all-purpose nature. Light feel light scent,sensitive skin
It's really good lotion! My hands get super dry but I can't use anything oily on them because I'm either doing schoolwork or making beads all day. This lotion has a light feel absorbs quickly and doesn't leave an oily finish. I don't feel like I have to apply it frequently to keep my hands super soft and not dry or chapped. I even use it on my face sometimes... and the best part is that it's unscented. As I get older I'm less and less tolerant of perfumes especially on my face. It's just lotion but...,Neutral
I live in the midwest where cold winters mean running the furnace a lot which means dry skin.  My daughter's hands in particular will get so dry they're red chapped and almost raw.  So I was happy to have the opportunity to try this Vaseline Intensive Rescue lotion.On the positive side:It works as advertised and does a good job of keeping my skin soft and moist.  I especially like the feel of it not overly greasy not overly watery and once you work it into your skin it's barely perceptible.On the negative side:The lotion is billed as fragrance free but I'm guessing that means it has no added fragrances because it is definitely not odor free.  It has a slight smell not unpleasant but definitely noticeable. I prefer it actually to other lotions that are heavily perfumed often annoyingly so.  But if it is important to you that your lotion has no smell whatsoever you may want to keep looking.Overall I'm very happy with the lotion and would gladly buy it again. Works well though 'fragrance free' does not mean 'odorless',dry skin
From the first use Fragrance Free Vaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion makes a difference in your skin.  One pump of this effective lotion makes dry skin soft and the softness doesn't wash away wight away.  It takes a couple of hand washings to get rid of the softness that this lotion imparts.  I live in a desert - my skin is always dry but this lotion provides softness right away.  With continued use (a few days for me maybe more or less for you) the overall condition of your skin will improve.  The fact that it's fragrance free means that there are no perfumes to affect sensitive skin.  Neither will it conflict with any fragrance you want to wear so it would be a good choice for overall body moisturizing.  The pump feature is a neat and clean method for dispensing the lotion - no spills from dropping the bottle.  I will definitely buy this lotion for myself and recommend it to everyone I know. A Miraculous Moisturizer!,dry skin
I generally hate lotion. I believe it is primarily for girls. However in the winter when I work with my hands in very cold weather my hands become very rough and dry and I have to do something about it. So I reluctantly used this product. It worked great relieving my rough hands in just a few uses. It seems to combine the soothing of Vaseline Petroleum Jelly with hand lotion. It is very restorative and puts moisture back into the skin quickly. It has no girly smell and is just plain lotion no coloring or perfumes. It really came in handy when I needed it it is a great product for those needing repair to their cracked and rough skin. Skin repair in a bottle,great product
This is a very pleasant update and surprise from Vaseline.  The new formulation absorbs quickly isn't sticky or tacky yet seems to keep a decent amount of moisture in your skin.  It is not the thick type of lotion that Vaseline came out with in the s and s but more reminiscent of the thinner old yellow Vaseline bottled lotions but keeps your skin softer and retains more moisture.  The light scent is also a very pleasant change from the increased use of perfumes in other brands.Overall highly recommended if you're looking for a lightly scented lightweight yet moisturizing lotion.This is my new favourite lotion. Light lightly scented and quick absorbing.,Neutral
Vaseline body lotion is an excellent product and to use on your hands. I have used that this lotion for many years and it usually never lets me down. I was impressed with how well it works with the exception of severely stubborn cracks in my skin. It took daily use for about two weeks to actually begin to see any results. This is not the products fault it is how much water my hands have been in and our severely cold winter. The Al and cucumber aroma was pleasant however it was relatively strong. Him him and you would not want to use this lotion with your perfume.I hope this recommendation will help you and all I ask is that you give it a try and use it very religiously throughout the day. Good stuff,Neutral
Since I've moved to AZ my skin has been severely damaged by the excessive heat we get  months of the year. In addition my daughter's skin is super-sensitive due to  different skin disorders she has had since childhood. 'Vaseline Body Lotion' is very gentle without harsh results to skin with no burning sensation. I noticed that with frequent use of applying to skin especially before sleep it helps dry skin to heal. The Aloe in this product is gentle without a strong perfume fragrance. I will be purchasing this product in the future and we will use frequently especially with the hot weather coming soon. Highly recommended! HELPS TO HEAL VERY DRY SKIN!,dry skin
I work in food service and my hands take some abuse between wearing gloves and being in dishwater so I was excited to try this lotion. I love the clean scent it is not overpoweringly flowery or perfume-y like some more expensive stuff from certain stores. It goes on light not greasy or watery. I keep it in my kitchen so I can put it on as soon as I get home from work and as frequently as needed. It has been a great relief for winterized chapped hands fresh scent and clean-feeling,Neutral
I am a bit particular about my lotions but I've tried a different kind of topical skin care product by Vaseline and it was...okay.This??? I *LOVE*!!!Positives:- I don't find it to have an overpoweringly STRONG scent (though I wore it once and a family member who is OOOOOOBER sensitive to ANY kind of smell [i.e. lotion perfume body ANYTHING] can't stand it....but she is a rare bird and few and far between). Nevertheless I LOVE wearing it and not smelling so strongly of something that other people have to back away because it is so strong. *I've experienced MANY perfumes and colognes that are just overpoweringly STRONG scented and nobody likes to be near them because of that.- Little bit goes a long way but I can still put a thicker layer on and I don't feel slimy or gooey or....like I have just plastered some kind of paste on my arms and legs.- Leaves me feeling - to some extent - hydrated. I feel like I've just remoistened my very dry skin.- I use it mostly on my arms backs of hands and calves sometimes but this can be used almost ANYWHERE. I've used it once or twice on my face *sigh*.....feels good there legs feet and my upper back/shoulder/neck area.- it isn't hard to pump and the pump RARELY  gets clogged. *If you let it all come out - either in your hand or on your skin and don't leave any little bit on the hole of the handle where the lotion actually comes out it's highly improbable that there will be any dried/semi-dried 'ick' that clogs that hole. I haven't had an issue when I've taken the extra  or  seconds to make sure I wiped the rest of the lotion from the bottom of the handle-pump.- I like the viscosity of this. Not too thick but not super thin with a lower than normal thickness. I feel (literally and figuratively) that the thickness is PERFECT.Negatives:- The only negative I can think of is that case with my family member who is OOOOOOBER sensitive to any kind of smell. If you have one of these in your household/come into contact everyday....wouldn't suggest this. Other than the EXTREMELY-sensitive-to-scents individuals I don't really see any negatives to this product. That is potentially the only downside: the scent (which is really rather mild ESPECIALLY in comparison to other lotions from other places like Bath & Body works and Mary Kay.)- Texture: I am perfectly fine with the texture but POTENTIALLY if someone likes a more runny (I think runny lotion is bothersome) kind of topical skin care lotion/cream this would be too thick. However it is NOT gel-like in substance but is not overly creamy-thick yet still maintains a mild viscosity. smooth gentle soft scent,little bit
The Vaseline Total Moisture Body Lotion worked okay. I have very dry skin so I was hoping this lotion would make my skin feel more moisturized and last longer. It has an unusual perfume-type smell to it that did not go away. I prefer for my lotions to be odorless. medium moisturizing product,dry skin
As a consumer of lotions I use to avoid Vaseline products as they always seemed so oily and made my body feel sticky instead of refreshed.  However I took a big leap trying the new version Vaseline Total Moisture Body Lotion Pure Oat Extract and am happy I afforded this product another try.  The lotion is creamy and can be rubbed into the skin so it is restorative.  Not heavily perfumed a clean smell is left after coaxing it on your hands and full body.I am quite fond of this new lotion and will be purchasing it again. NOT OILY,Neutral
This lotion is good at moisturizing and creating a long-lasting moisturized feel. Unfortunately the product uses animal glycerin which leaves an extremely tacky/sticky feel to the skin after application.Also coming from someone who is picky when it comes to lotion scents the scent of this lotion is bothersome after several days use. The old formula did not have such perfume-y undertones and was much better in terms of leftover tacky feeling. -,Neutral
I'm not one of those women who like the perfumed body lotions that so many seem to favor today. I far preferVaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion Fragrance Free .-Ounce Pump (Pack of ) and have used it for decades. Even with periodic formula upgrades that Vaseline product is still my favorite of all lotions.I recently tried the Vaseline Total Moisture Body Lotion in Pure Oat Extract. Although it is not the unscented lotion I prefer the scent is subtle enough that I don't mind it. More importantly it doesn't clash with my perfume.The Pure Oat Extract formula does feel nice for the body and absorbs well but I have to say I don't like it so much on the hands. Compared to Vaseline's Repairing Moisture formula the Pure Oat Extract just doesn't leave my hands feeling quite as soft as I'd like.While the Vaseline Total Moisture Body Lotion Pure Oat Extract formula is a good product it is not the best that Vaseline makes in my opinion. I will continue using my trusty old unscented Vaseline Repairing Moisture lotion after finishing the Pure Oat Extract. Good lotion but not as good as the Vaseline Repairing Moisture formul,Neutral
I had a bad reaction to this lotion so I can't really rate the effectiveness of the product... I had to wash it off right away. I wouldn't normally even review a product I had an allergic reaction to simply because allergies can be unpredictable and there's likely not a real problem with the product itself.That said I feel I can honestly criticize this product because it has a very strong unpleasant smell that doesn't wash off! Wasn't that a rude surprise. I hopped in the shower to get this off my arms and could still smell it on my skin hours later. That's a pretty hefty dose of fragrance! If the product smelled good that level of scent might be acceptable but it doesn't smell good. It reminds me of perfume kept past its expiration date. Meaning this stuff smells like my great grandmother. It surely doesn't smell like oats! I imagine they were trying for an herbal/natural scent but it comes off as overpowering and cloying. Unpleasant smell,Neutral
Working in food service I spend a lot of time in vinyl gloves and a lots of time doing dishes. My hands used to get really dry and crack in the winter but this lotion has been a sweet savior. It goes on without being greasy like other lotions and also without the overpowering perfume-y smell. I highly recommend it to anyone who is tough on their hands and could use some relief and pampering without breaking the bank. my hands crave intensive care,Neutral
This lotion is awesome. I have gotten many compliments from people that thought I had on a body spray or even perfume. It is long lasting goes on smoothly and is great for sensitive skin. Sweet smelling awesome feeling lotion,sensitive skin
Bought this inially for my husband and he didn't like it at all. Rather than waste the product I tried it twice. I am sensitive to all perfumes and don't wear them. Most anything can give me a rash. This product has a distinctly perfumey scent and if you truly have sensitive skin I can't imagine this working for you. The product is too thick to dispense properly and the bottle is much too large to hang onto. Very unhappy with this product. When I went to the Dove website to send my comments the Contact Us button wouldn't work.I am now buying Aveeno Fragrance-Free and happy with that. Fragrance Free? Really?,sensitive skin
This product is comparable to most other brands of peroleum jelly primary fifference is the delicate perfume fragrance;  somewhat expensive. Vaseline Baby Betroleum Jelly,Neutral
I must say I don't really care for this body wash.  It's very thick thicker than some body lotions and it feels just like rubbing lotion all over yourself in the shower.  This body wash doesn't lather well at all and doesn't feel like it rinses off either.  We do have extremely hard water where I live so that might be why it doesn't lather well at all.  I also don't care for the scent - it's very perfumey and sticks around long after you've used the product.  I gave this body wash three stars because it's excellent as shave lotion for my legs.  I live in a very dry climate and my legs are always rough.  Using the product for shaving leaves my legs nice and smooth and doesn't leave me with razor burn.  I don't think I would purchase this product again though even for shaving.  It's just too smelly and hard to pour out of the bottle. More lotion-like than body wash,Neutral
I've long been a fan of Dove Products (for about as long as I've been a sufferer of dry skin).The Dove Go Fresh Body Wash is a stellar product from this line.  It has everything that you might expect from Dove.  It washes off cleanly without leaving any residue on your skin.  It cleans well and moisturizes.  I've used it myself and also on the more delicate and prone to rashes skin of my children.  In addition to being a great soap that moisturizes it has a very pleasing scent that is not at all overpowering or too perfume-y.All in all a great winner! Really Nice Scent,Neutral
I like the idea of a moisturizing body wash with a fresh scent. I do love the scent and color of this. It makes a nice rich lather. It's not as drying as perfumed shower gels. STARS: I loved it. The only reason I didn't give it  stars is because it still isn't quite moisturizing enough for winter. For that I need Olay with body butter ribbons. Dove Nectarine and White Ginger,Neutral
No kidding those will be the first words out of your mouth as soon as you start lathering up with this body wash.Now I should start off by saying that I'm already a fan of Dove products.  I try to use as many natural/organic health and beauty products as I can but living as I do on a limited and fixed income sometimes I just can't afford to buy as many of those products as I'd like.  Out of all the big-name commercial products out there I trust Dove's to contain the least amount of harsh chemicals surfactants detergents or any other potentially offensive ingredients.  And so far that trust hasn't been broken.The first thing I noticed about the Dove Go Fresh Burst Body Wash was its fragrance.  From the moment I started lathering up the scent hit me right in the face.  Not in an obnoxious offensive way but in a My goodness this smells so good it should be illegal! way.  The nectarine and white ginger fragrance is rich and decadent; it perks me up and makes me smile every time I lather up.  It's utterly luscious.  When I step out of the shower the fragrance lingers on my skin again though not in an overpowering way.  In fact it simply adds a subtle layer of scent to any body lotion or spray or perfume I might choose to apply.The lather is the second fabulous thing about the Dove Go Fresh Burst Body Wash.  All it takes is a quarter-sized dollop to create an abundance of bubbles certainly enough to cover me head-to-toe in perfumed foam.  (At ' there's a lot of head-to-toe of me to cover.)  The body wash rinses off easily leaving my skin feeling clean but not tight moisturized but not greasy oily or sticky.  The nicest part and the one I didn't really expect despite Dove's claims is that my skin does actually seem to be improving.  I've only been using the wash a short time about a week but my skin feels softer and doesn't look as dry--no rough patches or flaking skin.  Now I can apply lotion because I want to add an additional fragrance layer not because I have to in order to keep myself from looking like some kind of reptilian humanoid.I've been wanting to try Dove's line of body washes for some time now.  After experiencing the Dove Go Fresh Burst Body Wash I'm just sorry I waited so long. Wow!,Neutral
I typically buy B&BW; products but decided to give this product a try based upon the price. It has a nice fragrance but doesn't smell much like a nectarine in my opinion; it smells more like a creamy orange (if you are old enough to remember the orange dreamsicle you'll know what I mean). It is not too floral but still may be a bit perfume-y for a man's taste. It lathers up well but not quite as good as my B&BW; body wash. It does seem to leave my skin less dry after a shower than some other products so it gets good marks in that regard.I am not wild about the size of the bottle since it is a little unwieldy in the shower. But I put it in a smaller squeeze bottle to make it more manageable for my somewhat arthritic handsand that works fine.It seems to be a good value for the price. Nice Fragrance and Lather,Neutral
I want to be clear that is the product I'm reviewing.There are none of the little microbeads in this version of Dove's Body Wash.  And that's fine with me.First let's talk about the smelly-awesome!  Just no other word for it.  It reminds me of spring-it's fresh and clean and not overly fruity.  Some washes especially ones with fruit scents have a cloying scent-overly perfumed if you will-but not this one.  That's a win with me.The body wash is thick but it rinses off easily leaving no odd film that takes forever to rinse off and though it isn't thick enough or moisturizing enough to skip lotion in the winter I can see it being enough in the warmer months.For a two pack the price is right on par with Target Walmart or any other drugstore so I can't complain about that.All in all this is a nice body wash.  It left me feeling clean and I love the scent.  Here's hoping Dove does a body lotion with the same scent! Nectarine and White Ginger,Neutral
or as my wife described it in two ways  . kinda of like skunk . sweaty gym locker.  As far as lotion properties goes it goes on quick moisturizes decently and doesn't feel too greasy afterwards.  I think it smells like they mixed cologne straight into the lotion.  With only hand application it's pretty strong and can perfume a good radius around you.  In some ways this is much more economical that buying small bottles of aftershave with the added bonus of decent lotion.  The marketing team has definitely targeted this to men... dark bottle tackles dryness etc.  If you dare to use this as BODY lotion I think you'll be way overpowering with the cologne scent and will get a bunch of stares and people scrambling to get > feet away from you.  A faint smell stays even after you wash your hands so keep that in mind too.  On the other hand if you really really really like cologne then you'll love this product. Cologne like smell is way too strong...,Neutral
It's winter.It's itchy.I've been using Vaseling Aloe with Cucumber and I loved that but I finally ran out so I decided to try this variety.And....I'm just as pleased.It goes on smooth and drys quickly without leaving your skin feeling greasy or nasty.It does have a rather strong perfume scent which people may or may not like.I rather like it.Great for winter dryness if used daily.Highly recommended. Winter itch!!!,Neutral
My fianc&eacute; has used various Vaseline lotions for men and he likes them. I use them from time to time as well because he leaves them sitting out and I just need a quick pump of lotion to soothe my dry hands. It is great for men because it is light and absorbs quickly. Men hate to have greasy lotion hands. They don't have time to fool with it. Some reviewers think the scent is too strong. The scent doesn't bother me and I am bothered by strong perfumes. I get migraines. I don't think men would like this if it had an overly strong scent. I would recommend it for men and for women who like lotions that absorb quickly without a greasy feeling. Great for Men (and women),Neutral
This lotion applies smoothly and continues to feel moist on the skin for an extended period.  Too often skin lotions go on greasy and then sink in so fast the skin feels sticky before one is done rubbing it in.  Vaseline seems to have a knack for being able to make skin care products that strike the right balance.  The fragrance is pleasant does not overpower and is suitable for males and females but like any scented product may conflict with most women's perfumes.  Kudos to Vaseline for providing the product in a larger size than most competitors and also for shaping the bottle so it won't slip out of the hands.  After using this lotion it would probably be my first choice going forward. Noticeably better than my old brand,Neutral
My wonderful hubby uses lotion like women use perfume and he found he liked this product a lot.  Nice fragrance non greasy feeling and absorbs quickly making skin feel refreshed.  It's funny cause my  year old daughter actually likes the fragrance of this one also.  It actually is nice and not over powering.  Vaseline products have been around for a dogs age and they are a company that is keeping their product line up to par with the times and needs of todays consumer. Hubby Loves This,Neutral
I realize that manly men do not want to use flowery smelling lotion.  Thus the advent of men's lotion. This has a very strong musk like (strong men's cologne).  So strong that I had to tell my family to stop using it the smell was simply annoying and actually making me sneeze (when I used it myself) Reminds me of walking down the hallway of a middle school where you are assaulted by the odor of perfume that the kids have bathed in.  However I am sensitive to scent and if you are not perhaps this will be fine for you.The lotion itself not super moisturizing really for not too dry skin.  If you want a light lotion with a strong manly smell this is for you.  If not look elsewhere. Very strong smell  light moisturizing.,dry skin
These Vaseline Total Moisture lotions come in very large bottles and feel amazing on hands. I normally use hand and body lotions by Bath and Body Works. They have great scents and feel nice on skin. So when I tired out this lotion I was pleasantly surprised at how different but good feeling this Vaseline Total Moisture is compared to Bath and Body Works hand lotion.The Vaseline lotion has an interesting wet feeling to it where as most lotions of a a more greasy feeling to them that eventually absorbs into the skin. While I love my regular lotion I dislike using it when my hands are dried out from washing dishes or constant washing of them while cooking and cleaning. When my hands are dried out from water putting normal lotion on them feels strange and my skin doesn't absorb the lotion well. So they leave my hands feeling greasy. However this Vaseline Total Moisture lotion is perfect for using on hands dried out from water. Because of its wet feeling/formula it feels soothing to water-dried hands and absorbs in quickly.The scent is wonderful and smells delicious. It's not heavily perfumed/scented like other brands. It has just enough fragrance to leave your hands with a delicious but mild chocolate/coco scent. The lotion is dispenses from a pump at the top and can be re-locked for travel/storage by pressing down on it then twisting it a few times. I really enjoy these Vaseline Total Moisture lotions and how they make my hands feel through out the day and have been keeping a bottle in my kitchen beside my sink so I can put some on every time I need to wash my hands. Wonderful scent great lotion for hands dried out from washing them,Neutral
Vaseline Total Moisture Cocoa Radiant body lotion is a good moisturizing lotion.  I find it a bit thicker than other lotions which works for someone with skin as dry as mine.  The fragrance is a tad stronger than I care for and lasts for quite some time so be careful when wearing this lotion with other perfumes or body sprays.  Overall I'm quite pleased with this product and recommend it to my fellow dry-skinned friends. Feels good,Neutral
This came right on time as I just had a bad experience with a Suave body wash. It totally dried my skin out andleft me scaly like a alligator or croc which ever is worse. It may have also been the very hot showers I know I m not supposed to take them but they feel so good! Anyway I've been using the vaseline for a few days and I am seeing some results. I don't know about the stretch mark thing just yet but I will come back to do an update if things change. It's silky smooth doesn't make me feel or look greasy and the smell I love. I usually can't smell it on me after  while but other people do (if I don't spray perfume)To be honest I haven't used Vaseline lotion since my grandma was alive and well. (years ago) She would only use Vaseline or that's all I remember seeing! Guess it was good even back then! Smelling Like Chocolate,Neutral
This lotion is a cross between a body cream / butter and standard lotions because it is thicker than a lot of lotions. This is not a watery product.  It's rich and creamy but allows your skin to breathe.  It melts (absorbs) into your skin and leaves your skin feeling silky (not greasy or sticky) and truly moisturized.  In fact I applied it on my hands and body. Even after washing my hands my hands still felt moisturized.  Now that was a true testament to the effectiveness of Vaseline Total Moisture Cocoa Radiant body lotion at work.  During New York winter weather (the month of February) I took a shower; towel dried my skin and applied this lotion all over my body (not my face).  When I undressed eighteen hours later my body was still moisturized.  I can't say that I have had the same results with other lotions as my skin tends to be dry during winter months.  Usually I feel compelled to scratch my skin from all the dryness.  This product appears to have the true benefits of using pure Vaseline without the greasiness.  The dominating scent is the cocoa butter. If you like the scent of cocoa butter then you will love the scent of this product.  However if you do not like strong scents or the scent of cocoa butter then this product may not be for you.  The strong scent lingers for hours. It will definitely interfere with your scented oil cologne and / or perfume. It will probably overpower your splash or perfume water.  In fact it can be a substitute for your choice of fragrance such as splash oil perfume or cologne at least for a few hours. I had my family and co-workers asking Mmmm what is that you're are wearing?  In short this product gives you silky soft radiant moisturized scented skin that will make you love your skin.  I couldn't stop touching my skin and marveling at how fabulous it felt.  As if that's not enough this product has the benefit of combating skin discolorations because of all the cocoa butter.  I truly recommend this product.  If you don't like it then you can use it on just your lower extremities or gift it to someone else who will probably thank you for this unexpected sensuous treasure.  I totally love this product; I never want to be without this intensive wonder. Affair with my skin,Neutral
The new Cocoa Radiant lotion from Vaseline promises penetrating deeply infusing moisture at the top core and deep down layers of the skin.  When I first tried it I was surprised because the lotion is very thin and lightweight on the skin - doesn't lotion need to be thick and creamy to penetrate the deep down layers?  Certainly the body creams and butters I've used in the past have led me to believe this.Cocoa Radiant soaks into the skin very quickly leaving no greasy and/or oily patches behind.  As a hand cream I thought it worked great - after application it needed less than a minute to soak in so I could use it between tasks at the office or right after washing my hands.  As a general body moisturizer it worked well - I used it in the morning after a shower and my skin still felt soft and smooth in the afternoon.  But in certain areas prone to dryness - knees elbows and heels - the Cocoa Radiant lotion just wasn't enough.  My elbows felt dry and itchy less than an hour after application and I had to follow up with a thicker cream.However I think that for general use and for a handcream Cocoa Radiant is a great lotion.  It has a light scent of cocoa when first applied but after a few minutes it fades away making this a great lotion to layer with perfume too. Pretty good lotion for a pretty low price.,Neutral
I got this this cocoa radiant lotion thinking that it might smell like the cocoa butter suntan lotion that I used to use. This is not like it but there is a smell almost similar to that. The lotion itself is creamier than most lotions that I have purchased.I would not want to use this when I was using any other product that had a fragrance including cologne and perfume - that would really lead to some clashing scents because this is pretty strong.It does work well for a moisturizing lotion and seems to last longer than other lotions you might want to put on your skin. Cocoa memories,Neutral
I am a foo foo type of gal and usually go for the floral in deodorant or perfume. I tried the rose scented Dove and was not as happy with it as I am with the Fresh and Cool Essential. It is the only deodorant that I will use now as it makes me feel fresh all day long. The scent does not interfere with my perfume as you might think it would as it is not strong in odor. It keeps me fresh and dry even when I am sweating in  degree temps in the south this summer. I apply it after a shower at night and again in the morning. I even have it in the travel size to put in my purse when I am traveling overseas and not able to shower as often as when I am home. COOL AS A CUCUMBER,Neutral
I love love love smelling Dove products. They all smell simple: fresh and clean and don't compete with my perfume. I had used the normal Dove Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Invisible Solid Original Clean for years before I finally made the switch to this product.. and I am certainly glad that I did.I just love the fresh crisp smell of this deodorant. I have sensitive armpits (especially after shaving which I do every - days) and this product always helps with my irritation. After all nothing is more embarrassing than having to scratch your armpits in public :) haha. And being that I do not apply sparingly (I have a ritual of putting it on each armpit for  seconds and then repeating) this stick can normally last me - weeks... which is pretty dang good considering how much I put on. Not to mention the price is pretty dang good for a reliable product. Most of the times I buy as many as I can when I find it on sale at the grocery store.I also love the solid although I have to be honest it still shows up on clothing. I apply my deodorant with my shirt on normally just pulling down my collar and reaching in so of course I never get it on the sides of my clothing... but it still shows up in the armpit of the shirt when I take it off. Maybe its just because I put so much on but I'd rather have the stain than be smelly :)I would highly recommend this product. Smellin Dove Fresh :),Neutral
The Bohemian that continues to live in my old hippie soul still revels in the scent of nag champa. Triloka's Nag Champa perfume oil is the best I have used in a long time and nag champa and I go way back as far as the s! I am very happy that Triloka Nag Champa is available here at Amazon.Triloka's is a high quality nag champa alcohol free with a scent that lasts longer than other fragrances.  It is intense and the tiniest amount goes a very long way.  With that in mind this  dram bottle is an exceptional value with the beautiful pricing here at Amazon.  Also nice to know: no animal testing and no animal products.For those who aren't familiar with nag champa ask any baby boomer and they will most likely identify this exotic fragrance with Grateful Dead concerts hippies and flower children head shops yoga studios ashrams and anything New Age.Nag champa is an exotic fragrance from the Indian sub-continent a blend of Sandalwood Halmaddi resin and Champa flowers (also more commonly known in the West as Plumeria or Frangipani).  It is a genderless scent so therefore masculine application is as appropriate as feminine.Nag champa has wonderful aroma-therapeutic qualities.  Because of its calming effect on the mind it is useful to wear a small amount during yoga practice or meditation.Remember Triloka Nag Champa is intense and a little goes a very long way. Apply sparingly...then dance the hippie twirl in delight or go deeply into your favorite yoga pose. Peace and Namaste. High quality inexpensive Nag Champa ~ my favorite fragrance,long way
I love this perfume oil.  It only takes a small amount to do a big job.  It lasts all day and smells incredible.  It absorbs quickly and completely.  No oily residue.  It has it's own unique scent. I get compliments on how good I smell.  I love it! Long Lasting Smell,Neutral
I have tried just about every fancy/expensive skin care line out there.... this line and this product is my mainstay and can't live without it.  Never have a problem and it does a good job and must make a difference as folks ask me what I use as I am OLD!  But skin still is about  years behind my true age... so this serum and the eye cream that I use twice day must be doing a good job!  (Very sensitive fair skin that reacts to strong chemicals and perfumes/soaps/etc.  This line eye cream is the only one I have found I can wear at night... and not wake up with puffy/allergic eyes... yes the price fluctuates but look at how expensive all the other skin care products are!!) Used for several years and it is my daily serum/moisturizer!,Neutral
Great soap. I don't care for peppermint which is Dr. Bronner's best-known soap. Their almond soap however is really impressive. It gets you clean which is the most important part rinses easily all that basic soap stuff and it has a wonderful sophisticated fragrance that seems to go on and on not a harsh or cheap smelling perfume.I once used Bee & Flower Ginseng soap and this Dr. Bronner's almond soap reminds me of it as far as sharing an exotic sophisticated scent. Dr. Bronner's soap will actually CLEAN you as well as smell nice.Very highly recommended. Every single guy ought to know about this soap. I'd never wear cologne but the extremely subtle scent left by this soap could practically come with a must-get-laid guarantee.Wonderful stuff. Wouldn't want to live without it. Soap is basic and personal and Dr. Bronner's almond soap is a suave choice. I absolutely love it. Sensational gentle soap w a sophisticated fragrance,Neutral
*****This almond and hemp soap from Dr. Bronner's is truly amazing! It has none of the harmful ingredients found in many commercial soaps like sodium laryl sulfate etc. It's pure and smells absolutely fabulous. The scent is very natural and authentic too not perfume-like. One thing you should be aware of is that it doesn't foam up a lot because it has no chemical foaming agents; this however is fine by me. I just use a little bit more or clean up without the foam.I like that it has natural oils in it as well so that it's not drying. I use it solely as a bath soap but apparently all of the Dr. Bronner's Soaps can be used for everything from body care to household cleaning. I love this soap and find it gentle enough to even use on my face yet it does clean thoroughly. I love how it makes shaving my legs easy as well because of the oils.It leaves little to no residue. I have read that it can be used to brush your teeth do the dishes and bathe your pets! The only thing I have found that it doesn't work too well for is as a shampoo but I have color-treated hair and it seems to leave it dry. If you have natural healthy hair you can probably use it for shampoo as well.I am hooked and plan to use Dr. Bronner's exclusively from now on as a mainstay in my home. I've been looking for a natural and versatile product like this for years.Highly recommended.***** Great Natural Even AMAZING Soap!,little bit
Cold weather and forced air heating makes my skin look like alligator skin in the winter.  I also have a problem with painful cracked skin if I don't moisturize.  I have tried a large number of different moisturizing lotions over the years and found that Cetaphil works best for me.I LIKE:. Cetaphil is effective in treating my dry skin - both appearance and texture of my skin is better I don't get cracked skin on heals and other spots that crack if I don't do anything. Cetaphil has no scent - very important to me as I don't like perfumes especially before going to bed as smells tend to keep me awake. Pump works well and consistently. My skin does not feel greasy after the cream is appliedI was pleased to see that November  issue of Consumer Reports rated Cetaphil at the top of their rankings. They found that it was twice as effective as the lowest ranking cream in their study.  Consumer Reports study used a special device that measured the the skin moisture in a temperature-controlled environment in a number of tests spanning multiple hours intervals ( hours  hours  hours).  In terms of cost Consumer Reports put per ounce of Cetaphil in the middle of the range . cents with the highest tested being . per oz and lowest tested . per oz. The current Amazon price is a bit better than the price quoted by Consumer Reports at . cents per oz.This stuff works I recommend!Ali Julia review Effective for moisturizing and cost effective too,dry skin
I am sensitive to fragrances and have headaches if a lotion is perfumed. Cetaphil is terrific! None of the usual troubles that cause me to have to throw out new bottles of moisturizers when I try new-to-me products.Ideally I want a moisturizer that can be used on body and face but that has been hard to find. I have very sensitive facial skin. Despite being well past my teen years my face will break-out if a lotion is sticky or has any number of ingredients that trouble my skin. This one causes no such problems.Cetaphil does what I want it keeps my skin smooth and hydrated. Some moisturizers wear off after a very short time but this one lasts many hours. The consistency is not runny or watery not pore-clogging-thick. It's in the Goldilocks zone just right!Perhaps the best feature is the reasonable price and good-sized bottle. The search for a good face and body lotion can lead to some very high-priced products. This one is a great value and doesn't leave me feeling abused by having to pay $ $ or more for little  or  ounce jars and tubes of over-hyped face cream (take that Olay Lancome Neutrogena!). I am very pleased and will buy this again and again. Works on face and body. Doesn't trigger allergies,Neutral
My expectations were that this would be either unscented or have a light scent; instead it has a strong unpleasant perfumy smell. I can't imagine women liking it and I think all men will detest it.Also (and surprising to me given that it's not all that inexpensive) is that it seems to require far more of it than I would have thought. Comparing it to the foaming pump-bottle cleansers I've been using (at about the same price per ounce) this is clearly much more expensive to use.I can't return it because there's nothing wrong with it but I'm sorry I bought a  pack. Cheap Perfume smell & expensive given how much you have to use,Neutral
This is a wonderful hair conditioner which when used after shampooing with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Shampoo does everything it promises for fine limp hair like mine.I am an older gal (an aging baby-boomer) with thinning hair living in a very humid climate which makes my fine hair hang dull and lifelessly. I am particular about the products I use as well preferring organic without parabens or synthetic fragrances. For my moneyAvalon Organics Shampoo Biotin B-Complex Thickening -Ounces (Pack of )andAvalon Organics Conditioner Biotin B-Complex Thickening -Ounces (Pack of )fit the bill beautifully. My hair feels thicker and stronger with more body volume and shine. The ends are less split or broken. My sensitive scalp also feels nourished and more healthy. What's more this gentle conditioner makes combing-out much easier without leaving a heavy residue. Having very long hair like I do that's especially nice for me. Finally the natural fragrance of the herbs is subtle and fresh and not at all perfumey.This is yet another fine product from Avalon Organics and paired with its partner shampoo it really is the perfect formula for healthier scalp and thicker fuller hair.I have also discovered that purchasing it from Amazon is much less expensive than at the local health food store by as much as $ to $. Wonderful conditioner for fine limp hair,Neutral
My husband age  has had a problem with losing hair in recent years. He also has very fine limp hair. After using this shampoo I noticed the fullness of his hair and he hasn't lost hair since using this product. He also uses the conditioner.  My husband shampoos his hair daily.There is NO shampoo on the market that will regrow hair despite what the infomericals tout. But by using this shampoo you can maintain the hair you do have.I then decided to try it on myself. Yes I have had some hair thinning too (age ). Since using this shampoo my hair never looked so good. Full volume and it is wonderful smelling. Light not perfumey.  I was breaking out on my scalp but not anymore. This shampoo treats your scalp also. I do not use the conditioner as the shampoo leaves my hair very soft which is enough for me.I like the fact that the ingredients are organic. No sulfates etc. I found that purchasing the  pack from Amazon.com works out to be a good savings.  For the price I would pay for  bottles I get an extra bottle free.We are sold on this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with hair and/or scalp problems.  Star Shampoo,Neutral

The ends are less split or broken. My sensitive scalp also feels nourished and more healthy. What's more I don't need to shampoo my hair as often.  Having very long hair like I do that's especially nice for me.  Finally the natural fragrance of the herbs is subtle and fresh and not at all perfumey.This is yet another fine product from Avalon Organics and paired with its conditioner it really is the perfect formula for healthier scalp and thicker fuller hair.I have also discovered that purchasing it from Amazon is much less expensive than at the local health food store by as much as $ to $ per bottle! Once again Amazon offers an amazing value! Does everything it promises,Neutral
I purchased this based on reading the reviews. I have been a Caress (daily silk) user for years. I wanted to switch to something natural & decided to give this a try.Upon opening the packaging I noticed a strong aroma of peppermint. I was a bit hesitant because I do not want to smell like peppermint all day or have it clash with my perfume. What I found was the complete opposite. While the peppermint scent was strong upon application the scent fades quickly after drying off. The best part is that it leaves your skin feeling tingly & your senses invigorated. It makes a great wake-up soap to start out  your day. Although it has Olive Oil Hemp Oil Jojoba Oil & Peppermint Oil I did not notice my skin to be soft after use. This was disappointing but honestly the invigorating tingle & natural ingredients made up for it.I found it first at my local Target store for $. a bar. Once I had tried it & decided to make it my new bar soap I purchased a  pack on Amazon for $. ($. a bar) so I am pleased with the slight discount.The other bonus to this soap (versus store brands) is that it doesn't get soft & mushy when stored in a plastic soap case. I find it to be a very long lasting soap so the higher price compared to mass market soaps is worth it. INVIGORATING.....LOVE IT!,Neutral
I just love Cetaphil gentle cleanser and bought this one by mistake.  It works and that's why I gave it  stars but it is so STRONG smelling that I simply can not use it.  I do not have a problem with scents or perfume but this is over powering.  It's so bad that I stopped washing my face with it after one try and I cant even wash my hands with it as the smell creeps into my mouth and nose.Unless you have no sense of smell do not buy this. My gosh the smell....,Neutral
I've used Cetaphil products for years and liked that they are mild and no fragranceThis lotion is thick and rich with no fragrance.  I like that as I have sensitive skin and don't like strong perfume products.It keeps my dry skin smooth and I highly recommend this lotion.I use the Subscribe and Save program and it's handy to have this on hand all the time. Excellant Lotion!,sensitive skin
I have been using this leave in for about  years now and I love it.  I continuously look for a product to compare that I can find locally but to no avail.  Amazon has great prices and free s/h so I will continue to purchase it online.  I have very thick very long (hiplength) African American texturized (relaxed but not bone straight) hair and this leave in is thick enough to spread through my hair to moisturize it really well but with no buildup.  The ingredients are great and I love that there is hardly a smell as I am sensitive to perfumes and fragrances.  I usually use coconut oil on top of this product to seal in the moisture.  Coconut oil is also the th ingredient.  I only wish it came in a bigger tube.  Try it! Wonderful leave in!,Neutral
I used to buy my shampoo and conditioner based on cost. I'd buy the cheapest thing I could. Then I got a sample of the Dove Cool Moisture Cucumber and Green Tea shampoo and conditioner and my hair life has changed. I love how it makes my hair feel - soft and light and looking beautiful. And I love how it makes it smell - not like perfume and yet fresh. Will Have No Other Product Now,Neutral

Dove Unscented is a good product for those people with dry skin or allergies to perfumes. I've been using it for about  years and have no complaints. It lathers well rinses off easily and doesn't leave a buildup in or on your shower walls or floor. Anyone dissatisfied with their current product and searching for something better should try Dove Unscented. Best for People with Allergies,Neutral
My husband uses the Irish Spring bar soap and I like it.  I decided to get him the body wash.  It lathers really well with just a little gel.  However I made the mistake of getting the hr scent gel and it has a perfume smell to it that lasts and lasts and it gives me a sore throat and a headache.  And I admit I am very sensitive to certain perfumes and this is one I cannot stand to be around.  I had some on my hands and have washed my hands several times trying to get rid of this smell and its still there.  So it you enjoy is particular fragrance rest assured it will last and last.  Perhaps for some of you that's a good thing.  Unfortunately not so much for me.  It's going in the garbage or he's sleeping in the guest room from now on.  I will try the regular Irish Spring gel.  Hopefully it's not as &#;lingering&#; and has a &#;fresher&#; smell like the bar soap. Scent gives me a headache,Neutral
I'm usually up late and by the time I'm ready for bed washing my face seems like a chore.  This has solved all of that.  They are easy to use clean great get off my mascara and leave my face feeling clean without any dryness.  I have very dry skin so I follow up with a moisturizer.  They have a  perfumed smell but it doesn't bother me.  The wipes are strong enough that you can turn them over and use the other side and they stay intact.  Really like this product. Perfect for Lazy Me - Cleans Well,dry skin
I used this product for about a couple of days. I stopped using it because it has a scent to it. I usually break out when the products have any kind of scent. It wasnt a strong perfume scent it was a nice clean scent but I decided that it was not the right product for me. Loreal RevitaLift,Neutral
First off I couldn't get over the smell. It's loud artificial and annoying. It didn't moisturized very well either. I think it's overpriced perfume. I returned it. Review,Neutral
In the New York winters it's easy to get dry and scaly. This cream would definitely be too rich for summer but for winter it smoothes on beautifully.  I would recommend it especially for heels and cuticles.  It's a thick white cream (not at all a lotion  butter is a good description) It's very rich and does tend to sit on your skin for longer than other moisturizers (so I wouldn't use it on days I expected to be very active  or before the gym)  but for before bed  or for very dry areas its very effective.Re scent - it has a soft scent  but nothing special.  I would like it more if it had had a nicer perfume.Edited to add - it's now  and I've  used this for  winters.  It's def too thick for a summer lotion but in winter when your heels feel like they are turning into hooves  this cream really does help soften them back to human appearance.  My cuticles often split and bleed in the dry winters here  but not if I use this cream.  I  used often and it really helps. Very rich and buttery,Neutral
I was very excited to be able to try this product.  I tend to have very dry body skin and am always on the lookout for a product that will help.While labeled as a body butter I ended up using it on my hands more than anywhere for the last week or so and am very very pleased.  My hands are very dry to begin with and the Indiana winters are very hard on them even with wearing gloves religiously.  I put the butter on them in the morning and again right before bed.  It made a significant different in how my skin feels.  Another big test is that I cooked Thanksgiving dinner which requires lots of hand washing.  Even with that my skin is much softer than it was this time last year.  I actually get cracks in the skin around the top of the fingernail and there is no sign of that this year -- yea !The aroma is subtle but pleasant.  This is also a plus for me since I don't really like having lotions etc. with a lot of scent --  I like to wear perfume and don't like the clashing aromas.The only negative I can find is that the butter is a bit greasy when you first put it on but it absorbs quickly and isn't really a problem.For people with really dry skin this product is definitely worth a try.  I will also be ordering the lotion version of this product in the future to carry in my purse. Great product !,great product
We've had a bunch of the Yes To Carrots product line and they are consistenly good products.  The Body Butter is a quality moisturizing cream that does the job of hydrating your skin without an overwhelming scent or unappealing skin-feel (e.g. greasy or pasty).I can't vouch for any extra effectiveness these ingredients have over what's found in normal Body Butters but it works and I don't feel like I'm slathering on chemicals dyes and perfumes.  A huge plus for me. Strange Name - Great Product!,great product
I had stopped using creams and oils because they left me feeling greasy like wearing a grease wet suit!  I tried this cream because my legs had become so dry they were flaky and scaly looking and the skin on my hands was looking thin and brittle.  Not attractive! I was drawn to try this cream because of the list of natural ingredients.  I have been using this cream for about  days now at least once a day if not twice.  I love the feel of it going on it is very smooth and a little goes a long way.  It absorbs in within a few moments and my skin feels smooth and supple all day.  Every feel like your skin is 'pulling'?  This cream will take care of that.  It has a very slight odor in the jar which disappears when applied.  I have no contrast with this cream and wearing perfume.  I see a very significant difference in skin texture and would recommend this cream to anyone. smooth sexy skin,long way
Pros:- Moisturizes well.- Is a very dense cream.- Absorbs quickly (the white color goes away)Cons:- Fragrance definitely not for fragrance sensitive individuals.- Leaves a greasy film on skin.- Hard to rub on skin and get it even.This is a very firm body butter.  It is not fluffy in texture it is very dense.  It takes a little work to get it out of the jar and takes a lot of rubbing to get it even on your skin.  It absorbs fairly quickly and seems to moisturize really well.There are a couple things that I don't like about this cream.  It leaves a greasy film on my skin making it slippery and oily feeling.  Given that I live in Minnesota and it is winter I don't mind this too much right now.  In the summer it would be miserable.Then there is the smell it has a very perfume-like smell to it.  I am really sensitive to fragrances especially floral or perfume-like ones.  I really don't like the fragrance and it gives me a bit of a headache to wear this stuff.  I was really surprised that they added fragrance to it and so much of it.  The ingredients are fairly benign except for the fragrance.Because of the oily film this leaves the fragrance and firmness of the butter I will never use this product again.  If it weren't for the fragrance I think it would be a good product if you are willing to tolerate some greasiness; it does seem to moisturize really well.I got this through the Vine program so at least I didn't pay for it. A pretty good cream except for the smell,Neutral
I have a few other Yes to Carrots products that I really love so I was eager to try their Body Butter.  During this time of year (fall heading into winter) I get very dry skin and this product does an excellent job of moisturizing and taking care of any flaking problem areas.This is a lighter body butter than some brands but it is more moisturizing than many others that I've tried.  When you first put it on it's a little greasy for a minute or so but then it sinks right in.  (I sometimes use thick body butters as hand lotions but because this has a little of that greasiness at first I'll more likely use it as it was designed -- for my arms and legs.)The scent is also very light and natural and it dissipates after a few minutes; heavy perfumes in scented products can sometimes set my allergies off but I haven't experienced that with this product.  The scent is so light in fact that you could easily wear perfume or cologne and not notice the scent. I've been re-applying the Body Butter in fact just to keep smelling it since it smells so good!It also imparts a slight sheen to the skin but it's very subtle and light so this should also be fine for men to use.I love the fact that Yes to Carrots products are made with all-natural ingredients and this lotion is no exception.  The ingredients in this body butter include dead sea water; algae extracts; almond jojoba and avocado oils; and the orange color products that this brand is known for: carrot seed oil pumpkin and sweet potatoes.As a final note one tub of this is a very generous size since a little of the Body Butter goes a long way.  It makes my skin so soft and smooth and I've been slathering it on just because I enjoy the scent and feel of it.  Highly recommended!UPDATE ON //:  I'm about to place another order for this product because I love it so much.  I've honestly never used an entire tub of lotion but this product is so wonderful that I'm scraping the plastic to get it all out. I use it everyday on my arms and legs and one tub has lasted me about six months.  After using it more I can also say that the texture reminds me more of the lighter body butters from The Body Shop (which I prefer) as opposed to the thicker body butters from Bath and Body Works (which I don't like). Great lotion! Lush and creamy!,long way
The list of natural ingredients on this product is very impressive. The fact that the sellers donate large portions of profit to sustain agriculture is also impressive. The product itself is pretty impressive. I used it on hands so dry that my knuckles were cracked open and bleeding. After one application (left on overnight) they were no longer bleeding. After  nights the cracks were no longer visible. Applied in the day time to legs so dry I could write my name in them. I was left with incredibly healthy-looking and soft-to-the-touch skin and it stayed that way even after my shower the next day.  For those who don't like heavy fragrance this would be wonderful. There is hardy any smell to speak of and what little exists is not perfume-y.  My sensitive skin had no negative reaction and even my -year-old daughter could use it without a reaction.  Initially I thought the price was a little high. After I realized how very little is needed for an application I realized that this is an extremely reasonable price especially when compared to similar products from companies like Bath and Body Works with a much higher price tag. I didn't give it  stars because I felt like it was a little greasy on my hands. Some other reviewers felt differently. It may be because I applied it so heavily.  And being a female consumer I think the packaging could use some artistic embellishment. This is pretty unexciting. How about some art using carrots?  Overall very good. Great ingredients. Very nice product.,sensitive skin
Rubs in well I live in Minnesota and in the winter my legs thighs would burn (itch) wearing clothes right after my shower. So I put it on right away after my shower and as long as I use it my skin doesn't get the burning dry feeling. It is thick and easy to apply not greasy though it is heavy (I slather it on pretty much). Not a lot of smell to it so it doesn't fight with your perfume which is a good thing. I like the fact that it has natural ingredients and no gluten!I will use it again. Like It!,Neutral
I have problems with calluses on my feet and was impressed with the way that Yes to Carrots moisturized without leaving my skin feeling greasy. When combined with my daily Pedegg regimen my calluses have nearly disappeared in a week and I have noticed that the cuticles on my fingers are in better shape too.The only drawback for me was the smell - I didn't really care for it and it is pretty stong clashing with my perfume. I'd prefer an unscented version of the cream but I'm willing to forgo the smell for the other benefits namely heels that are no longer cracked. Great for really dry skin,dry skin
I am aware that all scents react with peoples' personal chemistries differently.  I am also aware of the difference between Eu De Toilette Eu De Perfume & Body Mist.  All  types of scented products are made with varying amounts of scent.I love this scent but it doesn't last all day on my skin.  Again people's chemistries vary.  I love that it isn't fruity or flowery.  It is just clean and crisp smelling.  Delish!It is an alcohol-based body mist spray which is pretty much anything you buy unless it is a higher end perfume.I have the mini & the full size because I do have to touch up during the day.  It is worth it because the smell is wonderful.  People say that I smell like I literally just stepped out of the shower. It also kind of smells like my laundry detergent so that helps.Unfortunately VS no longer makes the body wash in this scent.  Back when they did I would pair the body wash lotion & body mist together to try to hold on to the scent for longer staying power on my skin.The bottom line:  Great smell to it but doesn't last all day.  stars for great smell but poor staying power.,Neutral
Wife requested some Victorias Secret perfumes for a gift.  I went with this one.  Name says it all the best I can describe the scent as is 'clean' or 'fresh'.  Not that powerful flowery smell or the old lady chemical smell some others have.  This one just smells nice and it's not overly powerful so you can still have her in the car with you without wanting to roll down the windows or wonder what smell she's trying to hide with her perfume.Not too strong too flowery or chemical smelling.  This is the best perfume my wife has in my opinion and I get the credit for picking it out for her.If you are searching for your wife or girlfriend go with this one it has my recommendation. Review for the guys.... This is a good gift for her.,Neutral
I bought this product after reading raving reviews about it online watching videos and everything from almost every beauty and hair care blog and website out there. They were all saying how perfect this is because it smells good because it's so simple and quick and especially because it's so affordable.That is why I immediately jumped and bought myself a pack of  instead of trying just one. Well that was a bit of a rash decision; the product isn't bad. It really works very well with my hair and with all kinds of hair it really costs a fraction of the price of most other masks and it's so simple and fast it's amazing. The smell however is a bit of a problem for me.I couldn't pinpoint the smell it felt like it was changing constantly.In a nutshell the scent reminded me of one of those bottles of perfume there are for younger girls who want to feel like adults. You know the colorful bottles smaller ones made for tweens early teens those bottles that sit next to the glitter body lotions and stuff. Those things have a very strong sweet scent and that's what this smells like.It felt like I was rubbing candy in my hair and I didn't like it at all. It's very very strong.If you like sweet scents or if you don't mind I really recommend this from the bottom of my heart.If you're more sensitive to that type of thing I would steer clear of this product. The scent it just a bit overwhelming,Neutral
I've read some reviews on here about how this didn't do anything and/or the smell was bad and lingered.I'll start by saying that they must have either gotten a bad batch ranging in really strong smell and/or it was an old batch that wasleft to linger. Either way the ones I got are perfect. The smell is not strong (I should know. My mother has this coconut butter perfume that is stupid strong and I can't stand it. This is weak in smell compared to that.) and it's done wonders on my hair. I know this because I bought this specifically because I was going to bleach my hair and needed a deep conditioner and it works.I had to bleach my hair twice and I have since used this conditioner (no shampoo after bleaching) and left it in the  minutes maybe more to have my hair come out silky smooth. That's saying a lot from me because I have naturally curly thick hair. I'm mixed so I've got my fathers hair more than my mom's but this did what it was suppose to do. It kept my hair from feeling like straw (as it would after bleaching) and it's even worked on the tips of my hair which were really fried after the  bleaching sessions. Keep in mind that I shower in the morning and at night (I only wash my hair  day out of the week. When not bleached.) and was using this each time as I wanted to strengthen my hair again before I tone it.Anyways it does what I need it to do. Keep my hair from looking like a straw man's head! Works great!,Neutral
I am quite sensitive to all beauty products that contain perfume. I break out in a rash or hives. It seems that many products use a masking fragrance to hide smells - but as you can guess the scents are buried somewhere deep inside.This Olay product is wonderful. I can use it and not have a reaction. The SPF  is a nice addition.I see that the manufacturer messed with the formula a while back. I sure hope they don't change it again because it works very well for my skin. Fragrance Issues? Try This Product,Neutral
I like to use this face wash a couple times each week as an exfoliating wash.  The micro beads aren't too scratchy or overabundant an issue I have run into with other scrubs.  The only thing I dislike about this cleanser is the smell.  It isn't necessarily bad but it is a pungent sort of aroma that can be overbearing.  I would describe the fragrance as being like an elderly woman's perfume mixed with cough syrup.  I wish it was just unscented or lightly scented or just had that clean smell rather than a perfumed flowery smell.  It keeps me from using the product more frequently and makes me wonder if it is gentle enough on my skin having such an overpowering fragrance.  I still recommend it but if you have a sensitive sense of smell like I do take that into account. A gentle but strong-smelling exfoliator,Neutral
Love this stuff it's very moisturizing and smells so good. The scent lingers for hours almost like a perfumed lotion but in soap form. It has a clean scent kind of flowery. Love the smell!,Neutral
I have searched far and wide (and wasted a lot of money) in search of the &#;perfect moisturizer.&#; It doesn't exist but this (for me) is as close as it gets. It doesn't smell (no dyes or perfumes) it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy dirty or &#;coated&#; feeling it doesn't make me break out (a big factor for me) and it moisturizes pretty well. This product does not contain any type of sunscreen as many facial moisturizers do. However for me this is a benefit as I have NEVER been able to find a good moisturizer that includes sunscreen and doesn't make my face feel oily and cause breakouts.

I was hit by a car and completely disabled for two years.  Normally I'm a very active person and a lifetime athlete.  So when I was finally able to return to my head-cracking activities--I have a helmet of course so I should really call them helmet-cracking activities--I realized that not only did I get fat and weak but my hair teeth and skin had all changed.So at some point in this comeback I had an odd allergic reaction to suntan lotion which caused dry itchy scaly bumps on my arms shoulders and back.  Never had this problem in my life.  I guess it's the lack of sweat because normally I do a lot of outdoor sports and sweat a lot.I saw a dermatologist about it and he prescribed moisturizer--and to stop scratching.  He gave me a bag of sample size Aveeno colloidal oatmeal moisturizer bottles but it wasn't very effective so I started using Aveeno's more hardcore Eczema therapy moisturizer which was better but it still only really worked and felt good when I applied it.  Then I tried Nutragena (spelling?  I forget) which was better than Aveeno but I still felt the need to wash it off after a few hours.Finally I sampled this lotion and never looked back.  It does the job smells good feels good I don't feel the need to wash it off later because it doesn't feel like I spread cake frosting on myself as I did with the others and it's even decent on my face.The scent is very clean.  It doesn't smell like perfume or flowers or potpourri.  This may be the only product which has a 'unisex' smell.  It reminds me of fresh talc but it doesn't feel like chalk.Good stuff.  Both my wife and I are using it after showering and we both prefer it to other products we've tried. Exactly what I needed.,Neutral
It's a pretty lightweight lotion with a very strong scent. The scent is perfumey strong and not all that pleasant. I haven't noticed any firming of my skin at all and made sure to use it daily anywhere that I felt is a problem area. Also this lotion is way too lightweight for me the moisturizing doesn't seem to be enough even initially upon application let alone after an hour or two. This product does not seem to be up to normal Nivea standards very disappointing. Disappointing,Neutral
I bought this at a local warehouse store a few days ago; however I used it only twice and had to return it since the smell was so strong! I can usually handle fairly strong smells but this one was incredibly strong -- in a bad way! Usually the scent of most lotions will also dissipate after the lotion sinks in but this one lasted for about eight hours and interfered with my perfume.Since I only used it twice I can't speak to its skin-tightening abilities. I really did like how light-feeling it was and it also adds a nice glean to your skin. If you don't mind the smell it seems like a nice lotion but just be warned that it may be too strong! If you are at all sensitive to smells I definitely recommend smelling this before you purchase it.I feel bad giving this a low review since I wasn't able to use it long enough to see if it really does firm the skin but in my mind a product needs to excel in all areas to be a winner and this one falls short because the smell is much too strong and noxious.  I ended up buying Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion Daily Shade Formula SPF  from Amazon after returning the Nivea lotion and have been very pleased with that one.  While the Alba doesn't have the skin-firming features it contains SPF and has as very subtle scent so I consider it a good trade-off. Don't buy if you're sensitive to strong smells!,Neutral
Not bad at all but a bit heavy if you want something light. It's great lotion as most Nivea products are. It's harder to find the un-scented Nivea's these days which I loved because it does not mix with colognes or perfumes. Overall a great lotion with a medium scent.. it will wear off by the mid day though. Strong Scent,Neutral
This is a great everyday lotion that is moisturizing yet not thick or greasy.  It's also odorless so it won't compete with your perfume which I love.  Great consistency and one of the better inexpensive body lotions I have ever used. Great Everyday Body Lotion,Neutral
Growing up in Europe I used to see my parents using Nivea creams a lot. As an adult it took me a while to go back to that brand maybe because the association with my parents made me consider Nivea too old fashioned? Shame on me. This is hands down the BEST body lotion I have been able to find in both supermarkets as well as department stores:PROS:- smooth texture: comes out of the bottle easily rubbs on body easily and evenly;- fast absorption: you can almost watch it soak into your skin leaving NO film residue behind;- non-greasy quality: makes your skin dewey but not oily; your clothes and stockings are safe; I put it on directly after a shower/bath (when my skin is still slightly damp) and then let my body air dry while I progress with my morning routine; within minutes it is safe to put your clothes on;- superb moisturization quality: no ashy flakes in sight! leaves skin plump!- boutique scent: it is sofisticated clean and barely there...will not overpower your perfume;- price: VERY reasonable for a body lotion!CONS:- The larger ( ml a bottle) size comes with a pump; I like that option better due to the ease of application;Enjoy!

This lathers up very well feels very moist and non drying does not aggravate my acne prone skin and is unscented.  That said for use on a daily basis I think I prefer a cleanser that does not lather up as much so I don't have to work so hard to remove all the residual suds.  Also although I hate flowery perfume-y scents it does have a slight chemical-something non-scent that is not unpleasant but I do not particularly enjoy smelling it either.Overall a good product that I would recommend and may buy again. great product but unscented scent not great,great product
Any product by Basis is a good product. My wife says this washes her face very well. The only negative was that it has a heavy perfume smell. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The product was packaged well and arrived in good condition. Face wash,Neutral
I just go this in the mail turned it over and saw sodium laureth sulfate in one of the first ingredients. Given all the negative press for SLS lately and because that I'm trying to find something for my sensitive skin I have to return it (and with no free shipping either). There's also perfume in it.If SLS and perfume don't bother you it's probably worth the buy but I'd probably try one tube from a local drugstore before buying a -pack.

This creme is great especially on dry flaky skin caused by cold weather. I use it all over after showering each morning and my skin stays soft and smooth all day!

I've used this product for years. A doctor recommended two brands to me and I chose this brand to try. I've been with it ever since. It absorbs into the skin easily. If anyone has a sensitivity to perfumes this is the best product for you. It has no perfumes and is not greasy. If the area you apply the Creme becomes greasy your using to much. When skin is dry it's uncomfortable and itchy. Eucerin Calming Creme used daily eliminates that discomfort. I also use it on some scars from a previous cellulitis infection. The scars will become painful unless moisturized daily and the Eucerin is safe to use without fear of causing another bout of infection. Because the Eucerin has no perfumes I don't have to worry about an allergic reaction on the scarred areas aggravating an already sensitive spot. Highly Recommended,Neutral
I have incredibly sensitive skin and so does my daughter. It's common knowledge around my household that using the wrong detergent or hand/body lotion could result in itchy rashy skin.This product is the only thing that soothes and moisturizes my skin while maintaining a balance of a thick consistency that's creamy yet light enough that I can immediately feel my skin soft and smooth after applying it.It's also gentle enough to use on my  / year old daughter. My dermatologist recommended this product for both myself and my daughter (I started using this on her at a year old). I've never used anything else since. I'm a very happy customer  years and going. I even recommended a friend of mine who suffers from Eczema to try it. It even soothes her skin!The reason why this product is so valuable is simple: It contains natural oatmeal and several sources of rich moisturizers. It soothes irritated skin even after pesky razor burn. It also prevents my skin from becoming dry cracked and itchy. I love that this product is fragrance free because perfumes and dyes commonly irritate sensitive skin. It's dermatologically tested and the brand I trust for me and my daughter's skincare.

I have crazy sensitive skin prone to dermatitis hives itchies of all kinds. It's also very dry. I have to moisturize every inch of myself after a shower--from hairline to tips of toes.Since they seem to be discontinuing my longtime moisturizer by Lubriderm (seriously sensitive) I decided to give Eucerin a shot. It's excellent and I'm adding it to my anti-skin-woes arsenal.This really is rich. A very thick cream. Unless your skin is moist from a bath or shower prepare to have to do a little muscular rubbing to spread it. However after your shower or bath when you've patted dry but are still moist--this is perfect and smooths on richly but easily. Thick enough that a little goes a long way. Very moisturizing even for my super dry heels.I like that it has no scent not just because it's less irritating that way (as many have allergies to scent/perfume) but it allows your own choice of perfume to shine and not be interefered with by a lotion's scent.A winner. Recommended for dry skin sufferers especially the uber-sensitive.Mir A very rich thick moisturizer without scent and non-irritating: I love it!,long way

Several people had told me about this oil and I needed something to keep my hair from being so dry and fly-away.  I used it several times and it certainly made my hair less dry and static-filled but unfortunately I found the scent too strong for my personal taste.  It's not a bad scent; in fact I'm sure many people wouldn't mind it at all but it was overpowering to me.  I tend to be sensitive to smells so if you are bothered by heavy perfumes or similar scented products I recommend you try an unscented version. Oil is lovely but the scent is strong,Neutral
I really like this perfume it has everything for a man. I really recommend this seller. No problems at all I hope I can buy something else in the not distance future Awesome,Neutral
Axe has another fine product in it's expanding line of h&ba; items designed for men. When this line of products first came out on the market  I was prepared to be disappointed by another line of items for men. Usually these lines are too flowery  perfume-based  or don't do a great job of what they were designed to do.The Axe line has been the clear exception. From their deodorant  body wash and shampoos  Axe continues to satisfy with quality products that perform beyond expectations. A little goes a long way  so they are also a great value for the money. Another great product in the Axe line,great product
I haven't used any other AXE products - I tend to avoid perfumed products which is the impression I have gotten of them.  This paste however is mostly fragrance-free and does a good job of keeping my hair the way I put it.  It has a slight scent in the can but none I can discern on my hair.The paste itself is a stiff blueish butter - scoop out a bit on your fingertip rub it around in your hands and work it through your damp hair.  It then provides pretty good hold for the day.  Not greasy at all and definitely not stiff or crunchy. While it doesn't exactly rinse clean with water it does with shampoo.The container itself is a nice touch.  The prutruding fins on either side make it easy to open and close the container tightly with wet or slippery hands.I don't wear my hair exceedingly spiky or anything so I can't vouch for that but it has the right amount of hold for an old hipster like me. Functional unoffensive,Neutral
The Axe paste is pretty good for a lightweight product and does exactly as promised in not being crunchy.  I found applying to damp (not wet) hair helped performance substantially.Here's why I won't go out of my way to buy it again:) Leaves hair feeling waxy.  Better than crunchy?  Arguably.) Made my hair super-curly.  I mean I have some natural wave but this made curls like nothing I've ever used.) I didn't care for the scent at all.  I wish Axe didn't feel the compulsive need to perfume everything.Overall it's not a bad product.  It's just not good enough for me.  I'll head back to my Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner when I'm done with this tub. I'll use the rest but won't buy again,Neutral
Everyone has their own tastes for perfume so reviews for scent are exceptionally subjective.  I like this perfume because I like soft sultry musky warm delicately sweet scents.  I dislike floral and scents that are overly sweet.Delicious Cotton Candy does smell like cotton candy but that is only the first note.  After that you detect warm vanilla and musk.  I would say this is musky like Euphoria or Princess (Vera Wang) but sweeter.  However the cotton candy scent is NOT as sweet as Pink Sugar.If you prefer cool fruity or floral you may not like this.  I love it.  It is a sexy sweet soft and warm smell.(Minus one star - it does not last long.  I get about four hours of scent.) Sweet musky soft warm.,Neutral
gave  stars cause of the packing process. the box was soaked the packing air was soaked the slip statement was soaked and the product itself all smelled just like POT! Not joking in any way.  It just blew in my face when I opened it. I smelled a little of it when I got near the box then when I opened it it was like a plume of stale pot air in my face. I am still trying to de-scent the bottle now and it has been  days. It is not the scent of the perfume it is from whoever was packing the product. I will never order from these people again if this is how they take care of their customers. I was at odds to figure out if I should request a refund send it back or try to keep it. I have yet to go near it. I have such a sensitive nose asthma and I can't stand the smell! They should know better! Poor responsibility execution  and respect of property of their customers.,Neutral
This perfume doesn't really smell so bad but it's got so much musk in it that it literally chokes me to death!  My husband likes it but I hate it so much that I can't even wear it for him.  I've never purchased a perfume in my life that I couldn't wear.  Usually I can take them or leave them but this one is just nasty.  If you love musk you'll love it and if you hate musk you'll hate it.  I've tried Pink Sugar too and it was way better but still not what I was looking for.  There's an odd smell to it that I don't care for either (like a hint of a burnt smell or something) but it's ok and I can wear it.  My favorite is Fancy by Jessica Simpson.  I know I wish someone else made it... anyone else lol but it has a light not too sweet/candy/girlish scent of cotton candy and vanilla.  It's by far my favorite perfume along with a few others I'll list below.  The only downside to it is that it doesn't last as long as I think it should but I get a ton of compliments on it every time I wear it!  Especially when I use Victoria's Secret Candy Baby body spray underneath.  Other scents I like are:  VS Candy Baby Lucky You Versace Red Jeans Candies (yellow and orange) Gap Dream Halle Berry (purple pure orchid I think but it doesn't smell flowery... it has a little bit of a fresh fruity smell) Euphoria CK Intimately Beckham.Euphoria and IB are my least faves of the whole list... and the list pretty much goes in order from fave to least fave though I might flip Halle and Gap Dream.  I got IB bc it was supposed to have a cotton candy/vanilla smell.  It smells good but it's got this note in it somewhere that reminds of me of horrid old women's perfume and I can't shake it.  I can wear it and it really does smell good and last a long time but that one note turns me off just enough that I won't buy it anymore.  Euphoria was given to me and it like it pretty ok.  Smells better in the air than on the skin for me but still a keeper.CB LY RJ smell kind of sweet and candyish.  LY and RJ smell a little more like an adult woman's perfume but not old.  Just right.  Candies is a sweetish citrus that I love Gap Dream has kind of a grape/fruity smell as does Halle Berry but Halle Berry is better quality and smells less teenager-y.  As you can tell I like citrus sweet/vanilla and fruit smells.  I HATE musk and flowery smells.  Hope this helps someone!  :)  HeatherHeather UpChurchArt & Design Studios[...][...] Blech... too much musk!,little bit
My husband loves this fragrance so much. We relocated due to work and could not find it. Amazon has the best price and the perfume is the real thing. It is addictive. It is sophisticated and very playful at the same time. It is a high quality fragrance and you do not have to reapply it. It reminds me of my BVL  but it is so much better and lasts for days. BVL doesn't. When you wear this men are crazy about this fragrance. It has chocolate and then vanilla and then the middle notes are like pink jasmine maybe a little ylang ylang and the base smells of sandalwood but what I love is during the dry down you never lose any of the top or middle notes. Your clothes and bed linens pick up the scent because of the oils even thought this is an EDT it is like a perfume. This isn't a little girls scent nor an old lady's scent but like I said men love it and women ask what it is. I won't tell though. I have BVL  but it has nothing on Cotton Candy so yes I recommend it. Better than Bvlgari...,Neutral
love this.  also love the bottle it is just wonderful.  I have a collection of perfume and this just added to it delicious cotton candy,Neutral
I purchased this perfume in high hopes that it smells like cotton candy based on customer reviews.But it doesn't smell like cotton candy to me at all. But my daughter likes it so I gave it to her.I like Body Fantasy Cotton candy now that smells just like Cotton candy and its way cheaper than this.Sorry... I dont think so...,Neutral
I love this perfume. I have bought so many brands of perfume and for the price ;this has to be the best. It smells like candy- but how a women would want to smells  not a child. Every time I wear this perfume everyone asks me; what I have on?( I just love it! )If you love Prada or Hard candy you will love this...I love you Gale Hayman.... Yummy! that is all I can say.  stars !!!!! I fell in love,Neutral
I love this scent. I have every cotton candy pink sugar scent and was so excited to see the Goddess of beauty still rolling out products! Gale Hayman is one of the original beauty queens of Beverly Hills so I knew it was going to be good. I have never seen this item anywhere. It smells fantastic and the bottle looks tres chic on my perfume stand. If you like pink sugar you will love this Just like my favorite Sugar scents but with cooler packaging,Neutral
No other way to leave this comment for others to know so I'm leaving it here.  Did you know that if you purchase a perfume/cologne from Amazon... even under &#;Prime&#; that if it leaks is broken etc... you can NOT return it because it is considered hazardous/flamable?????  Wish I had known this before as this arrived leaking all over the box and now I'm just going to have to toss it in the trash and be out the money I spent for it. Non-Returnable,Neutral
The yucky scent is coming from the cap not the perfume. Throw the cap away and the problem is solved. That being said the perfume itself is just so-so. It's a sweet mild scent... pretty but no staying power. If you want something simple and light (maybe for a kid) this will do the job. If you want something more complex and with better staying powder go for Pink Sugar instead. Toss the Cap!,Neutral
I luv the smell of cotton candy so I purchased this perfume. The smell is amazing but it doesn't last long at all. I give this perfume three stars out of  because of that reason Perfume smells amazing,Neutral
I have bad allergies so there are only a few perfumes that I can wear this is by far my favorite. Also because I work in a medical practice I can only wear something soft and not loud. So if you are looking for something soft and not over powering this is it. Wonderful,Neutral
This perfume smells so great & long lasting. One of the best perfumes I purchased buy it & you won't regret it. I really love this scent. Awesome,Neutral
When I look at reviews I look for someone to tell what the perfume smells like!  I don't care how much you like the perfume or hate it TELL ME WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE!  So here is my best description: Fruity and Nutty with a beautiful hint of sweet cream mixed in!  This is along the lines of todays type of perfumes where chocolates and creams are all the rage.  This is a nice mellow perfume for the young at heart! Fruity and Nutty smelling.,Neutral
This is an amazing scent I have to agree with another reviewer it's hard to describe a perfume but it is a perfect balance of fruity and nutty scents but I smell hints of a powdery scent. It's not overpowering and I think that has to do with the powdery scent too it's subtle yet delicious. In the elevator a man asked me what I was wearing and he said he'll have to buy some for his wife. I simply adore this scent.Update //This is my second purchase of Guess by Marciano and this morning in the elevator and a man said he really loved the scent of my perfume. I don't know what it is but this scent really gets a man's attention. This scent will always have a place in my fragrance arsenal. Seductively intoxicating scent,Neutral
The scent of this perfume is great. Very sweet almost like candy! It's light enough to wear for daily events as well. I also really love the bottle and the design. Not a bad purchase! Wonderful scent!,Neutral
This is by far the best smelling perfume in the world!!!  I got a sample from a high-end store and fell in love with it immediately.  As a matter of fact when my daughter was visiting from Chicago she took it from me and said she liked it better than a much more expensive perfume that she had at home. Ed Hardy Perfume for Women,Neutral
I bought this perfume for my daughter on her birthday. She was using the fake imitation brands for many years. I decided to buy her the original fragrance. The case and the bottle are very nice. The price was reasonable and lower than at the stores. The original scent is so fruity and refreshing. My daughter loves it. I would definitely recommend it to other females.... The real deal,Neutral
My daughter absolutely loves this perfume.  Sometimes she goes a little crazy when spraying it all the time but she likes it a lot. Daughter loves this,Neutral
I'm so excited about my Ed Hardy perfume! I was worried about ordering online but everything was new and in original packaging. I'm very pleased with this purchase because I couldn't find this good of a deal in stores and this is one of my favorite perfumes. Ed Hardy Perfume,Neutral
I bought the gift set of this perfume last week and it quickly became one of my new favorite scents.I like perfumes with a slight musk or woodsy smell and usually prefer fruity to floral.This perfume is just that! Not too girly but has a touch of sweetnessunlike any of my other scents.It also lasts all day and I have received many compliments!If you are looking to try a new perfume I definately reccomend this! one of my new favorites!,Neutral
My sisters a big fan of this perfume so I decided to buy it for her of course she loves it. Its a pretty big size for the price and its beautifully made! My sister loves it,Neutral
I love ed hardy perfumes they all smell so good and this one is no exception! It is big and a good price you definately can't go wrong! Ed hardy :),Neutral
I thought it was the real deal and UPON opening the bottle Could tell at first glace that it is a KNOCK OFF!! No designer signature and missing labels. AND to make it WORST it doesn't small like the real thing. I been wearing this perfume for years I know my Ed Hardy.... and it smells like a cheap family dollar perfume mostly alcohol and water. I feel Like a fool.,Neutral
This is greasy thick and doesn't leave my hair soft.  It just defines curls.  It smells GREEAT! I can't lie about that and that's the only reason why I would buy it again.  It's worth the perfume.  I use it rarely just to give me a smell.  This product was so beefed up after I heard so much about it but it's not a moisturizer.  certainly not a daily moisturizers.  Wanna do twists to get curls in the morning? buy this. wanna get a jell-like obedience to your hair? buy this.  wanna smell GREAT? buy this! What's the big deal?,Neutral
i came across this soap as an add on.  I'm glad I found it.  I feel more freshend when I use it in the shower.  I first use my body wash then this bar soap on the wash cloth and rub the cloth on my body.  I feel fresher and actually get many compliments on my perfumes and I believe it's because this keeps the bacteria off my skin so my perfume does smell better.  i'll continue to use it.  I have also noticed a difference with my feet as well.  I wear sandals all the time and I no longer smell the feety odor.  If your outdoors a lot or just sweat a lot in general then this is the soap for you. great soap,Neutral
We have used this for many years as our hand-washing soap as well as for showering and have even bought it in the -gallon size.  That should indicate how confident and pleased we are with the product.  We love the lack of all sorts of additives perfumes etc.  This is just for what it's designed to do - wash bodies - with no frills (and by &#;frills&#; I mean unnecessary things such as fragrances that trigger allergic-type responses etc.).  This is the best we've found and we've stuck with it for many many years. Tops in its product category!,Neutral
I'm a person who does a fair amount outside and a fair amount with his hands.  As a person who cares for horses (and cats and dogs and chickens and finches and a guinea fowl) I must wash my hands often then go back outside--frequently in cold weather using rope or hay or hammers or wood or any other surfaces that share roughness with drying and chapping and well you name it.In cold weather particularly my hands fall victim frequently to really painful cracks at the ends of my fingers.  Should I have to handle a semi delicate fabric--say doing laundry or hugging my wife or children--and my hands frequently act like a really grabby sandpaper.  And my children and wife are constantly asking me to do something about my super dry and crack-y (and painful) skin.So I got this.  It's not perfume-y not greasy and goes on easily and socks in very quickly.  I'm very pleased with how it makes me feel too: I don't have to wait long before I can use my hands again and I don't go around leaving a residue on anything I touch afterward.And it really does a very nice job on my hands...I have had a lot smoother skin--I feel it myself and my wife and kids tell me all the time.  I'm very pleased with Gold Bond--I've loved their powder for years.  It really is the &#;Ultimate&#; skin healing lotion. Great for Men,Neutral
This lotion smells so good that I don't have to use body sprays. I get headaches from perfume so I've always had to use body sprays so this isn't TOOO strong of a smell but good enough :-) I did not notice any shimmer until I got out in the sunlight there is a slight shimmer to this but that's fine with me not noticeable indoors. As far as firming I really don't know if its done that but its a good daily lotions keeps my skin soft. Love this lotion!,Neutral
I'm pretty young but I'm all about prevention at this age.  I figured the things I do now will affect me in the decades to come.  I also live in a dry climate so my skin suffers from cold and harsh conditions during the winter.  I thought firming would be great since my skin micro-wrinkles when the weather gets bad.PROS:- comes in big bottles so lasts a while- average moisturing like normal lotion- Olay brand so great on sensitive skin like mine- contains reflective particles (very slight metallic shimmer on skin)CONS:- not exactly firming...I think it just leaves particles on TOP of your skin that dries and fills in the micro-wrinkles- strong perfume smell which I'm not terribly fond on- burns a little on sunburns sensitive skin or when my face has wind burns- a little pricey- the &#;quenching&#; part isn't good enough for dry climates better for more humid climates- doesn't absorb easily (gotta really rub it in)OVERALL:I like it but I don't think I'll buy it again.  If you live in dry climates or have wrinkles I would suggest Jergen's Unscented body lotion.  That stuff is extremely extremely moisturizing and the only thing that saves me during the winter months.  It absorbs into your skin and lasts all day.  But...for that reason don't put it on your face or you'll get acne.I like the shimmer my skin has and I love Olay products but this one is just your average lotion with the &#;firming&#; as an afterthought. Not exactly firming but nice!,sensitive skin
i have tried several self tanners... and i have to admit for price convenience and effect- this is #.. all self tanners have a self tanny smell...some are more faint than others and some use more perfumes to mask it than others- this one really is not bad at all.. i am naturally dark olive (asian skin).  so i tan brown- not gold.  this matches perfectly.. i use this after i shower MIXED with a regular body lotion.  i have found that if i dilute the tanner with body lotion- it soaks in better and there are never any blotches or streaks- even on knees and elbows.. best way to look naturally tan not be that smelly girl with blotchy ankles and fingers and give melanoma the finger. best one.,Neutral
This is an odd product. What attracted me was the fragrance free part. Surprise they do add color to it so it is not completely free of all artificial stuff it has a dye in it. It does smell funny. I wish they had used a more refined cocoa butter. Other than the smell it works great absorbs quickly and will no set off my migraines because of perfume. For that I am very happy. Smells funny but works,Neutral
This is one of the most effective hand creams I have found. I'm a professional landscaper and my hands get thrashed. But nobody knows that because each night I exfoliate and moisturize heavily so that I can still have nice hands.This is a wonderful cream because it sinks in doesn't sting cracked skin and really provides long-lasting protection and healing. One tube lasts forever in fact I usually get the gift set of small tubes of L'Occitane hand creams just for some variety and I find that the three small tubes easily last me the year.The two things I dislike are the scent which smells a bit like old-lady cold cream - not unpleasant but a bit more perfumey than I like and the cap which is fiddly and hard to get back on once you've moisturized your hands.Other than that this is a highly effective cream that works great for healing hands that have been in the dirt. Cream works great on gardener's hands but smell is a bit commercial for me,Neutral
At times I travel for business in warmer climates and often business meals and meetings take place outdoors.  I'll fly to Miami for a day or two and if I don't use a sunscreen my face will get that reddish appearance (not a healthy tan a reddish appearance).  For these times I need some protection that is as neutral in application and appearance as possible.  I like the Cetaphil moisturizer as a daily use product in such circumstances as it is not greasy at all and offers protection for my face.Regarding fragrance-free:  although I don't think there are any perfumes in the product it still does have a slight fragrance (which I notice) although much less than a typical sunscreen. A Good Daily Use Sunscreen,Neutral
There are five different sunscreens in this product.  Five!  So far it works better than anything I've tried for blocking the sun.The product is thick in texture but still somewhat runny very white and a bit greasy-feeling (despite what the label says).  Very little odor and certainly  no perfumes. While the packaging implies that you could use this as regular moisturizer on your face I would not recommend it.  It left me very shiny and seems to highlight even small wrinkles.However for just an outing in the sun?  Fabulous.  I've used it during my hour-long runs in bright sunlight.  It protects well and despite not having any sport designation it doesn't seem to easily wear off from perspiration.  It's very gentle on my skin too. The next step up protection is aluminum foil,Neutral
This is good stuff.  It's SPF  and does a good job protecting the skin from the sun.  Unlike many other sun protectors that keep off that much sun this isn't thick and pasty.  It goes on smooth and moisturizes the skin almost like standard Cetaphil lotions.  It is a bit more greasy and leaves a bit more residue on the face than standard moisturizer - but that is to be expected since it is needs to leave some kind of layer on the skin in order to protect.  It has a very light fragrance but doesn't smell like perfume.  It works just fine for what it's supposed to do.  I'm happy with it. Goes on smooth keeps the burn off,Neutral
We live above  ft in altitude where there is a lot more solar radiation and thus I wear and make my kids wear sunscreen outdoors year round.Here are our thoughts:The good:* Excellent SPF protection* Did not cause allergic reaction in daughter with very sensitive skin.* A dab covers a fair amount of skin.* No perfume type smell for males to object to.The bad:* You have to rub a bit to get the white from the titanium dioxide to rub in.* Too heavy to wear just as a moisturizer.* It does have a light smell (typical sunscreen smell) even though is fragrance freeThe ugly:* Way too expensive to use everyday.  With product this costly one is tempted to try tospread it too thin  it then has lower SPF.I am only giving it  stars because I think it is an average sunscreen at a premium price.I use lots of Cetaphil products which I adore but the cost of this is just too high. Average sunscreen at a premium price.  But was non allergenic for very sensitive skin.,sensitive skin
My daughter (teen) and I really like this lotion. It has a nice vanilla-y smell and after you put it on the fragrance sticks around.Although you can definitely smell it it's not so strong that you'll knock someone out in the elevator. Just a hint of scent. Enough though that you might not want to mix the perfume of this lotion with another perfume. ((note: if you are sensitive to fragrances pick another lotion. This Suave product has a long lasting scent that is stronger than any other Suave product I've tried.))LIGHT WeightI have all kinds of lotion for a variety of conditions. They are all needed. This Suave Naturals lotion is on the light weight side of the scale. Perfect for summer when the winter elements aren't stripping away your body oils leaving you with chapped skin.  It leaves my mom skin moisturized and soft.Nice choice if you are looking for a light moisturizing lotion that has a pleasant vanilla-lavender perfume. Lavender Vanilla!,Neutral
This is so fresh and simple two ingredients. I use it to spray in my hair and as a light perfume that won't make all the people around me gag. Fresh and Simple,Neutral
I love this for toning my skin-my grandmother swore by rosewater. I use them after a bath and in the clothes dryer as well.However I've also used this for years for grandkid sleepovers. I altered the label to read Happy Dream Magic Spray. All you need is a little puff dramatically sprayed into a dark corner or under the bed. Oh! Look! It's working already!!! No more bad dreams or scary things! I only use Cayce waters as they are not a perfume but a pure floral infusion.Lasts a long time and the placebo effect plus the calming florals work like a charm. Happy Dream Magic Spray,long time
[...]Heritage Store Rosewater & Glycerin spray is like magic! For the price you cannot do better. Its a great moisturizer refresher skin astringent emollient body spray or perfume. Glycerin and rosewater have been valuable skin ingredients to women for centuries. This combination of rosewater AND glycerin is also used in various cosmetic lotions and creams. It is supposed to conduce  glowing and soft skin. Rosewater has anti-inflammatory astringent and antiseptic properties making it great for facial cleansing and toning. Glycerin on its own is a wonderful oil-free moisturizer and rosewater has skin nourishing properties. What's great about this spray versus other rosewater sprays is that it combines both into one (not to mention how great the price is).I picked up this brand in a small whole foods store on a small street in Kauai in Hawaii over this past holiday season while on vacation and I was instantly impressed. It is now one of my must have products. Then I realized I can easily order it on Amazon for just about $-$ a bottle.I have tried many grades and many price levels of rose spray and rose oils (I do love REN rose oil but it is pricey and I usually only use it in the winter and not everyday). This spray is the best there is for the price in my opinion. While I am a fan of Mario Badescu's rosewater facial spray since I have tried this one I don't think I will go back to Mario's. Mario's spray is a little milder and not as moisturizing. It is also doesn't contain glycerin. So if you have very oily skin you may prefer Mario's version.I suggest spraying this on your  face and body when you get out of the shower and then applying your moisturizer. The rosewater and glycerin will add extra hydration and you will love the scent.[...] Amazing spray amazing result amazing price,Neutral
I was sceptical about this product when I first got it but it turns out to work really well for me. I find it works best when my face is still damp. It smells nice not heavily perfumed. I have the smaller size and it will travel well. Its summer now but I can imagine it being handy in the harsh winter cold. a pritz of moisture to combat dry winter skin!! Supple Skin,Neutral
I bought this product to use when making my own perfume using oils.  This blends well without changing the scent of your oils and is an extender. Great product to use when preparing your own perfumes,great product
I like my perfumes not strong announcing themselves but at the same time I don't want it to disappear by pm. The cologne is okay nice smell but way too lite. After pm forget it you can't smell it. Even when I used it in the night before sleeping by the time I wake in the morning its gone and even my PJs have no trace of it. Okay but way too lite,Neutral
This is a lovely light perfume that smells fantastic. I love this particular brand because the sent of the perfume reacts to the oils within your skin as well as the air around you which makes the smell different every time. Being that it is not too heavy it's more so a bit lighter and airy; like the sea in a way I wear it to work and get a lot of compliments. In all honesty this would make a fantastic gift for a friend or two or better yet if you want to use it yourself it's highly recommended. Fantasti,Neutral
Great fragrance going on but after a couple of hours I was left with a really sweet perfumey powdery smell and had to wash it off. Not one of my favorite colognes. It might be a good buy for others with different body chemistry--but for me it did not work. So-so,Neutral
I love colognes but I am very selective. I tend to avoid colognes with powerful scents because I prefer more of a subtle and summery smell rather than a strong scent that makes a statement when your in a crowd. I actually got this item as a gift and did not know what to expect. I was aware that Versace is a very well known company and held very high by many including my father so I had very high hopes for it. My father worked in the perfume/cologne business his whole life and he informed me that this cologne is made from high quality materials. When I first used it I did not know what to expect. To my surprise it was very subtle fresh and clean but it smelled wonderful. It has a very unique smell kind of fruity but perfect for men. Despite my horrible description of the scent I can assure you that the smell is amazing. The duration of the cologne is amazing. I can put on two sprays worth in the morning and it will last throughout he whole day and on to the next. My girlfriend absolutely adores it when I wear this cologne and I have received multiple compliments while wearing this cologne. It might be a little on the expensive side but at the end of the day this product is worth every penny.Hopefully I helped make your decision easier! Write to me if you have any comments or question thanks for reading! Delightful,Neutral
I use Cetaphil cleanser and thought this bar would be easier to deal with. Instead it's the most atrocious smelling over-fragranced product I've ever had the displeasure to purchase. Cetaphil is known for being free of harsh detergents. It would be nice if it was also free of harsh scents. If you thought Irish Spring was over the top.... this soap smells like vinyl mixed with Grandma's perfume. It will make you wince from three feet away. NOT for guys.It's also available for a tenth of this figure elsewhere (google it). Atrocious fragrance,Neutral
This cream is worth every penny! I am overjoyed to finally find a COMPLETELY pure body cream and organic too! So wonderful! I wish I could give this product more than five stars! It says lotion but it is thick and rich like a cream and smells fantastic; very natural coconut smell. I love it! I have sensitive skin made even more sensitive by my overuse of popular heavily perfumed body products.  I have worked for years for a national beauty store that specializes in creams and body products.  Recently their products started giving my skin blisters and blemishes.  My skin felt dry and was peeling about thirty minutes after using their best cream; which after reading is loaded with multiple types of parabens and chemicals-yuk. Why are we still putting these nasty things all over our bodies when parabens have been linked directly to an increase in breast cancers? I wish I had changed my habits years ago! If you don't want to make a change for yourself then make it for your little ones.  My little ones now use only this lotion and a pure body wash.  My daughter used to complain that her skin was itchy after using other brands of body lotions (the ones loaded with chemicals).  After using this lotion there have been NO complaints! She even loves the scent and she is super picky.  All in all a FANTASTIC product! Absolutely fantastic!,sensitive skin
Growing up in Europe I used to see my parents using Nivea creams a lot. As an adult it took me a while to go back to that brand maybe because the association with my parents made me consider Nivea too old fashioned? Shame on me. This is hands down the BEST body lotion I have been able to find in both supermarkets as well as department stores:PROS:- smooth texture: comes out of the pump easily rubbs on body easily and evenly;- fast absorption: you can almost watch it soak into your skin leaving NO film residue behind;- non-greasy quality: makes your skin dewey but not oily; your clothes and stockings are safe; I put it on directly after a shower/bath (when my skin is still slightly damp) and then let my body air dry while I progress with my morning routine; within minutes it is safe to put your clothes on;- superb moisturization quality: no ashy flakes in sight! leaves skin plump!- boutique scent: it is sofisticated clean and barely there...will not overpower your perfume;- price: I found the  ml size for about  bucks; CANNOT beat that!- bottle with a pump: makes it easier to use when your hands are wet; can be locked for travel;CONS:- Though I love the pump it is clearly too short to get all the lotion out. I HATE when manufacturers do that (I would take away half a star for that if I could). And so I end up cutting the bottle in half to get the last bit out...Enjoy! Best body lotion E*V*E*R*!,Neutral
So I have a Nivea bathing ritual. I use the touch of renewal scrub and I vary from touch of harmony or original creme moisture body wash. The second one being my favorite. The original scent is amazing I personally enjoy and blends well with my perfume. The original moisture lotion absorbs quickly and is not greasy. The greasy nivea lotion is the enriched one I back away from that one.  My skin is always glowing and looking healthy. No complaints at all. There are more advanced Lotions out there now but nivea and jergens classic  remain on the market because they are still favorites Nivea has my skin looking amazing,Neutral
First Dove was always in the house growing up (after it arrived on the market) as my mom always used it and swore by it. I used it fairly infrequently because of its softness and its scent favoring Lifebouy because it was not a flowery one even though it had a heavy scent itself.I came to dislike any scent in many things and generally chose spicy woodsy or the more medicinal scented items rather than sweet or flowery.Now in my advanced years I guess I have arrived at a place where I appreciate Dove's effect on my facial area and neck etc. My skin has now become quite a bit dryer than when I was younger and I find that this bar does well by my skin adding a better quality to my now &#;wrinkly&#; and &#;lined&#; areas and making my face feel more like it &#;fits better to my substrate&#; (grin).Bathing or showering with it though for me remains as I felt about it years ago. I never felt completely &#;rinsed off&#; after using it when young and still find that it (for me) retains this quality as I had remembered it.Lastly concerning this soap the subject of scent would naturally have to come up as an issue for a guy like myself &#;a man of no scents&#; who has avoided most everything scented my whole adult life. The scent here is what I would describe as &#;most overpowering&#; but that is me and everybody is different and most do like some perfumed quality present in their soap(s).Summing up I understand this product's popularity with the masses. It does do what it claims to do...hands down. I would certainly use it facially etc. as I said.  For bathing or showering not so enthusiastically however. The scent if anything for me would be &#;the kicker&#; as I mentioned above.~operabruin  Stars for Facial Use  for Body  for Scent,Neutral
AS far as I can tell this original Dove soap...er I mean Beauty Bar...has not changed in years.  That is not necessarily a bad thing when so many products tout &#;new and improved&#; yet are anything but improved.Dove is reliable and consistent.  Dove is affordable.  It's gentle has a pleasant smell that is instantly recognizable but not perfumey.  With the exception of the handmade natural oils luxury soaps I love this seems to be one of the best bars out there.  I love the way it makes my skin feel nice and soft after using not at all tight or dry feeling.One caveat -- because this has so much moisturizer in it it does melt away quickly.  If needs to be kept where it will be dry when not in use where it doesn't sit in a puddle of water.  Otherwise it will just melt away leaving a mess.This is a great everyday product. Not New and Improved,Neutral
I have very sensitive skin and it seems no matter what soap I use it tends to itch if I use it too often or don't rinse well enough.  That's as true of this Dove as the other soaps I've tried in the past though this bar was less irritating than a lot of them.  Overall it's a fine soap though we went through it very quickly compared with other soaps in the past and I can't give this one to my kids to use. This bar gets extraordinarily slippery and we lost about half a bar's worth in the tub before we realized it.Still this is probably one of the nicer bar soaps out there and it doesn't have an overwhelming scent which is a plus.  I tend to get headaches from soap scents and perfumes so I prefer something that helps me come out smelling clean rather than flowery.Overall I'd probably recommend it unless you have some severe sensitive skin issues.Happy Bathing! ^_^ Shanshad Fine for Soap But Still a bit Itchy,sensitive skin
First the good news:  It goes on well with minimal greasiness and it sinks in quickly.  Actually I like the texture quite well.But the smell. . .I don't know what it's supposed to smell like but it smells to me like really really cheap lemon perfume.  Like not like a ammonia exactly but. .just very chemical.  The smell fades fast enough though so if you really just have to have an organic body lotion this will do. . .but there's got to be better-smelling options out there. Not a particularly attractive smell,Neutral
I would give this product  stars if it used organic lotion. Works well handy for travel but some of us are sensitive to chemical perfumes and prefer to use our own brand of lotion. Needs Organic Lotion,Neutral
I picked up the Venus Breeze rather hoping to liberate my Mach .  Sadly this won't be my final salvation.  Although my wife reports it is alright it just doesn't compare to the higher-end precision disposables.And guys - no it isn't at all good for your beard.  It will hack your neck apart while leaving it smelling of flowers and cheap perfume. (What?  You didn't think I'd write a review without giving the product a good going-over did you?) Wife still using my Mach's,Neutral
I have probably used every body wash for sale.  About once a month my husband collects the ton of bottles in the bath and asks me which ones should be recycled.  I've used body washes that leave my skin dry some that irritate others that leave me with an oil slick and a few that just plain stink.Olay has created a creamy moisturizing luscious body wash that leaves skin moisturized but not greasy.  The body wash has enough substance to stick to a washcloth/loofa yet it easily rinses off.  The scent is subtle and does not clash with perfumes etc.I espected to give this body wash a negative review because the last dozen washes I've tried cost a fortune and just didn't deliver.  But I'm buying more of this one! The Best!  And I'm Serious!,Neutral
I've tried several of the Olay body washes with moisturizing ribbons. They all make a thick rich foam and they make your skin feel SO good after showering. This one has a slightly different scent that reminds me of sweet coconut. It's just the right amount of fragrance. It's subtle and not too perfume-like. I love this stuff and highly recommend it.CONS: Only one. I've only twice SUSPECTED that I could see any shimmer on my skin and that was in direct sunlight. Maybe I'm spending too much time in the shower enjoying my soft skin after bathing? Maybe I'm toweling it off? I'll give Olay the benefit of the doubt on this one.  stars!***** EDIT: Only a day after posting this review I noticed sparkles on my legs. Each day as I've continued to use it I've noticed my skin shimmering in different spots. It's subdued but still enjoyable. I love this stuff. My skin feels great. HIGHLY recommend!

This Olay Bodywash is really nice.  I am pretty picky about the products I use and was very happy with this bodywash.  Here is my review rundown:Scent/smell:  mild almost buttery and slightly sweet...for female mostly some men may like it~ very pleasant~ does not interfere with my perfumeTexture:  creamy thick not greasy small latherResult:  softer skin moisturized better looking skin overall after a few days use not shimmeryClaim:  Product says it has tone enriching ribbons of moisture & mineral shimmerThe ribbon is the print on the outside it is actually just one thick soap/moisturizer that softens & moisturizes ~ it does!  As for the mineral shimmer it is ever so slight which I like--no obnoxious glitter.I wasn't expecting much but am very impressed with this soap. My skin feels so much better and much more moisturized stepping out of the shower.  I will surely continue to use this product!  Happy bathing!  :) Skin is So Soft and Lovely very nice product~~~,Neutral
This product works for me. Did not smell a whole lot of perfume gave a bit of tone to skin. There was lot of lather made with just small amount of the bodywash. The skin was left moist and soft.Overall good product but I would prefer Dove bodywashes over it. Good Lather Not too much smell bit of tone,Neutral
PROS:The body wash works nicely with sponges washcloths and poufs.The soap is rich thick creamy and very concentrate. This bottle goes a long way.The cream soap leaves the skin moisturized like a light lotion with a hint of glimmer.The skin texture improves slighly with repeated uses like a mild exfoliant.The container is attractive and dispenses easily.The fragrance is pleasant if you like coconut. Not perfumey.CONS:The price isn't horrible but it's certainly more expensive than soap.The glimmer is very subtle. If you want an obvious shimmer buy a shimmer lotion that stays on your body. Most of this rinses off with the soap.The ingredients are a huge list of chemicals including petroleum and mineral oil which are known to be oxiding and ages the skin.There are lots of other chemicals included here. Not necessarily stuff you want on your skin (modern science tells us that what goes on the skin eventually enters the blood stream through absorption).Overall I wouldn't have spent money on it. I liked the creaminess and the fragrance which is a nice change from bar soap but wasn't knocked out by the effect I got from it.If you're looking for tone and shimmer that is pronounced try Aveeno's line of lotions for exfoliating and glow or use a self tanner with bronzing effect.  What you get from this is minimal. Good but not outstandingly different.,Neutral
Olay have always put out products designed to enhance your skins moisture as well as provide a soft gentle scent.  This product is no different.  Body washes are the best alternative to a bar of soap there is.  Olay Bodywash goes on smooth and lathers very well and provides a clean feeling at the end of the shower or bath.  Your skin is left smooth and hydrated.  Unlike soap.The scent of this bodywash is almost like a powder.  So it doesn't have a strong perfume smell.  You smell clean without overpowering any fragerance you put on such as perfume.Try this product for yourself to see how clean and refreshing your shower experience can be. Clean and refreshing,Neutral
Firstly if you want mica in your moisturizing body wash this could be the one for you.  Secondly if you do please let me know why!  Honestly I'm truly curious.  It could be that I want it but don't know it yet.Perhaps that's what Olay says is going to transform my skin in  days.  (It says this in the Amazon product description but nowhere on the bottle I received.)I figure these mica minerals in the moisture + mineral shimmer ribbon could be there to help exfoliate and/or leave a sparkle behind on my skin.  For me if I want to exfoliate I'd prefer to use something with a larger particle (that I would notice if it were left behind somewhere it shouldn't be) or a dissolving scrub like sugar or salt.  I just don't like the idea of small particles being left behind and/or running down into certain mucous membrane areas below the waist.  Now if I wanted a shimmer on my skin (which I don't) I think I'd prefer to use an after-shower product that I can control more -- like a powder a lotion or a spray.  Unlike previous reviewers I don't notice any real glow or residual sparkle on my skin.  All I notice is the scent which is reminiscent of a high-end sunscreen -- with perfumey tropical notes of artificial coconut.  I still felt the need to use moisturizer after the shower but as body washes go this one *is* quite moisturizing.What this body wash *does* do well:+ -- it cleans well.  It lathers nicely and a little goes a long way.+ -- it seems quite moisturizing.  The texture is odd but I think that is due to the presence of significant moisturizing agents -- petrolatum and mineral oil are the second and third ingredients (the first being water).  In fact I'm impressed at how well it lathers given that ingredient profile.What's questionable:+/- -- the scent.  I personally don't like it -- it's too heady and too artificial for me.  Those who like the scent of artificial coconut in some suntan lotions might enjoy it however.What I don't like at all:- -- the mica minerals.  I see no noticeable benefit from them and worry about them being left on my skin or in certain ahem nether regions with mucous membrane surfaces.  I'd rather exfoliate with something else and I'm not sure the mica even does this anyway.  But please let me know if you can think of a good reason for these mica minerals.  Yes mica is a long-established ingredient of many makeups but I'd prefer to keep its application to my body restricted to precise areas.- As someone else mentioned it doesn't even pretend to be green.  The ingredients are a serious chemical alphabet soup.  The shortest one by far being mica with one of the longest being acrylonitrile/methacrylonitrile/methyl methacrylate copolymer.  Yum.I've never been one to turn down a free product really but I'm tempted to get rid of this.  (I received it via the Amazon Vine program.)  I think I may keep it to use as a foot wash only.  It does a great job of cleansing and moisturizing my feet.  Just watch out if you use it this way -- it's *very* slick; please be careful not to slip! If you want mica in your bodywash this could be for you,long way
With these kinds of products it's always a wise decision to approach with some caution. A lot of them use sometimes harsh chemicals to perform their work leaving the user red and sore.The Olay Anti-Aging Starter Protocol I'm very happy to say works exactly as advertised with no problems. For starters this is not a fragrance-heavy product like some I've tried in the past when putting up with a strong perfume is an overwhelming experience.Application is a delight because it's not heavy or greasy but a light and pleasing texture.How about the results? After almost a month of use I find my skin smoother and definitely firmer although I can't report on the wrinkle-smooth effects because (thankfully) I don't have any wrinkles. If it works as advertised and as it has so far I will definitely continue its use.Five well-deserved stars. It Works!,Neutral
I'm in my mid-'s have fine lines but no deep creases as of yet have some sun damage and tend toward large pores. I stopped using my usual skin treatment products other than cleanser and morning moisturizer to use the Olay Skin Rehab Kit. I followed the full regimen and have to say I don't see any improvement in the sun damage or to the texture of my skin. In fact I think it is worse. I was using good exfoliants (alpha and beta hydroxy products) and I can see that I have more clogged pores and dead skin on the surface after using the Definity kit than before.I really disliked the fragrance of the week one cream it smelled so strong and overly perfumed I was afraid to get too close to my husband after I'd applied it! The first two nights I had some stinging after I applied it. I also had some breakouts that week. I quite liked the scent of the week two cream. While using it my skin was a little flaky and red. The mask was awful. Cold ooky and unpleasant. I have no clue if the serum did anything but I wouldn't really want to use the mask again.I'd say this product is basically harmless but didn't do much for me and definitely didn't rehabilitate anything. A daily regimen of exfoliating products is probably going to be more effective than two weeks once a quarter. I also felt really guilty throwing away the big plastic tray the tubes came in. don't really see any difference,Neutral
My skin was in pretty good shape (thanks to Olay Pro-X!) already but this looked interesting.The kit is nice-looking comes in  little tubes in a stand with a mask clipped to the back.Each tube has more than enough moisturizer for your face neck and even your hands if you like.  Phase One is very lightweight non-greasy and pinkish-tan colored.  Mildly perfumed.  Phase Two is thicker and pearly white.  The mask is white felt soaked in a translucent goo.  All phases worked well for moisturizing though I found the mask a little inconvenient since it takes + minutes.  I'd rather use that in the daytime.Overall it was entertaining and certainly did no harm.  It's hard to test sun damage in early spring and I was using a superior product already so I didn't expect to see anything dramatic and I didn't.  My skin looked good though.My biggest complaint is that the rehab kit is very wasteful in that it produces a lot of plastic trash.  All the tubes and the big rack to hold them.  Still if you want to take a couple weeks to pamper yourself inexpensively and don't mind throwing out % of what you paid for this would be a good choice. Kind of fun,Neutral
The genuine Japanese Salux wash cloths are amazing. I don't know personally about the Chinese/other knock-offs but the reviews for those are bad. So really if you get one that rocks your world and lasts and lasts (I'm still using the one from  with not a sign of wear/tear) and makes so much lather you extend the life of your bottle of pricey hypoallergenic or costly perfumed shower gel than you got the real thing.These are long and they are rough-textured. I have sensitive skin prone to eczema and I was afraid to use it. But I find if I don't use overly hot water and don't scrub too long I'm fine. I do what a lot of sensitive skin folks do--I cream up forehead to toes as soon as I get out of the shower while skin is moist. With these towels I know I got the dead skin and dirt off and I can cream up with confidence.The trick with the towel is to wet it thoroughly BEFORE you squeeze on a dollop of your shower gel or rub your bar of soap on it --works best with liquid soap or gel just so you know. Then squish and mush it up in your hands. It will lather up like mad. Even gels that didn't lather up much in regular cloth towels for me they later up a lot with the Salux. Which is GREAT.Okay so then you keep the towel out of the strong water stream or the lather will rinse right off. That's one of the key things about the Salux. It rinses thoroughly FAST. No residue. So it stays fresh-smelling clean and keeps working just right.The only reason I'm ordering more is that I gave my back-up one to hubby to scrub his back--the Salux is long enough that you can open it up hold end to end and scrub your back. So I want two to have a back-up for him and for me. Or even to add to gift baskets. Cause really these things don't seem to wear out. Like I said  /  years and counting..still going strong.If you hate rough-textured stuff skip this. If you love how soft your skin feels and how unclogged your pores are after exfoliating this is a wonderful invention of a wash cloth. Try it. It's pretty cheap for its usefulness and durability. (Great for scrubbing rough elbows and soles of feet too after pumicing to help fully smooth out.) I keep one of those old-fashioned laundry clips I inherited from MIL (top is like the hangar hood and bottom is like those bag clips) and I keep mine hanging to dry in the shower off the towel rack that's in there. Dries fine.If you have Keratosis P on your upper arms (like I did) this baby took care of that. I have smooth arms now.In case you're confused about the numbers--  and such--my understanding from the official Salux site is that the number is for the color/packaging (how many and what colors) but that they are all the same size.Enjoy.NOTE: I ordered from DANIEL'S HOUSE on Jan  and got it fast and it's the REAL THING (at least judging from the packaging which is the same as my original order of SALUX from a Japanese market. I also felt it with my fingers and compared and it feels the same. HTH... Have used for two years and VERY happy: lathers like mad saves me gel/soap exfoliates!,sensitive skin
When I first sampled this fragrance I was disgusted. Upon application the scent is so overpowering to the point that it's revolting. However after  minutes or so everything levels out. The perfume is very unique with a blend of intoxicating black orchid sandalwood and musk. I've never smelled anything like it. To me it's a more masculine scent and women who don't like intense perfumes will absolutely hate it. I like it well enough but it's still a little too intense for me. Give it a chance,Neutral
It smelled good in the bottle. It smelled ok not great on me for like  minutes. Then it turned from fragrance to the scent of perspiration and the drydown later that night had me smelling like a stripper's crotch after a night of working (minus the cigarettes). The worst part was that I simply could not get rid of the scent it gets into EVERYTHING.This is why I am really cautious when choosing perfume. I always get burned. Sigh,Neutral
Shea Cashmere Hand Cream features African Shea Butter known for its excellent moisturizing as well as Mongolian Cashmere Extract which imparts a smooth silky feeling on skin. However after digging out my reading glasses I noted that these two ingredients were a ways down on the ingredients list.  This was a little bit disappointing as typically I'd hope for them to bit closer to the top meaning a higher concentration.On the positive side the scent of Shea Cashmere Hand Cream is very nice. In the tube it has a sweet vanilla scent but when applied to my hands it smells more rich and nutty. It's subtle and not too heavy a nice change from some of the more heavily scented Signature hand creams I'd been using. The scent does last for a few hours as well so it's a good choice for women who prefer to use scented hand creams over cologne or perfume.Shea Cashmere Hand Cream isn't as thick in consistency as the Signature line hand creams. This is not necessarily bad though as it makes it a bit easier to squeeze from the tube while still having a nice rich consistency that I look for in a hand cream. I often apply hand cream while I'm at a stop light while driving and the last thing I want is a runny hand lotion that gets all over the place.I also felt it absorbed a bit more quickly than the Signature hand creams as it takes very little effort to rub it in. Of course this is nice when I'm driving as it doesn't feel as sticky and I don't worry about my hands being slippery on the steering wheel.However the big issue is its lack of moisturizing. I look for hand creams to provide some long term moisturizing as well as healing of dryness and rough skin. While my skin is not super dry the harsh cold winters of Colorado can suck all the moisture out of my skin if I'm not careful and diligent about using a good hand cream. I felt that all Shea Cashmere Hand Cream really does is make my skin feel smoother. An hour after application my skin particularly around my knuckles felt as dry as ever. Clearly this is not a therapeutic or healing hand cream for those with dry to very dry skin.I won't be purchasing Shea Cashmere Hand Cream again. Despite its high price tag it's a below average product when it comes to healing and protecting my skin. While I love its scent I'd be better off with their Signature line hand creams.  stars only. Nice scent but doesn't moisturize well,little bit
This perfume is perfect--very fresh and clean smelling.  I don't like perfumes that are overly floral or chemical smelling.  This just gives you a lovely fresh smell (like other reviews have described it--fresh laundry or soap).  I highly recommend this.  I love all of the Clean perfumes but this is definitely my new favorite! Breath of fresh air!,Neutral
I love this scent. I also love that it last all day. When I think it's fadedpeople tell me how great I smell.  When I wear this perfume I receive so many compliments from both men and women. If I had to compare this to something I would say it smells like Downy fabric softener but better. The cost is not too bad either. Love it and will continue buying,Neutral
I'm VERY sensitive to scents. I like light clean scents not heavy florial or anything else this is the one and only perfume I can wear without getting a headache or sick of it.

I first smelled this lovely fragrance which was given as a sample in The Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia. At first I thought it was not going to be one I would enjoy but as the day wore on I found myself really enjoying the light scent very much. I have since purchased at least four bottles of the perfume and wear it all the time receiving many compliments every time. I have also introduced it by way of gifts to my girlfriends and they all like it as much as I do. Perfect light fragrance,Neutral
I have used and liked other Blum natural cleansing wipes. This  one is loaded with sickening perfume. They don't mention this in the ingredient list. I had to wash my face after using one because the odor was so overwhelming but the smell was still apparent. I don't think this is just a plant based scent as they claim. It  smells more like a chemical additive like parfume. But if it is truly plant based they went waaaaay overboard. On the Pro side all the Blum wipes I've used do clean well and are a convenient alternative to remove make up. I had to return it,Neutral

I really don't see why people like this particular fragrance so much. It's just your typical perfume smell. In my opinion there are much better floral scents out there such as Enchanted Orchid. Don't See The Appeal,Neutral
I have to admit when it comes to lotions my purchases are really influenced by the smell. Luckily Bath and Body Works' lotions are very rich (and this one is no different) so your skin is receiving the moisture it deserves while you get to enjoy the luxurious scent.This scent smells light and fruity with almost a perfume-ish smell. Very intoxicating!I love this lotion and highly recommend it for girly girls like myself. Great Lotion -- pretty smell too!,Neutral
I am fourteen years old and my mother had brought this scent for me for Christmas. I used it in the shower and...WOO!..this scent is waayyy too strong for a teen! Even my mom told me when I walked out what's that perfume that you have on? Whatever it is..it smells too strongI am not saying that Cherry Blossom is bad...I am just saying that it's not the right smell for me! If you do not like heavy flowery floral smells then this is not the shower gel for you! In my opinion this does not even smell like a cherry blossom...it smells like a bunch of florals thrown together.Shower Gels and Scents that I would recommend:* American Beauty By Beloved* Be Enchanted (Bath and Body Works)* White Citrus (Bath and Body Works)* Perlier Snowdrop (my favorite &lt; )* YOUTH-DEW by Estee lauder* Sweet Honesty (Avon) Too Strong scented!!,Neutral
My daughter and I both love this hand cream.  Doesn't leave your hands slick and has a very pleasant and not perfumed aroma.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone. Excellent hand cream,Neutral
The cream itself is very rich and wonderful feeling. Unfortunately the fragrance is beyond overpowering. I'm not talking about a little goes a long way amount either. I'm talking about a fragrance so strong it completely assaults and overwhelms your senses (and everyone else's in the room theater etc). I got a headache from it within a couple minutes and ended up feeling the need to wash it off because it was so strong. Wayyy too potent a fragrance even for a highly perfumed cream in my opinion. Good Quality Cream - Overpowering Fragrance,Neutral
I LOVED the perfume in the product as far as the smell.  And it does fade quickly for those that don't like the smell.  But I wasn't buying perfume and I'm not a fan of putting perfume on my face.  And since I learned that perfumed products don't have to list the ingredients I'm steering away from fragranced products altogether whenever I can.  I just jumped on this because of the black seed oil ingredient and the good price.  But I will use it as a hand cream until it is gone and not purchase it again.  I just went through a month of looking for products with favorite ingredients when I should have just bought the extracts and added them to products I already have. duh. like the perfume but not on my face,Neutral
Basic is what used to be 'Pure & Natural'.Many many years ago I developed a mild allergy to perfumes and fragrances - long story. Ever since I had to say goodbye to all of them wonderful moisturizing deodorant skin-conditioning lathery soaps. It's been Pure & Natural or Basic for me when it comes to soap and unscented baby powder when it comes to deodorants. I occasionally use Johnson & Johnson bars but they tend to be a bit more expensive. And you know what? I feel much cleaner more comfortable fresher than 'before' Basic and after more than  years of daily and almost-exclusive use I am unaware of any unwanted side-effects.What you get with Basic is an honest inexpensive soap that keeps your skin honestly clean and healthy. Or so is my experience.Piece of advice - I'd check with my local supermarket before placing an order here. Hopefully one day this item will be available under the super-saver program. One of the very few soap brands that I can use (Pure & Natural  renamed),Neutral
This is a great soap.  It doesn't make you itch and isn't perfumed. There is a very slight scent but it is a soap scent not perfume and goes away while you're rinsing.  It's very gentle suds up well rinses off well and leaves your skin feeling good.  (If you want to wear some perfume it doesn't have to battle with your soap!)  If you can't find it in a store you can order it on-line.I am very allergic to most soaps breaking out in a rash so I was thrilled to find the Dial Basics.I highly recommend it. Dial Basics Hypoallergenic Bar Soap,Neutral
We have used Dial soap for more years than I want to admit but in the last few years the antibiotic variety coupled with the hard water in our new house was drying and seemed harsh. This bar is perfect without too much in the way of chemicals. Nice fragrance of clean soap without perfume. It rinses well in the hardest water. great for people with allergies,Neutral
I purchased this because I wanted to try something new but didn't want to break the bank in the process.  I'm currently in the middle east (Iraq) and there are plenty of perfume places out here but they wear off quickly and are seriously diluted with who-knows-what?  This stuff is amazing and I'm so shocked at how cheap it is for what you get!  I'm honestly surprised that it isn't flying off the shelves...well maybe it is I have sort of been out of the loop for awhile  lol.  But the scent is really good and I'm forever getting compliments on it. The bottle is really cute as well (think chanel no  style with a little bling) and the packaging is also nothing to laugh at it comes in an adorable little pinkish/purple box.Now for the good part:  this stuff smells like a very expensive fun playful scent...wonderful!  It is sort of floral with a little bit of sweet in there perfect for literally any occasion.  And at that price well-I think it just might have become one of my new favorites!  I typically like to wear Dolce and Gabbana Burberry and Danielle by Danielle Steele but many perfume sellers dont' ship APO (Army Post Office aka overseas) so I'm forever attemtpting to find something that does and well-this not only takes the cake for shipping to APO but also for the price the amazing smell the packaging and you can't forget the shipping speed!  I'm hooked!Note-I am NOT affiliated in any way shape or form with any seller here on Amazon.  I write reviews because I want other people to know how the product worked out for me and hopefully help them to make an informed decision.  I do not receive any compensation and I'll just as quickly give a  star review if I had a bad experience with the product/seller.  Good luck and happy perfume hunting!!!-Hannah Wonderful amazing GREAT BUY!!!,little bit
Just like its name. This fragance smells so delicious. Its kinda fruity and sweet. A very decent lasting power. Reminds me of the Coco Mademoiselle.The bottle is gorgeous.I am just a total perfume addicted and this fragance has quickly become one of my favorites. Very sensual!,Neutral
I am extremely particular when it comes to perfume. I can never find the perfect scent. I happened to stumble upon this one at my sister in laws home and have been in love with it ever since. I usually grow tired of perfumes after a short while but not this one. It's absolutely pretty and makes me feel glamorous when I wear it! For everyone who says that the fragrance doesn't last you should buy a perfume optimizer. With this being said if you're looking for a pretty sweet fragrance this is it! This price only adds to the greatness of this scent. Pretty fragrance!,Neutral
WOW just freaking WOW!!!  I love this perfume so much.It has a very glamorous sexy and playful scent.Trust me you will not be disappointed at all! Now I want to try all the fragrances by Johan! So sensual!!,Neutral
I've used this off and on through the years and am so sad this seems to be going away :( Of course I stocked up via Amazon because this is one of the few items that really provide satiny smooth skin without the sticky greasy residue. You MUST use it regularly for a month to get the full firming benefit and continuously thereafter. I just like the way it makes my skin feel and the the compliments I receive. The scent smells nice and doesn't fight with your perfume. I can't tell you IF it firms the fluffy parts BUT it makes me feel comfortably confident ready for anything ;) Satiny Smooth Skin,Neutral
Like the easy of use and coverage you get with this product.  No high perfumes and a little extra will cover up some blemishes. Nice coverage,Neutral
I really expected a Hawaiian smell but its not a very good smelling spray at all. It does however work well so if you have a finishing spray or spray a bit of your favorite perfume into your hair it might smell better. It doesn't smell good,favorite perfume
Let me start of by saying....I am a African American female with thick coarse shoulder lenght hair.

I was looking for an organic treatment to leave in my hair and few weeks before I saw this product on amazon I saw a piece about the Argan oils. I have purchase this product and I am sensitive to perfume and there is no added perfumes in this product. Great product,great product

I have been looking for a creamy vanilla scented body lotion to complement my favorite perfume. Also I have been told the vanilla is a good base scent for most perfumes so it won't compete or clash with other scents. I thought this was a fantastic deal for the volume.  The scent is pleasant - not as buttery as I wanted but still very much a solid vanilla. The texture is a bit thin to me. I wish it were creamier and more emollient. I use it as an every day body lotion. My every day body lotion,Neutral
This lotion is amazing! It really is a multi-tasker and has replaced all of my other Shea/cocoa butter body lotions. It does everything it says it does over time. It is not thick or greasy and a little goes pretty far. I did not like this particular vanilla scent because instead of a food smell which I wanted it smells more like a Victoria's Secret lotion with a perfume-y plum smell. Next time I am going to try the coconut fig or lemon one! Does what it says!,Neutral
I received this perfume as a gift. The bottle itself is quite nice. I really liked it. As for the smell at first it did seem very overwhelming to me. I did not spray it onto my skin but into the air and just smelled the spray pump. I didn't really  like it. One evening  I went through my perfumes and thought of smelling it again. I sprayed it on my wrist it was strong at first but after it settled into my skin I honestly loved how exotic and sexy it smelled. I was a little upset that I didn't give it try. Now it's one of my perfumes that I wear going out at night with friends. Intimidating at first but PLEASE give it a chance!!,Neutral
The scent of this perfume is absolutely horrid. It smells like an old woman's musk or a strong manly cologne. I still can't decide which. I purchased this for myself and have only used it once. Also the scent does not last long at all. About  minutes after spraying it on you can not smell it. Would not purchase again. Terrible terrible terrible.,Neutral
I bought this a little over a year ago and it is by far my favorite perfume I have ever used. I wear it every day and it smells amazing! Mine is starting to run low so I will be buying another! Halle Berry Perfume,favorite perfume
I am very sensitive to scents and don't normally wear perfume by celebrities but after smelling Halle byHalle Berry I'm hooked!  I love the vanilla and amber tones. My new favorite perfume!,favorite perfume
Most women's perfumes leave me with a headache if not totally nauseous.  This  lovely come-hither scent from Halle Berry was a very pleasant surprise!  It has just the right combination of scents: sweet without being cloying a soft hint of exotic spice and a wonderfully woody finish.  Warm and gentle it's now the only scent I use and my husband just loves it too.  Perfect for all year round! Come hither my love,Neutral
This is my new favorite perfume! I have several others but when I smelled this scent on my sister I had to have some of my own perfect for a first date or just an every day scent to put on. Smells so good!,favorite perfume
I love this perfume! It is my go to perfume warm and sensual for winter!. I couldn't believe the price for a . oz of it! It has lasted a very long time with more to go.  the only downfall is that it doesn't last as long as I would wish but it smells so good that I will continue buying it my boyfriend loves it also. Incredibly cheap for my favorite perfume!,long time
I love candy type scents. This is candy without any burnt sugar or plastic or musk! I am in HEAVEN! I LOVE this. I bought a nd bottle immediately upon receiving my first. This scent opens just as the note description appears. Sugared grapefruit lychee and sweet jasmine crushed and distilled to perfection. It is the way I imagined that FRESH Sugar Lyche Perfume would be (but isn't). To me this Kabuki scent is very close to the FRESH Sugar Lyche lotion (which is much better then the FRESH perfume that is supposed to match) ! PLEASE make this forever! Lasts about - hours on the skin. Kabuki Perfume - Refreshing and Lovely,Neutral
I purchased this for my wife as a stocking stuffer after reading a review/recommendation in a magazine.It smells nice but is not especialy distinctive from other perfumes.  Probably best for an everyday wear rather than special occasions. Smells nice but not distinctive,Neutral
This perfume smell reminds me of the scent they spray around the spa at the Fountainebleau in Miami Beach.  It goes on a bit strong but the scent fades a bit and is a nice serene scent. Perfume smells nice,Neutral
I read so many great reviews on this perfume that I had to buy it.  I'm so glad I did.  I received it yesterday and sprayed it on my wrist and thought this is gonna be so yummy.  Put it on this morning before I went to work and smelled it on me all day.  I felt warm and relaxed.  I basically just smelled honey and sandalwood. But it smells so good..Try it...u won't be disappointed. Smells so good (Honey & the Moon),Neutral
I need to reorder this because I'm almost out. Smells wonderful. And my husband who dislikes all my perfume really likes this one a lot. Favorite perfume,favorite perfume
This perfume should be clear.  Mine arrived yellow.  Not sure if it's old but there is something wrong with it. ARRIVED YELLOW INSTEAD OF CLEAR,Neutral
I really like vanilla perfumes and Tokyo Milk Dead Sexy has been my signature scent for a while now so I decided to venture more into the TM vanilla category. Let Them Eat Cake smells exactly the same as B&BW Warm Vanilla Sugar so to me it's not worth the retail price of $ for  oz. when I can get a bottle over twice the size for $ from B&BW. Sugar Sugar was a scent I really had high hopes for that it would be sweet but not too sweet and the sandalwood and basmati rice would go very nicely with the coconut and vanilla. This disappointed me when I got it home because it smells so watered down (I purchased it from Tokyo Milk so I know it's genuine). You can't smell it unless you put your nose up against your skin. It's a VERY FAINT coconut like a slight whiff of suntan lotion on the breeze. I can't detect the other notes. The coconut smells good but this is a perfume that really demands layering so I suggest using body lotion with it. A nice summer fragrance I guess but don't expect any compliments on it because no one else will be able to smell it. Tokyo Milk Sugar Sugar,Neutral
If you've tried to find a moisturizing cream designed with anti-aging qualities in mind you may have found that green tea extract is in nearly every one of them. I know this because my mother is allergic to green tea and we've been unable to find her a nightly moisturizer...until now.Ageless Essentials by Neutrogena isn't greasy which I love. You're not smearing this stuff all over your pillow at night and wondering how much Spray n' Wash will it take to get it off the pillow in the wash the next morning.Glycerin and shea butter keep the consistency of this cream smooth and makes it so a little goes a long way. Don't make the mistake of using too much and this small jar will last you a long time.The claim that there are 'time-released' moisturizers may be a bit of a stretch as if you wash your face before you put this cream on at night you probably have moisture on your skin and this simply locks it in.The scent is light and fresh (chrysanthemum) and should not clash with any perfume you may choose to wear. I use a light application around my eyes prior to putting on my mineral makeup and it seems to smooth out the fine lines.Overall I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it. Does NOT contain Green Tea Extract,long way
The Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night moisturizer is the best night moisturized I have used so far.  I've tried many different brands including; Olay Aveeno and a brand only available from my dermatologist and this Neutrogena beats them all.For the last few years I've had sensitive red and in the winter dry skin (thanks Mom) and my dermatologist recommended I used the Glycerin based moisturizer he sold at his office.  It worked well and I used it until it ran out but it was very gloppy and Vaseline like and I did not want to pay what he was asking so I starting trying some over the counter moisturizers.  None of them were as good as the dermatologist's but they worked well enough.This Neutrogena moisturizer however is great.  Like the dermatologist's moisturizer the Neutrogena also contains Glycerin but it goes on smoothly dries very quickly and does not leave my skin sticky or slimy.  After using it for only a week there is a noticeable difference in my skin's texture and appearance.  It is not nearly as dry and has a much more even color with no redness.  I will definitely buy more of this moisturizer when I run out... no more brand switching for me.The only thing I need to mention is that the Neutrogena has a very slight and pleasant fragrance.  It's not perfume like (I've tried some that as a guy smelled way too flowery) it smells like a cleanser almost and while it doesn't bother me I thought it bears mentioning.All in all... an excellent night moisturizer which I have no qualms about recommending. The Best Night Moisturizer I've Ever Used,dry skin
A luxurious treat.. was a soft pleasant surprise to apply this... its gentle and no loud fragrance smell that argues with your chosen perfume. Luxurious...,Neutral
NOT fragrance free.  There is a strong perfume.  Why oh why.  Also it's light purple. Why.IMHO the light night cream is a superior product. It is truly fragrance free and absorbs better. And it's cheaper. NOT fragrance free; the light night cream is a superior product.,Neutral
I have been using this lotion for a little over a week.  I have some super dry sensitive combination skin.  This lotion stings a bit on contact.  Could be the added perfume I'm not sure.It does however keep my face pretty evenly moisturized looking sort of fresh in the morning.  If they can do it without the sting I'd probably keep using it.The consistency is creamy not a thick cream a little lighter than that.  It does smell not bad but there is a distinct odor there. Not for highly sensitive skin,sensitive skin
As a long term Mary Kay Timewise line user I was leery to switch out my nightly moisturizer to try the Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer.I believe that it takes at least two weeks for skin to respond to a change in products. I've used this for two and-a-half weeks now and overall I'm very impressed with the results.The texture is thicker than what I'm accustomed to using. This was a concern because I didn't want to wake up with oil or shiny skin. This was not an issue. Both my neck and face were softer and looked better. Even brighter. There was no oil residue.  This leads me to believe that the moisturizer does indeed have time release capabilities.I did not break out at all during the time that I used this. I also had a cold for part of the time I used this and did not have a raw red nose thanks to the Neutrogena.The jar states that it can be used underneath makeup. For a week of my test period I also used this in the day.  I used the cream under a product that does have SPF in it. I had no problems. Nothing ran down my face. No excess oil. It didn't cause my eyeliner or makeup to run or come off.Excellent overall product. My only note is that there is a fragrance that may be bothersome to those sensitive to perfumes or scents. It took me a few days to get used to it. It did not bother my allergies but want to point it out for others.I would recommend this and I do plan on continuing using the jar I was given to sample.  I also think there is a possibility that I will be permanently replacing my former nighttime moisturizer with it.Update //: I did end up switching to the Neutrogena ageless essentials system. LOVE IT!!!!! Impressed by the results,Neutral
As with all neutrogena products not a problem for my acne prone skin.  As expected in a night cream on the thicker side but feels fine.  Unexpectedly this still had a slight perfumey smell which I can't stand having on my face at night. good but scent still too strong,Neutral
The name of the product is pretty captivating Ageless Essentials. Most people would like to look a little younger and I'm no different.I don't think it will do much for my deeper wrinkles but it reads that it significantly smoothes the appearance of fine lines and I hope it does. Two nights application isn't enough time for me to determine if that's true.It does have a light perfumed scent but that fades away quickly after applying it. Still I think it would be nicer without any scent. That's just my own opinion though. Ageless Essentials,Neutral
I've always liked the Neutrogena products although I've gotten away from using them the past couple of years since I've tried to switch most of my products to those that are cruelty free (this one isn't). Social issues aside this product works just as the packaging says it will.This is a light lotion which is perfect for my overly dry but very sensitive skin. I've found that most moisturizers will help the dryness but will cause breakouts. I've been using the Ageless Essentials product for nearly  weeks now and I'm happy to say that it has helped my dry skin without also causing my skin to break out - something I appreciate since it's not very pleasant to deal with pimples at the age of .I also spend so much time trying to find a moisturizer that doesn't smell like it has a bottle of perfume dumped into it. The Ageless Essentials has a fresh airy scent that is rather pleasant. The scent doesn't cling to my pajamas or bed linens and I don't wake up smelling it in the morning.This little jar goes a long way. It doesn't take much of the lotion at all to adequately moisturize my face neck and upper chest. Normally these moisturizers are so expensive and don't last too long but this bottle is holding up and I think it is a reasonable price for something that will last for a while.The only possible exception to the does what it promises statement is whether or not the mositurizer will help fill in fine lines. My skin is smoother and softer but I really don't notice any difference with the little lines that are starting to show up on my face. Since this isn't a priority for me right now I'm not at all bothered by this very minor drawback. I like the lotion. I think it makes my skin softer. It's affordable and it's from a name that I trust. That's good enough for me! Does what it promises,long way
I have used a number of moisturizing lotions including some very expensive ones from Lancome. Because I have sensitive skin and acne almost every product I've tried either irritated my skin didn't moisturize for long or made me break out horribly. I had basically given up on moisturizers and have lived with taut dry but oily skin for a number of years. I recieved this as a sample to review with great hesitation. I am no longer skeptical and very glad that I tried it.The glycerin based moisturizer:Did not clog my pores.Did not leave my skin red.Did not feel greasy.Didn't make my face shine like a coat of oil.Didn't smudge make up applied over top.Doesn't smell like a pharmacy or perfume bottle.Isn't thick and gloppy.Doesn't sit on the skin but absorbs in minutes.Left my skin the moistest and most pliable it has ever felt.I used the formula overnight several times and was pleased so I tried it under make up and was equally happy with the results.In fact I applied an acne medicine that reacted with my cleanser and ended up with a mild chemical burn on my face leaving me bright red. In an attempt to relieve the itching and burning I applied this moisturizer and gained relief.  I'm going to let some of my friends try it.  I would enthusiastically endorse it. Excellent product. Modest price. Does NOT clog pores.,sensitive skin
Bought this shampoo to try it out. Love the smell and the way it feels. Amazon price is awesome especially with our Subscribe & Save. The shampoo has a pleasant smell that is not overpowering so that you don't feel like you just took a bath in perfume. Worth every penny. Suave shampoo humectant moisture,Neutral
I'm not sure how long I'll use this to see if it helps my damaged hair.  It's heavily perfumed and not in a good way. Warning!,Neutral
i am a pretty attractive girl to begin with getting this pheromones was just for fun and a test. when i received the product i was going to run errands that day just to see what happens. this product is oily so keep that in mind it does give an oily sheen to the skin where ever you put it and you can still feel it after a while of putting it on. it comes with a shaker dropper (you take the cap off and shake the product out) i applied to all the necessary spots neck wrist cleavage behind the ear. also keep in mind i only put this product on no lotion no perfume and i had a shower that morning before i applied the product and i was all done out with make up also (lol if that helps) so first test was at the bank its the first day of the month you know its super crowded lines out to the door so i had a good crowd to work with lol i noticed that i had older men look at me it was kinda weird being only  lol i had another guy look at me while he was on the phone and that was it!! are you kidding me !? so I'm kinda disappointed for now it was like i had just applied baby oil to my skin and went out waiting for guys to start hitting on me. i will update this product when im almost done with the product im not sure?,Neutral
 day money back guaranteed??  days? I guess the  days is so you can forget about this stuff and not return it. A scientist I am not but this stuff should mix with your chemistry quicker than   days.  I have tried it alone mixed with lotion and with my perfume...still nothing. My new hair cut worked better. Basically $ plus dollars for some oil. Note to self: pay attention to the reviews. Expected More For The Price,Neutral
I can't use this product because the perfume is so strong it would give me a headache. So I had to return it. I am sad though because people seem to love how well it works. I just wish it wasn't so overpowering. Smells SOOOOOO STRONG!!!!!,Neutral
Upon reading all the wonderful reviews about this product I decided to buy this and the Lo-Poo by Deva. BIG mistake. This actually left my hair hard and my curls flat by morning. I was very disappointed in this product and really wanted to like it but after numerous attempts alas it just does not work for me. A hefty price to pay for a product that does nothing but leave my hair smelling perfumed hard dry and flat by morning! I do however use the Deva gel and it's great. Just too bad this was not the same. I will continue to be a curly girl and use L'Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Conditioner that is % vegan and not tested on animals with no animal byproducts. Did I miss something here?,Neutral
This product was just okay for me. The smell was very strong and perfume-y. Not of natural Lavender essential oil unfortunately so I won't be purchasing again. Smells strong and unnatural.,Neutral
This perfume is a gorgeous combo of mulled wine tropical tuberose and incense. I find it perfect for autumn or winter. It's sexy but accesible. Plus its so cheap online. autumnal bliss,Neutral
I bought this  parfum spray for my sister she loves it is very good she told me that smell  last more than other is true.... perfume best,Neutral
Usually I avoid Oriental perfumes; the fragrance seems too warm and intense for me. CK Secret Obsession however surprised me with its exotic allure. I am a collector of perfumes and I bought it on a whim. I honestly didn't expect much but as the perfume opened to a tantalizing mixture of plum rose and something I didn't recognize I was astounded.The note of sandalwood bewitched me and I'm going to keep it for special occasions e.g. marriage ceremonies and such like. I also feel that it's a winter perfume a really a special perfume. However not everybody is going to appreciate it. You have to be really fond of amber sandalwood and patchouli to like CK Secret Obsession.It's also very different from the original Obsession which reminds me of Channel no  or the original Miss Dior. What I mean to say is I love Original Obsession too but this one is gorgeous in a very different way. Oriental & Spicy,Neutral
SO leaves an abstract gourmand impression without being a gourmand. SO is very much like a vanilla coca-cola or a rootbeer float. More specifically to me it's an A&W; ROOTBEER FLOAT. Yes root beer & vanilla ice cream in all it's fizzy frothy glory from top to bottom. SO isn't about the notes & progression it's about the impression it leaves. A gourmand without being a gourmand. Brilliant!SO is very American & very well-done. I pledge my love. It's the oriental vanilla that I'm adopting for Fall.SO is misunderstood and the thumbs-down reviews are not reflective of the fragrance. Rather I think the thumb-downs are reflective of the disconnect between the fragrance and its advertising. SO is not sex-in-a-bottle and there is nothing come-hither about it. SO is a jeans & sweater weather perfume perfect for baking cookies or attending football games. SO is young & up-beat but I think women in the middle would be most attracted to it.Word of warning. SO's white florals are just on the edge of cloying for me perhaps more so in heat. I have the same problem with florals in SO's otherwise likable (but not as good) sister CK Obsession Night Woman which is unwearable in warm weather. SO is another one of the CK's with hard-to-wear florals.The downside? Lasting power. Otherwise SO would be SO perfect. I love SO but am so underwhelmed by the longevity. I've resorted to use SO in my scent bug rather than on me. That may sound strange but I love it this way! Beautiful but not long lasting.,Neutral
--UPDATE --:  I used this device off and on for about a year. It's okay but I recently got a Tria Skin laser device. That's a much better product and will produce better results. Spend your five hundred on the Tria not this thing would be my own personal recomendation.--I've been using the Stop device for six weeks now so it's still a little early to draw a final conclusion but so far I can say it operates as it's supposed to. It's simple to use and it's pretty cool the way it shuts off just when it gets to the pain level. I've been using it on level high and I don't move it very quickly over my face so that I make sure to feel the sting. I do the right half of my face one day and the left half on the next and my neck on day three. I make several pases and spend about  to  minutes. I have seen a very minor tightening effect thus far: it does seem to be improving my skin tone. I'm in my fifties but I have really good skin and just very slight sagging so I don't need a lot. I will say this though it is a bit of a chore to use it and so one needs to be motivated to stick with it. As a side note I want to add: the gel that comes with this is heavily perfumed so if you're sensitive to that as I am you might want to get some glycerin based product as a substitute which I've read works just as well. Anyway I'll do an update in a few weeks.UPDATE -- -- Alright I've been using it about two months now and I can definitely see improvement in my skin. There is some general tightening and my skin looks a little smoother. Nothing dramatic but definitely something to be happy about. I'll update again in a couple of weeks.UPDATE: -- -- No big changes from my last update - I'm in maintenance mode now. I'm still happy with the subtle improvement the Stop has made to my face. I notice in the morning especially that  my skin is tighter than it was four months ago. It hasn't taken ten years off my face but it does make it look slightly better. I do use other products as well I should mention. I derma needle every six weeks and also do a TCA peel every few months. I use Retin-a as well. I think using *all* this stuff definitely pays off.UPDATE: -- -- In the past month I've gotten some more noticeable results from the Stop by moving the device even more slowly over my face -- even pausing it briefly in certain spots letting it burn a little more. It is a bit risky to do it this way because it sometimes can cause blistering. I did have this happen a couple of times but everything did heal well. Anyway the more intensely you apply the heat from this thing the more results you're going to get. I work at home so it's not a problem for me to have a couple of red spots on my face from time to time so I'm willing to be aggressive. This device does work but I would agree with others who've said the results are good but not necessarily amazing.UPDATE: -- -- So after six months of using it I'll say this thing was on balance a good purchase. But while it makes a slight improvement in your face with regular use don't expect miracles. I do continue to use it along with TCA peels but the TCA peels actually have more effect. My preliminary impression: favorable,Neutral
I am one of those people who hate having dry hands.  Since I wash my hands a lot throughout the day I find a need to apply lotion regularly and this is the best I have found.  I keep one bottle in my kitchen one bottle on the night stand for before bed and a smaller tube in my purse.I have used many many lotions over the years and this is the best I have found plus the price is great.  The lotion is thick and works well plus it isn't greasy -- a little goes a long way.  There is very little perfume in it so the odor is minimal but what there is it's pleasing.  I have had several friends convert to this after borrowing some of mine.As others have stated trying to get the product out of the bottom is a bit tricky.  So far I find that I can turn the bottle upside down and get the remainer out but it's so thick that it isn't easy.  I used some regular Vaseline lotion the other day which I hadn't used in a while and was shocked at the difference.  I would never go back to anything else (even with the difficulty of getting all the product out).  Wonderful lotion! Used for years extremely happy,long way
This is a great primer especially for those with oily skin. It is matte and gives a wonderful base for you to apply your makeup on. It has the added benefit of SPF which makes it even better. Controls shine for hours and helps keep your makeup in place. It does have a perfumey smell but it goes away after a bit. If you aren't a fan of fragrances you might not care for this product. It doesn't really bother me though because this product does such a great job that I can forgive the smell. GREAT primer,Neutral
I am a Britney Perfume fan. I have used Fantasy Circus Curious Midnight and Radiance. I like all but Curious. I had been looking for this one for some time. I finally gave up and found it. My boyfriend decided as an little early Valentine's day gift to buy it. I tried it on and fell in love with it. I was complimented on the perfume. I love the smell of Citrus in it. It is a good date-night perfume. It makes me feel sexy just wearing it. Another winner,Neutral
as with any perfumes you only have to use a small amount and it willbe just fine.I recommend this but in small amounts.Don't take a bath in it. nice scent little bit strong,little bit
I must admit I'm a fan of Britney's perfumes.  Specifically I absolutely adore the Fantasy line.  The only one I haven't liked so far is Circus Fantasy just because I gravitate more towards vanillas and patchoulis and Circus smells like nothing but flowers to me.  Hidden Fantasy is tied as my favorite Spears fragrance along with the original.  They both smell delicious but Hidden Fantasy hides the vanilla behind some sweet orange and tangerine so it's not as bakery-shop sweet as the original Fantasy.  Lasts for hours on my wrists plus I got the . oz. bottle on Amazon for a GREAT price = very happy purchase! ANOTHER GREAT FANTASY!,Neutral
What can I say all Britney spears perfume r the best!! This smells so good it's so sexy ! And it stays on for a lOng time the! I rlly love this scent and I will buy this again Love it!,long time
Cleans thoroughly without using much product and moisturizes effectively.  It is a little bit perfumey but still smells pleasant and isn't too overpowering.  I have somewhat fine wavy hair and this works well for me. Great shampoo,little bit
I absolutely love this product. It smells amazing! If I could find a perfume that smelled exactly like this I would buy it; fortunately the smell lingers a few hours after I use this stuff. The exfoliation isn't as extreme as other body washes I've used but I like that it's not too abrasive. I hope they never discontinue this product it's simply amazing. I have a stockpile of this stuff,Neutral
I've rated other body washes and this one is second to none!  It is perfect.  It's got a soft peppermint smell it lathers nicely and it's made from mostly natural ingredients (-something percent...I cannot recall the exact number).  This body wash makes you feel clean without feeling slimy or squeeky clean.  Just CLEAN.  It has a fresh SOFT scent and it's suitable for men or women...or kids as well.  I am allergic to many perfumes but this lightly scented wash does not bother me at all.I recommend this product wholeheartedly.  I'd give it six stars if I could. This product is a MUST HAVE -- the BEST body wash ever,Neutral
I recently received a spa massage and was hoping to purchase the oil they used for it but was told it was for professional sale only so I immediately went to Amazon to see what was available.  This is a nice rich massage oil that glides on the skin and makes you feel dewy soft smells great but absorbs so quickly that the scent only lasts for an hour or so.  Granted I didn't use as much oil as a masseuse would but if you don't want to rinse the oils off after a massage to go out this has absolutely no oily feel and you can take advantage of the continued hydration as well as use perfume without overdoing it.  This is also one of the more value priced oils available as some can get very expensive at more than double or triple the price.  My only wish since I'm not a fan of perfume in general is for the scent to linger longer but overall it's a great value. Smells wonderful absorbs quickly,Neutral
If you are a floral fiend you will love this one!While this perfume dries down I find the scent very strong - a lot of floral notes notably on me: hyacinth orange blossom with hints of the peach.  There was also an underlying green scent that I can only attribute to the herbs - very fresh clean.  Once this dries down it still remains strong for a little while but the scents are more blended and it calms into a softer sweet floral bouquet. Now and then I would catch a whiff and think that smells nice what is that? only to realize it's my arm I'm smelling. The oil does last a long time so probably rolling this on in the morning will take you into the evening.Betrothal is without a doubt floral and does it well. If you love this type of scent give it a shot because Betrothal IS a a very lovely bouquet.  It's not cloyingly sweet but instead is fresh and crisp and I give it thumbs up for that. It's not one that I wear daily because I have always been more partial to the darker brown sugars musks and vanilla but I like having this for spring and summer when the heavier scents might be a bit too much for the weather. Flowers and More Flowers,long time
My first thought on this fragrance after wearing the perfume all day... If that famous poem Daffodils (by Wordsworth) had a smell this would be it. This fragrance is for true floral lovers. A spring delight of yes..Daffodils. The pansy and sweat pea add to a mixed floral bouquet. There's a splash of fresh young spring greenery brought on by the herbal notes. The gentle touch of fruit adds brightness and vigor. A bright floral perfume full of youth happiness health and sunshine. A  Star Floral,Neutral
I'm not into flower perfumes at all. However I will say that I tried this and found that it DID smell just like fresh cut flowers.Sadly I'm not a huge fan of the smell of daffodils but I did like the little bit of dill and peaches that came through. The thingabout skin chemistry is that sometimes a person's skin amps one aspect of a perfume whereas another person will amp a differentnote in the perfume so while this one was % daffodil that doesn't mean it will be that way for you or that it's the perfume'sfault that I didn't like it. I would say that if I had a huge bouquet of flowers I would appreciate this smell but I'm just nota person who likes flower perfume it seems. I am bumping it up from  stars (since I don't like flower perfumes) to  stars becauseit smells exactly like what it sets out to smell like and also because after about an hour of wearing it it started to smell reallypretty for - minutes before mostly disappearing. That's another thing about personal skin chemistry is that sometimes a person'sskin will eat the perfume. You can help avoid this by putting on lotion before the perfume or in some cases your skin will just eatcertain notes. Mara at Love Potion does sell an unscented base (DPG something???) that is kind of like makeup primer but for perfumes.You know how if you're a lady and you wear makeup your makeup can sometimes sink into your pores or get greasy and slide off? Well perfumeis kind of the same way since your skin really does absorb stuff so the dpg (whatever it is) helps provide a layer. I haven't used itpersonally but I've read a lot of good things about it on the love potion perfume forum. Anyway beautiful artwork and I really wish mypersonal skin chemistry didn't amp daffodils or at least had the perfume stick around when it was in it's pretty stage. Sidenote: I havequite a few perfumes by this company and most that I've tried really do stick around so don't take this review as one that would lead youto believe that their perfumes are short-lived. There's some that have lasted me  hours and beyond. Flower perfumes don't tend to go that great on me but...,little bit
I bought this product months ago and discontinued using it after I showered and exfoliated at night because of the smell.  I dunno some people don't mind it but my nose is really sensitive to scents and it felt like being enveloped in tacky cheap perfume smell all night long!  Yuck.Well I broke it out again because it's that time of year again and I haven't been able to find anything else that is this natural.I happened to apply it in the morning after a shower wore it all day and the smell did not bother me at all!  I've been using it regularly for a month now and it hasn't bothered me at all any more.  Just shower put the lotion on and then wait a few min to dress.  Maybe the extra clothing gives enough of a barrier that it doesn't bother my nose and moving around gets the smell to evaporate more quickly.  Have had no problems with it staining my clothes. Tip: Apply in the Morning to Avoid Smell,Neutral
I have been considering trying an asian shampoo for awhile now and was certainly not disappointed.  A little background: I am mixed (korean and white) but have more of a typical asian hair type (very thick straight hair). Most drugstore and salon brands work fine (maybe a little dry and frizzy at the ends) but I've always had a little problem of my scalp breaking out because my skin produces a lot of oil when not moisturized enough.  Having heard that camellia (tsubaki) oil works wonders for hair and skin I decided to try this product.  First the smell of this set is absolutely amazing.  They really should make a perfume of this scent because I'm a little obsessed.  It does fade a little quickly on my hair though.  As far as the efficacy of the product the shampoo I felt was not drying at all.  I could feel an immediate difference in the feel of my hair (maybe a bit thicker and smoother?) it felt very healthy.  This shampoo gave me a nice clean without drying.  I got the impression of balance.  The conditioner didn't have as much of the slick feeling when washing off that I normally associate with conditioner but it actually made my hair softer and more noticeably moisturized than other conditioners.  The treatment was lovely as well.  I left it on for about  minutes and it seemed to make my hair even more soft and moisturized.  After my hair dried (I've tried blow drying and air drying) it felt noticeably soft sleek and healthier.  My hair doesn't normally do sleek without any work but it just laid really nicely.  I didn't notice any greasiness and within a week my scalp is actually no longer breaking out!Pros:-beautiful addictive smell-large amount-healthy balanced moisture for hair AND scalp-makes hair smooth and sleek w/out weighing it down-made my scalp stop breaking outCons:-scented (for those who don't like that)-bottle is in Japanese (for people who like to read the bottle) but came with a little label w/ingredients and instructions in english-not really a con for the product but my boyfriend knocked over the shower caddy on accident and the pump for the shampoo shattered ;_; so I guess try not to drop it.Overall this has become my HG of hair product. Will absolutely buy again. Best hair product,Neutral
Nice feel but strong perfume smell.  I am sensitive to odors and could not take it.  The company was easy to deal with and took it back.  I only used it a few times so can't comment on its efficacy. Strong smell,Neutral
Daverat's Wife speaking (forgive my typos please I have Rheumatoid Arthritis) As many lines for African-American Women are trying to reach new audiences their advertising will often say For all Hair Types in their descriptions.  While it is in fact TRUE that their products CAN be used by all hair types not all people with thinner or naturally straighter hair will be familiar with both the purpose of such a product and how much of it to apply which is why you will see some angry or bad reviews here from Users who tried this very nourishing natural Marula Oil spray and found they had over-applied the product only to wind up with greasy hair.  I have what has been called Ethnic hair which frizzes easily and if left to its own will loc up into long spirals that are hard to disentangle.  Since my hair is waist length my thirsty waves are the perfect hair for just about any product originally marketed to Women of Color.  However my husband who is of English and Scandanavian descent has fine curly hair and he can use these products too just much more sparingly.  Remember when you see something saying For all hair types but see photos showing women of color in the ads that if you have baby fine hair that is straight as can be you will need to experiment by using much less at first until you find the correct amount to gain some moisture or shine benefit.  If you just spray the stuff on as directed you may wind up looking like Fonzie on a saturday night!That said Marula Oil in the new Motions Natural Therapy Hair & Scalp Oil Spray has a long history of use by Native Tsonga peoples of South Africa and Mozambique both as a body and hair moisturizer and in cooking.  The oil comes from the nut of the Marula tree whose species is known as Sclerocarya birrea. There is also Marula seed oil in the mix.  Other beneficial ingredients in the hair oil include extracts of Chamomile Lavendar Black Elderberry Flower (Sambucus nigra) Sunflower Common Cowslip flower (a type of Primrose) Calendula Rosemary and extract of Cinnamon bark.  There are several other botanical ingredients.  I translated the ones I could identify easily into their common names for ease of reading.  There are other soothing ingredients such as Rose oil (listed as Geraniol) lemon oil honey and several more.It all works together to form a very light citrus scented oil with notes of spices and nuts.  The oil is in a spray bottle and it may take a few tries before you get the spray pump to give you evenly measured sprays so I would suggest spray it into the trash first until you get even sprays ( just a few sprays).  Then I further suggest spraying one spray into the palm of your hand rubbing your hands together and then gently aplying it to the thirstiest or most damaged parts of your hair wet or dry.  Their derections have you spraying this right UNTO your hair and I feel this is a mistake if you have thinner or baby fine hair.  The mist isn't fine enough.I use it as a work-in oil treatment.  I put some in as a leave in-conditioner before detangling my hair and then again after my hair is dry.  I also use it as a styling aid to help me use a paddle brush to put my hair upinto a french twist or into any  braids or protective style such as twists.  I have a few dry spots on my scalp at the hairline around my ears and on the back of my neck that suffer from having my hair in tension styles and I spray some of the Marula oil into my palm and use my fingers to daub it directly into those dry spots.  it doesn't sting like some treatments and it immediately relieves the soreness helping to reduce flakes and inflammation.I really like this product and I was surprised because some of the other Motions products had too heavy of a perfume for me.  This product has a light and pleasant scent.  The oil is equally light when applied with your hands and not sprayed directly unto the hair as their directions suggest.  If you had bad results spraying this ONTO your hair try my way of spraying it INTO your palms and then gently working it INTO your hair only where it is most needed.  If you have a normally greasy scalp apply the oild mostly to your damaged ends and then as a light finishing touch as you pat it over the area where you normally part your hair.  The oil helps nourish those broken hairs we all get at our parts and helps them lay down flat.  If you have a lot of breakage on your part line I suggest using a light hair wax to really tamp down those horrible itty bitty cowlicks!  That works for me as does changing up the area of my part line by an th of an inch every few days.This product may seem too greasy for people not used to applying oils directly to their hair.  Don't be put off by that.  If you are product-testing a bottle give it another try and use my method of spraying it into your palms and not at your hair.  Their spraying mechanism doesn't disperse the oil in fine enough a mist if you ask me.  There are bound to be spots that get ten times too much.  If you work it in with your hands that won't happen.  I would never srpay this directly unto my hair and most of my hair can use a goodly amount of oil!  Use your hands for best results.Overall I find this to be a great new Hair Oil product cheaper than mot Argan Oils which used to be the Gold Standard of hair oil treatments and the scent is far more pleasant than the new Suave Argan Oil spray calledSuave Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil  Ounce.  This Motions Marula Oil Therapy is also LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE of that Suave Product!  How's that for a shocker?THIS product IS the best bargain in hair oil sprays  along withCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil  Fluid Ounce.  Both Motions and Clear Scalp Shea are based on African Nut butters and neither have the overpowering perfume that is in the Suave product.  Save $ to $ bucks and go with either Motions or Clear Scalp's Oil products.  Clear Scalp doesn't even use a spray you just put some drops in your hands and apply the way I do with this product.  This is one Hair Oil I will want to have on hand always! Designed for African American Hair or any Thick Brittle hair that needs extra care pleasant citrusy aroma too!,argan oil
I never was able to find a shampoo made for: dry hair oily scalp-then I found this! I wondered if I'd notice it help my oily scalp which contained a small portion of oily dandruff. Once I washed it lathered GREAT. And I felt it actually sinking into my scalp going after the oily dandruff! I can't explain. It wasn't like a stinging or tingling dandruff shampoo. And the smell.......It's great. It's not very scented but the scent it is is great. I have a very sensitive nose to perfume smells and this is nothing like that nor strong smelling like that. Great for oily scalp dry hair,Neutral
This is an excellent foaming cleanser at a great price.  The product is super thick and a tiny bit foams up almost as much as a shaving cream!  In other words a little goes a long way and I think it will last much longer than the .oz size led me to believe.  This cleanser has a very lovely subtle scent similar to the shampoo in this collection.  The scent is a mellow sweet peach that so far does not seem to carry floral or citrus notes like many products do.  For those of you who are sensitive to strong perfume scents you should be ok but obviously those folks who have issues with any scented products will want something else.  As a cleanser this performs beautifully.  I am using Ponds cold cream (oil based) as my makeup remover until I can pull in a good oil cleanser so I typically use this after my makeup is removed.  This removed all traces of oily residue from the cream (as well as a fairly heavy bb cream and cream blush when I tested it by itself).  After cleansing I was left with soft smooth squeaky clean skin (also felt no bumps from blackheads on my nose) and my pores actually seemed less noticeable.  Now I personally always follow up cleanser with a good moisturizer so for those of you who don't I can't really say what the effect will be after a few hours but having combination skin myself I did not notice any dryness or oiliness in the few minutes before I applied moisturizer (and that has happened with some products).  Lastly this product arrived very quickly for me.  This particular brand seems to be fairly easy to obtain at larger asian markets in the US so those of us who aren't in a major city or don't want to drive  hours to get to one (or pay for the gas) can have this shipped within a few days (instead of weeks) from within the US.  I used the seller PrimeSourceValue and had a good experience.PROS - Great subtle scent- A little goes a long way- Really effective cleanser- Available in the USCONS - For those who are very sensitive it is scented- Instructions in Japanese so people who don't know how to use facial cleansers may have to go elsewhere to find out how it works...**Typically you wet your face squeeze a little product into your hand work it into a lather massage onto face and rinse off. Great addition to the routine,long way
One of the annoying things that I've discovered about growing older is that things that should have been left in my past - like acne - not only stick around but sometimes get worse. Such is life.I don't have excessive acne but I do battle breakouts on occasion and my skin would never be described as clear and healthy. I've tried various products to alleviate acne. Most of them work somewhat but none of them has ever done the job consistently.I used the Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash for a couple of weeks on a trial basis. Here's my experience:I like the tube and cap design of the package. It's easy to store and easy to use. I also like the scent of this product. It has a light pleasant scent that doesn't leave me smelling like I just took a bath in perfume. Best of all the scent isn't girlie; my husband can use this wash.The consistency of this wash is odd and a bit off-putting. It's thick and has an almost mucous feel to it. It lathers on the skin ok but then it takes forever to rinse off. I think I have to rinse my face for nearly five minutes to get all traces of this off my skin. I learned to be very careful and tie back my hair before using this because if I get it in my hair it takes a while to rinse out.I find that my skin is quite smooth and soft after I use this. I like that. I was afraid that this wash would dry out my face (most products do). I don't see any increase in dryness although my face often feels tight. I also find that some of my trouble areas (creases around my nose) are clearer after using this. Unfortunately I also started getting some really large pimples in places on my face where I've never had them before. Pimples that take days to go away. It's such an odd experience to have a product that is supposed to help control the acne actually make the acne worse. I don't know if it's the consistency of the wash. Perhaps even with all the rinsing I'm still not removing all of it from my skin? I'm not sure but after a couple of weeks I've gone back to my old face cleansing routine.I think a tried and true rule applies to this product - some people will try it and love and some will try it with little or no success. It doesn't work for me. Washes the face but doesn't get rid of acne,Neutral
clearasil very refreshing feeling love the scent very lite not loud perfume scentwould definetely recommend this product leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshingalso removes makeup really well I like it,Neutral
I like how you only need a very little bit to lather up well. It goes in creamy unless you get it wet first before applying to you face.  My pores are definitely less clogged after a couple weeks of using this.  I really like it except for the scent. I prefer unscented products. Very strong perfume smell,Neutral
Active Ingredients; Avobenzone % Homosafate % Octlsalate % Oxybenzone % and Inactive ingredients more and more chemicals. But wait look at your budget and look at all other sunscreens which are not organic. They all have the same formulas chemicals with the only difference of the amount of each singular chemical. NO-ADs are Broad Spectrum water resistant meaning protection of  minutes come in  oz which is much much more than the competition at  oz or less with the same formula for half the cost and bingo it really offered me protection. That is all favorable review except if you happen to read ingredients like I do and care about what I consume. Then ingredients like any type of BENZONE which are all carcinogens the active ingredient in NO-AD and most sunscreens become questionable. All other recommendations by Consumer Report do not have any different chemicals only percentages of chemicals since they all use chemicals nothing organic. Now if organic not important only protection then you may as well consider NO-AD otherwise continue on reading...Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans' salty water without any shade which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is then for a surfer like me usually higher organic ingredients are the best. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin. I don't intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen. Usually those SPFs will not be over  for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs. I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn pain cancer medical bills pain killers etc. that come with exposure to the sun. I try different brands all the time and look for the following pointers;. I avoid water proof or water resistant. How stupid I am going in the ocean in salt water under the sun. Even if I put a deck coating or a roof on my skin it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid water. Natural sunscreens with FEWER chemicals. Manufacturers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. So stupid since a chemical is a chemical regardless. FRAGRANCE FREE; It must spell out on the face of the container. Majority have fragrance but baby sunscreens usually do not. After all I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance regardless and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day. EXPIRATION DATE; I never leave the sunscreen container in the sun purchase new sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old I always apply  minutes before the first exposure to the sun. BROAD SPECTRUM; It must spell out on the face of the container. PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container. I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system. I avoid vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which seems to boost skin cancer risk. I Look for ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of zinc or titanium the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. Unscented Baby Formula and must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group's annual Sunscreen Guide.I tried NO-AD  and  which is called SPORT or KIDS. There is no difference in their lotions except the SPF numbering the rest is marketing. The only stamp on the container was NL-- meaning it was produced on the  day of . The lotions are oil-free but not the sprays. It absorbs nicely without any perfumes or smell and more importantly no sunburn which is dangerous to my health. Discolored my shirt and there is a warning on NO-AD as well so I kept it away from my clothes. I noticed that after several hours of surfing when I was rubbing my face before shower the suntan lotion was peeling off. Meantime I noticed the same as I got in the water. Although the heavy coat dries without a white mask on my face in the water it peels off like a dead skin. Contacted NO-AD and they had no idea. Consumer Report recommends this as well as many other brands that offer great protection but Consumer Report never pays attention to ingredients and ingredients are important to me. It offered protection but now I prefer the ones with less chemicals and more organic sunscreens which I have come across and consuming those without carcinogens. In the past I paid $. for any of NO-AD sunscreens. Read Ingredients...,Neutral
I haven't found a better leave-in creme heat protectant that works as well as this one does (and that smells great while doing it)!  When using this product in my hair people routinely ask me what perfume is that? when it's really just the Nectar Thermique.  This product protects my ultra-fine thin hair from being scorched with my heat tools and makes it shiny and healthy while controlling frizz too. It is a little expensive but the . ounce bottle lasts a long time since a little goes a long way (use too much and your hair can look greasy). I love this product!,Neutral
Have been using a semi liquid form of African black soap for a few months for my face amazing.  My skin is cleaner pores appears to be smaller my very sensitive skin has been clearer and feels almost squeaky clean after washing it no more feeling like I missed a spot.My skin:  sensitive to most everything oily but dry? (I know what??) not many breakouts but every so often a big monster pimple would appear take forever to go away and sometimes leave a tell tale dark spot behind flaky at times.  Definitely a combo type of skin.  Have tried and been disappointed by more products than I care to list.I bought this Dudu-Osun bar to see if the rest of my skin would like African Black soap as much as much face has.  Only been using about a week and I must say its pretty wonderful.  Surprisingly large bar which appears like it will last a good long time.  This product makes my arms and legs feel super clean and smells clean not perfumed or chemically.  Just smooth soft and clean.I use African Black to cleanse followed by Tamanu oil / argan oil for my face (Love Tamanu and both were purchased via Amazon) and Natural Shea butter (from amazon) for the rest of my body.  My skin has not looked this good for a very long time.  I am so pleased and will continue to buy and recommend (have already converted several of my co-workers and friends who all have been converted!)Thanks Amazon for offering such great products at such affordable prices !! Great cleanser,long time
I can thank Michael Landon for our purchase of Yardley Lemon Verbena with Shea Butter Bar Soap. Let me explain. Our sons Kai (age ) and Kou (age ) are nearly finished watching the third season ofThe Little House on the Prairie. It is from this TV series that my boys learned how Laura and her sisters adored Lemon Verbena perfume.I scoured Amazon looking for a relatively inexpensive way to share the scent. Thankfully this item is available because of the new Add-on program which allows Amazon to offer thousands of low-priced items that would be cost-prohibitive to ship on their own. These items ship with qualifying orders over $ and are eligible for free shipping.The bar of soap arrived in a small cardboard box placed inside a larger box with other orders. I could smell the soap through two layers of cardboard. Opening the smallest box had the same effect you'd expect from lighting a scented candle. Now I'm not saying it was an offensive smell but it was strong. Ultimately we tested the bar in the shower and the whole household had the distinct smell of Lemon Verbena. Its ability to mask a multitude of sins including irregular bathing perhaps explains why this particular scent was so popular in the sRating: Five stars. Amazon's new Add-On program makes this affordable,Neutral
Its smells really good as if you wear a franch perfume and it keeps your hair soft smooth and shiny. I recommand it,Neutral
I've used Deep Cleansing Oil for years and was so glad to see it available on Amazon now.  It is hands down the best cleanser that I have ever used.  Just one little squirt rubbed over your dry face will remove all traces of make-up including mascara but it washes away cleanly with warm water leaving no oily feeling behind.  I don't know how it works but it does.  It leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh with no harsh chemicals or perfumes.I've recommended this to all my friends and people are always skeptical when they hear it's Cleansing OIL.  They expect greasy and hard to rinse off but once they try it they are hooked as well.If you suffer from allergies to perfumes dyes or have sensitive skin this is an ideal product.  Just give it a try and be prepared to be amazed. The Best Cleanser - Period!,sensitive skin
I have tried everything out there. I swear. I tried this product and fell in love with cleansing oils (once I discovered how they work I tried several other brands). I have tried Bosia as well. I think the DHC one is probably the best because of the size of the bottle in relation to the price the natural low-odor scent (which is basically none so you know it's not loaded with crap chemicals) and it's smooth THIN consistency. The thinner the oil the faster you can spread it over your dry face. Bosia (which you can buy at Ulta) is a little thicker so it doesn't spread and glide over your eye area as fast or easily as the DHC and for the price the bottle is a lot smaller.At the end of the day/night I start my shower water and right before I step in I pump  full pumps into my DRY hands rub my hands together fast to kinda warm up the oil and then apply it to my DRY face and start rubbing small circles all around my face & eye area (I've got the oil in my eyes before and nothing happened because it's so light and natural) and then I step into the shower and when the water hits my face I just kinda rub a few small circles over my face and it rinses completely clean and there is not a trace of waterproof eyeliner or mascara left behind. It's AMAZING. I typically follow up with a general face wash like Cetaphil. The cleansing oil is mainly just to remove my makeup but it's probably not % necessary because the oil does make your skin feel squeaky clean after you rinse it off. Then I use witch hazel as a toner and then apply % all natural argan oil on my eyes face neck and chest at night. I love the routine because it goes so quickly and effortlessly and I don't feel like I'm loading my face up with perfumes dyes preservatives etc. Fastest way to take off makeup,argan oil
I can't tell if this is working - maybe because I have dark dark brown hair. The fragrance is really overpowering and doesn't smell like rosemary mint at all. If you are sensitive to perfumes dyes etc. this is not the product for you. I think I'll stick with a good conditioner rather than UV protectant. nope not really,Neutral
I dye my hair red which is known for fading super fast. But with this stuff my color lasts twice as long. It also smells so good I don't have to wear perfume! Really Works,Neutral
I purchased this Self Tanner because it claimed NOT-TO-HAVE an odor. Very Untrue!! It still smells like Self Tanner's maybe not as stinky but the smell is still there and interfere's with my perfume. Shame on you Jergens for telling a lie and claiming that there's no odor now because this is simply not true!!!!!!!!!!! Still smells like Tanner,Neutral
I use this to remove make up before using my clarisonic. It gets the job done without irritating or drying out my face. I like it way better than Cetaphil. Its not greasy or perfumey. I like the fact that it contains ceramides and hyalauronic acid...they really make my face feel nice. I also use their am and pm moisturizers and I am very pleased with the whole line. Good and basic....,Neutral
I just got this today in the mail and just finished cleaning my brushes. A little goes a LONG way. No smell to it so your brushes will not be left with a perfume or funky smell. Rinsed out nicely. Will order again. Great product!,great product
Almay Makeup Remover Pads are LEGIT. They're gentle cost effective and just a great all-around product and you can't beat that price. If you have super sensitive skin and can't use anything with perfumes or dyes like me this is your product - will always use! Bonfide,sensitive skin
I just bought this product YESTERDAY but I had to write a review on it today because it is so incredible! I have naturally fair skin with an orangish undertone and slight acne. It states on the back if results aren't as noticeable as desired to reapply it more frequently. So of course little-impatient-me reapplied it around - times that day. The affects were noticeable by doing so and they are incredible!*I took a long shower and washed my face twice and the color didn't wash off (*hint hint* swimming? :D).*In the same light which previously made me look like a zombie I look healthy and in the same light which made me look healthy I look radiant.My acne is less noticeable  and I can continue using this product since it is NON-COMEDOGENIC (doesn't cause acne). It is also oil-free dermatologist-tested and lightweight.*I can ditch coverup (which always made me look even MORE unhealthy!) and wear glittery white eyeliner and not look tacky :D*This product smells better than my designer perfumes! I live in California and this definitely has a sweet beachy smell (but not like seaweed haha) but more like a boardwalk smell on a nice relaxing summer day!*They have a matching body-lotion which smells even better and has light specks of glitter in it :DI had tried fake-tanner before and looked so unnatural but this product gave my skin such a natural sun-kissed look I had never seen on myself before. I can go to the beach now still wearing my sunblock AND have a nice sun-kissed glow!This is one of the best beauty products I have found in a long while!I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a slight boost in color but not a strong tan :D LOOKED LIKE I JUST CRAWLED OUT OF NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD,Neutral
I may be in the minority on this one but here's my experience.I am trying to go the route of natural or organic products and loved the idea of this one.Unfortunately it didn't work well for me.It irritated my face so that it turned red felt itchy and looked greasy.I couldn't wait until night to wash the stuff off which I'm pretty sure is not the intent of any day moisturizer.It smells in my opinion like old lady perfume.  It's too fragrant and is a bit obnoxious.The fragrance hung around me all day.Manufacturer:  You have a great idea but please tweak some of your ingredients.  Please cut down on the perfume and if possible please cut out the inflammatory ingredients.  I will then try your product again.Hope this is helpful. Unfortunately Did Not Work Well For Me...,Neutral
it makes my skin so soft after having a showerand it lasts for along time . everyone who touch my skin ask me why i am so soft .. it also make my mother's skin softer and brighter yea i don't like its smell but i can handle it by using arabic ood ..or any perfumes.. and i have been using it for  months i love it,Neutral
I gave this a five star rating because it is a wonderful perfume with a nice soft scent yet somewhat sensuous.  I have used this perfume for a couple of years and was very happy to find it available on Amazon.  I will definitely place another order in the future! I love this perfume,Neutral
I am giving this perfume a  star review because it smells EXACTLY like Tuscanny per Donna which I used to wear years ago.  My mom just bought this scent and I always sample all of her new perfumes and I was FLOORED when I sprayed this on.  I had to look and see if Tuscanny was actually discontinued because this perfume smells EXACTLY like it!  Tuscanny is still available which is odd because they smell so much alike.  However I love Tuscanny and I love this one and to the reviewer who said that it evaporated within a very short time I sprayed a small spritz of this at lunchtime on my wrist and it's now almost quitting time and I still smell it going strong.  Everyone's chemistry is different...it will smell and last differently on each individual who uses it. The same as Tuscanny but another name??,Neutral
This perfume is above and beyond wonderful!  I have never really been into Estee Lauder before thinking it was more for older women but after trying a sample of this perfume I knew I had to buy it.  The amber undertones are soft and lasts for hours.  A perfect perfume for any woman who wants to smell like a lady - day or night you cannot go wrong with this perfume. AMAZING,Neutral
My favorite cologne is Burberry Brit and this smells like a lighter sweeter version without being too sweet. I wear it for my day to day perfume. really nice scent,Neutral
If you want or like attention buy this! Women always ask me what I'm wearing and men go crazy when I walk by. The scent stays on and I can't keep my mom away from the bottle! I highly recommend. The best perfume ever!,Neutral
I love the peachy-sweet notes in this perfume and tbe white florals are wonderful. I suspect that the one-star reviewer who may have ordered the wrong Usher scent may likee the first one bettter.  This one's great in my book! Very Good,Neutral
I bought this just to see. I was pleasantly surprised. It's now my go to perfume. If you haven't tried it you need to. It's really a great perfume. Great find,Neutral
For those who like fragrances such as Joy perfume this is a much less expensive option as it is a similar type of fragrance & long lasting. Will buy again UR Perfume,Neutral
Nautica Classic has a fresh smell to it a little soapy at first but then fades out clean and fresh. It is excellent for mornings or when at home and feeling like wearing a fresh cologne... It lasts alright not strong not weak and overall is alright and i use it just to alternate with at casual uses so you don't have to use up your more expensive designer perfumes... i will not buy again however as i am not that impressed by it. Fresh smell,Neutral
This cologne smells great but does not mix well with cigarette smoke and sweat as I could imagine no cologne or perfume would. However my husband is a cigarette smoker that uses this cologne to cover up the smell and it makes me want to throw the cologne out the window. Other than that this cologne would smell really great Great Smell If You're Not A Smoker,Neutral
I bought this Nautica CLASSIC EDT SPRAY and I spread it into my neck and asked my friends what they think about the scent of it. We all agreed that this would be a wonderful gift for men who were over  years old. This is not a young person cologne but mature man. My father is  years old and it would be a good gift for him.The scent is awesome that is why it is called classic. I prefer to use Paco Rabanne and other brands as a young person not this perfume. I suggest it to everyone but if you are a young person you should search other brands. excellent for mature men,Neutral
i have been using it for the last  months and feel this is very soft in terms smell and a good one that could be used for all occasions. if you are kind of someone who like strong perfumes then this is not for you. this smell soft and gentle. really classic perfume for men. It stays long.,Neutral
This is a great buy. You will not be disappointed.If you want compliments this perfume will definitely give you plenty. It starts out with a powdery scent and then you start to smell a sweet scent. The powdery scent doesn't disappear after you start smelling the sweet scent and the sweet scent isn't overbearing either. Both compliment each other. You don't have to use a lot either and it lasts. Also the price is great for a .oz bottle of good scented perfume. LOVE LOVE LOVE,Neutral
I've NEVER in my life have smelled such a perfect creamy sweet romantic sexy perfume---all in one--until I smelled THIS.OMG...do not be fooled--MEN LOVE THIS..and of course most women. Some women do not like overly sweet scents (like Aquolina-Pink Sugar--although I love that one too--but not as much as this)..something about the sweet pears mixed with vanilla and caramel..smells like a cupcake with such perfection. I hope this NEVER gets discontinued. Jessica did a great job--even tho her Dessert line was a FABULOUS IDEA..but sadly her scents she sold with those didn't last one bit--even tho they smelled to DIE FOR.This hit it on the nail..and I don't know one man who DOESNT like this perfume. It's sweet without being overly sweet. It's sexy..and OMG...it LASTS ALL DAY LONG!!!!!!!!THIS is my favorite perfume in the whole world (so far)..:)Buy this..and you will smell yourself all day long in a happy sweet vanilla bliss of a soft dessert. :) MEN----LOVE-----THIS,favorite perfume
One of my favorite perfumes for work and play! A sweet girly fragrance that I always get compliments when wearing! Sweet girly and smells great!,Neutral
Fancy has the most wonderful scent.  The frangrance puts me in the mind of vanilla jasmine and maybe a little sandalwood.  It is pleasant not too strong yet people can smell the fragrance even when the one wearing it can not.  The perfume lasts for hours. I recommend this perfume for young or middle-aged professional women.  It is not for older women (andup)or pre-teens. Lovely Fragrance for Modern Women,Neutral
It could last a little longer and I don't particularly care for Jessica Simpson but every time I wear this someone asks me what I'm wearing.  More than any other perfume I own.  The next as far as comments would be Lucky You.  It does seem to fade away in a few hours(edp) but it smells so good I don't even care!  It's like cotton candy and vanilla but it's not loaded down with musk (yuk) and it's not too candy/girly sweet smelling.  I get even more of a reaction when I put Victoria's Secret Candy Baby (a little more sweet smelling but very light) body spray on with it.  Enjoy!  :)  HeatherHeather UpChurchArt & Design Studios[...][...] LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,Neutral
When I opened my packageit waswell packaged and super fast delivery by sellerI was greatly pleased that my package arrived in good conditionnd to top it the perfume smell greatits sweet but not overly sweet like candyI love the flowery and subtle vanilla note so it makes it a little sophisticated.I love this perfume and the price on amazon is far better than instores.I got a lot of compliments and people wanted to know the name of perfume I was wearing.Am happy I bought this perfume. stars for jessica simpsonone of the best celebrity perfumes I think !! SWEET,Neutral
This Perfume is certainly different but not in a good way. It's an acquired taste but the scent just never grew on me. The more I smelled it the more I hated it.The combination of Toasted AlmondsRed berriesCaramel and Apricots does not work. It gives off a very oddsynthetic scent.The fruity notes are overpowered by the Toasted Almonds and Burnt Sugar Scent :( Very Different,Neutral
I bought this fragrant for myself for mother's day. I glad I did  thank you Jessica for delivery on this perfum. The perfume last all day and sure to get you notice because people will be givng you compliment left and right. The scent is a floral scent witha  lilac under tone. This is one of my favorite purfum and I will be giving these as gifts for christmas.  Please  give  it a try will love it and the scent is great for all age ranges young as  and old as . You will feel fancy,Neutral
Great perfume. Everything was packaged properly and it smells SO GOOD. I absolutely love it. This is eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping & I clicked that option. That's approximately - days. I purchased this item on April th and I received it on April th. You do the math. Overall its a great product and its a great price. Couldn't ask for anything better. Love It ! !,great product
Ive bought this perfume before and like it. To me it smells like vanilla and lemons. Overall the comment I get is...it smells sweet. So if your not into sweet scents I wouldnt recommend this one. SWEET SCENT,Neutral
I really do enjoy this perfume but it's VERY strong.  Just one spritz lasts all day and is almost too strong at times.  It's lovely but do keep that in mind!  I don't usually buy celebrity perfumes but I love having this one in my collection for winter. Beautiful scent but very strong!,Neutral
There is no reason to spend extra money on expensive name brand perfumes when you have this perfume offered at such a reasonable price in comparison.  Paying extra is not worth it unless you just have to have a name brand perfume sitting on your dresser. Even so this heavy glass perfume container will still rival the expensive brands. Wonderful Fragrance - Best Ever - Regardless of Price,Neutral
My Jessica Simpson perfume arrived today and I am In Love!!! I love how expensive this perfume bottle looks!..She def gave it the right name...It's def Fancy in every way!.. It looks and smells like it should cost  or x's more than what it costs! I love this smell and bottle so much so that I'm going to order at least  more bottles!..I've always been a fan of Jessica's and now I'm even more impressed with her!. ~This Smell Is So Intoxicating!~,Neutral
I really like this perfume. To me it smells like a much more toned-town (daytime) version of Benefit's Something About Sofia and that is my favorite scent of all time! Fancy smells very fresh clean and kind of floral. Very sweet delicate fragrance for daytime,Neutral
i bought this perfume for my self  because it had alot of good reviews but  when i smell it i hated the smell dont like it at all i had to give it away not buying this one again jessica simpson perfume,Neutral
I bought this fragrance blindly based on the reviews & descriptions. I do not regret my choice at all! This scent is so sticky sweet & sugary. I would describe it as a cotton candy/vanilla/caramel scent almost smelling like a sugar cookie at times. The fruits hide out in the background but peek out here & there throughout the day. The caramel/vanilla clings on me the most & lasts almost all day! I applied  sprays this morning one on my neck & one on my wrists which i rubbed on my shirt as well to test the holding power. It's still going pretty strong over  hours later! If you do not like sugary sweet fragrances however you should stray away from this one as it is sweet enough to give you a toothache...lol. I would compare this scent to Can Can by Paris Hilton which is another one of my favorite scents. The only difference i can smell is that this perfume has a more powerful element of vanilla which could be attributed to the caramel as well. I've never smelled Aqualina Pink Sugar but from the description I believe this may smell similar to it as well but also with a possible stronger vanilla note. If you have a craving for sweets this perfume is for you...it'll be sure to satisfy! Super sweet sugary goodness!,Neutral
This fragrance smells so beautiful its unreal. It is one of my favorites by far. One thing that is imperative to being known as a good perfume is endurance and this one lasts for like  days no lie lol! I woke up the next morning and could still smell it on me which made me not even want to take a shower cause I'm like I still smell good lol but of course I did shower folks. All I gotta say is if you are looking for something sweet and sultry not too much but just enough to let people know you are in the room this is the one. I am a fragranceaholic and out of all the ones I have this is one I get quite a few compliments on. A must have!!!!! Beautiful!!!!!!!,Neutral
I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE THIS PERFUME! IT IS MY FAVORITE PERFUME OUT THERE... AND AS WE KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT ONES. THIS WAS IS THE &#;VERY&#; BEST OF ALL THOUGH (WELL FOR ME ANYWAYS). THERE ISN'T A TIME WHEN I WEAR THIS SMELL THAT I DO NOT GET A COMPILMENT FROM SOMEONE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL. IT WAS SHIPPED WHEN IT SAID IT WOULD TOO. I RECOMMEND AND I GIVE IT  STARS. MY FAV &#;FANCY&#; BY JESSICA SIMPSON,favorite perfume
I love this scent.  It is light and perfect for Spring/Summer.  On me it lasts about  hours.  Highly recommend. Fruity Florial Perfume,Neutral
very happy to see this stuff on Amazon. hard to find in stores. great price. I get so many compliments (from random men) on how great this stuff smells! :) favorite perfume!,favorite perfume
I love this perfume it's a big bottle . oz. and I got it on sale too. It smells like toasted almondsvanillacupcakesmaybe jasmine flowerstangerines. Fancy By Jessica Simpson,Neutral
Instead of the sweet caramel vanilla notes everyone else notices I get a sort of rotten fruit odour something sweet but with an unpleasant sour chemical note that I just can't stand.  All of Jessica Simpson's perfumes seem to do this on me (which is a shame as I also have and really wanted to loveFancy Nights By Jessica Simpson Eau De Parfum Spray for Women .-Fluid Ounce)  It's a shame because the bottle is so pretty and it sounds like it's great on other people. This just does not work on my skin,Neutral
I am loving this perfume! When I first sprayed it on I liked it but wasn't sure it lived up to all the hype I read about it. Then after a few minutes as it dried it kept getting better and better! I can definitely smell the caramel and vanilla in it that others have described. It smells so wonderful! I've had it on for almost  hours now and it's still smelling good without being too over powering or strong. I would describe this perfume as very pretty feminine elegant and classy. I also think it's versatile and can be worn pretty much anytime and anywhere. The packaging is also really nice! The bottle is just so pretty and elegant looking. It looks great sitting on my dresser too and just overall makes me happy :) Highly recommended! Loving It!,Neutral
I bought this perfume because it was cheap and Amazon recommended it to me because I love Britney Spears' perfumes. Except I think this one might be better. It stayed on for most of the day was not overpowering and was a sweet youthful scent. Wow! Surprised!,Neutral
I love the smell of this perfume! Its feminine and not too strong - just the right amount for someone that wants to be noticed! I would be happy to get this as a gift every single year :) Favorite of all time!,Neutral
JUST GOT it TODAY.....LOVE IT!!!! I bought it for more than the price shown are the kidding me???The perfume is pretty sweet (just right) long-lasting not overpowering very pleasant when I say 'sweet' it's like flowers with an hint of a -sugar sandalwood- smell that just is REALLY PLEASANT!!! Not A cheaply perfume it seems there was allot of care and thought into the product.I am telling you if you love having a collection of perfume next to your expensive fragrances this one is a keep-sake to go with the others!!This is a beauty and a winner the bottle and box is very well packaged and has a very nice color. The perfume itself has a dark color to it it is not a cheaply white clear liquid fragrance and it applies on the skin as a real perfume not a alcoholic substance that dissipates. A MUST BUY NOW MY SISTER WANTS ONE and she's all about brand names and high-end stuff....so hey what are you waiting for??? BUY IT!!!!! Beautiful perfume!!!!!!!,Neutral
I bought this perfume about a year ago and absolutely hated it. I'm very surprised it got so many good reviews!! It has a very cheap scent it smells like a perfume they would sell at a dollar store. Also the scent does NOT last. I literally sprayed it on myself and within an hour the scent was gone completely. This is one of those you get what you pay for items and I would NOT recommend it. scent doesn't last!!,Neutral
My sister introduced me to this scent and I always thought it smelled nice on her and was impressed how long the scent lasted. So I bought myself a bottle and am now a huge fan! My ex told me the first thing he noticed about me was how good I smelled so I can thank Jessica Simpson for that! Even the barista at a little coffee shop I go to has complimented this scent and asked what I always wear. It lasts throughout the day especially when I spray it on my hair and clothes. I'll put on a sweater that I wore a week ago and it will still smell like this scent.This is definitely the best of all of Jessica Simpson's perfumes! LOVE this scent!!,Neutral
I love this perfume! It smells very sweet and sexy. My husband loves it and thinks I smell like a carnival. I wear this perfume all the time. It's my favorite perfume.You can't beat the Amazon price either. I highly recommend! Wonderful Perfume!,Neutral
This perfume smells amazing! It is so soft and pretty! Its smells really sweet.i pick up vanillacaramel and almost like a cake batter scent.this smells very expensive! This and Jennifer Lopez Still smell wonderful! Fancy nights was terrible! I like this one better. smells great!,Neutral
I love this perfume. I can't really describe the smell but I can say that this fragrance has lasting power which can be a problem with some less expensive perfumes. I spray this on in the morning and I can still smell it when I get ready to shower at night. Fancy!,Neutral
This perfume smells great and lingers all throughout the day. The price is also very affordable. The company also shipped the order on time and with the order I received free samples of other items. Will be ordering more! A Great Smelling Perfume!,Neutral
never have tried it lately but I love it and the price is the greatest and it arrived all in one piece and here fast  thanks perfume,Neutral
it smells like my grand mom's old perfume.not for teenagers or young girls :D you can buy &#;Hilton&#; as a gift to your grand mom :)) puke :D,Neutral
*** UPDATE: After wearing this all summer my husband thinks it is about the best thing ever! And I do like it better than Just Me It does take time for this to warm up on the body. It takes on a sensual floral with the PeonyPeach Nectar and Cashmere Musk making their appearance with just a touch of warm vanilla and it still has just a hint of sparkle from the sparkling prosecco accord. However it does take more than one spritz to get the full effect. I actually load myself with it and my husband can't stay away from me. I really do like this fragrance now. I hope others will give it a chance and not be sidetracked by the name. I think Summer Dream would have been a better name for it than Fairy Dust! but then that's just me!My old review is below:This smells almost like a perfume I used in High school called Heaven Scent about a million years ago. The only thing is this is much lighter. For the cost it is just so so. I gave it  stars for the bottle.I like Paris Hilton's Just Me much better. Paris Hilton Fairy Dust,Neutral
I bought this perfume as a gift to myself for mother's day.  The box as well as the perfume bottle is beautiful. The scent is powdery and sweet with a lily under tone. I always get alot of  compliments when I wear this perfume. Although this perfume smells great  I think it is more suited for teenager and early twenty year old. By all means still get it it is nice fragrant. sweet smell,Neutral
I'm also not a Paris Hilton fan sorry..but this perfume is amazing. I fell in love with it instantly. By far this isn't a cheap perfume but I would certainly grab this one at this price. The smell was still on me the next day. It lasts and lasts and I only use a spray on my neck and my wrists and that is it. This will last a long time and the scent lasts a long time. It is a sweet floral at st and as it changes it is such a lovely smell.  I wish I could explain the smell better but the change of scent as your wearing it mellows to a pretty flowery scent with a little something that pops. Totally awesome and I truly love it. Not for the shy. Little goes a long way.  It is one of my favorites now.  The service I received was  star all the way.  I ordered  perfumes that day and I got some free samples as well which I haven't tried yet but sure will.  I love the way it was packaged and the surprises made me happy. Excellent service and products. SURPRISING AND WONDERFUL,long way
LOVE this perfume!:) Smells so good and is long lasting plus its showed up brand new! Very pleased! I would recommend this to all women!;) Paris Hilton perfume,Neutral
IT IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SMELLS IN A PERFUME! IT WAS A GOOD PRICE AND IT WAS SHIPPED OUT TO ME WHEN IT SAID IT WOULD. I GIVE IT  STARS AND  THUMBS UP! FAIRY DUST BY &#;PARIS&#;,Neutral
I bought two as presents and it smells OK - for the price I paid it's a nice gift it's a second perfume I tried from Paris Hilton (first one was tease)  and yep... well done Paris :)Nice floral scent. can be used from spring to summer... It's OK,Neutral
I LOVE Paris's first perfume (no clue what it's called maybe just Paris Hilton..) so I was hoping to like this one too..I was wrong. To make a long review short and save you some time I'll just say this: It smells like old lady. Save your money and buy ANY of Britney Spears' perfumes or Jessica Simpson's line or if you are the kind of person who loves buying blood diamonds and poached ivory products buy some of Justin Bieber's perfumes. His perfumes smell great and have staying power but every time I spray them on a little part of me dies... Yuck,Neutral
It last a long time on me strong smell at first but it dry down it smell wow and last for a long time until the next day I still smell it a great bye womens This perfume smell great,long time
This perfume smells fabulously floral and clean on me.  It has notes of jasmine I believe and smells to me like clean cool night air with a waft of fresh flowers and unlike many celebrity perfumes it has staying power.  I put some on at around  PM yesterday and at  AM today the lovely floral bouquet still lingers on my wrists and neck (which after a long car trip doctors appointment and lots of hand washing and cooking is pretty impressive). The bottle isn't as pretty as say Katy Perry's killer queen and certainly does not rival the elegance of my beloved Shalimar but it's nice enough and the scent is amazing. Fabulous Clean Floral,Neutral
I have to say that I really love this perfume. If you like Tuberose (and I do!) then this one's for you. It lasts a good amount of time too with a lovely wafting sillage. The dry down is just as marvelous smelling as the first spray. The bottle is also simply lovely etched with the design of a fairy holding a wand. The price makes this a steal and a great buy! Tuberose Heaven,Neutral
Several of the gals (including my mother and daughter) received this perfume for Christmas this year. This perfume has a pleasing light scent (if you don't lay it on too thick!) that I liked very much when I tested it out in the store. All of the ladies liked it too and the price on amazon just killed all other competitors so I ordered several. Not disappointed in the slightest! Picked up several of these for family members this year at Christmas time. Nice light feminine scent!,Neutral
But besides that... At first when i got this (And btw i got this without even knowing what it smelled like lol DURP i just saw good reviews) I sprayed it and i was all like ughhh ew it smells like perfume my g-ma would wear... But then i waited and smelled it some more and then i was all like zomg this actually does smell purty darn gonnit delish... So i guess what i'm trying to say is... yeah this is a good perfume. I just hate Paris Hilton. She bad. Kbye :D Paris Should Put Some Clothes On...,Neutral
I purchased this for my niece.  It's a young girl scent.  Not bad for Paris Hilton!  I was actually surprised at how well it smelt.  It's an okay perfume.  I've smelt better but for a young girl this is nice.  The box is a little inappropriate though with Paris almost half naked.  What can we expect right? For a Young Girl,Neutral
This perfume is so far one of the best i've ever got. It has a strong smell but at the same time it is elegant and it lasts all day long. You can wear it day or night. Enchanting fragrance,Neutral
Love the fragrance. Its fresh and very feminine. It's my goto perfume! It's on the expensive side but worth every penny! Love it,Neutral
I loved this perfume and got many compliments from it. It had been my signature perfume for years but I think it is about time to switch because no one notices or cares or says anything anymore. So... dare to be different. Good But Maybe Getting Old,Neutral
Smells great.  Bottle is so pretty.  I collect perfume bottles but the one thing the perfume itself have to smell good and this one smells great Luscious Pink,Neutral
I actually tried this fragrance by the five-octave diva and it was really good. I usually despise celeb scents (except Glo by- ugh- JLO which is a nice soapy little scent). Although it worried me at first with a hint of bubblegum (omg omg) it dried down to a delicious AWL THAT cashmere.Very Nice. I still would have to pour the bottle into a flacon or something I'd die before I'd let someone see this or Lady Gaga or whatever on my dressing table. I mean that's for teenagers. Be a grown-up if you get this pour it into a nice atomizer or one of those gorgeous glass perfume bottles they sell. What does Mariah Smell Like? Fabulous Evidently.,Neutral
This perfume smells goodbut has no staying power.  I won't order again. pretty bottle it will look nice on my dresser. where did it go,Neutral
I'm sure there's cheaper soaps out there but this soap is one of the better ones I've come across. It has essential oils and leaves the skin smelling natural and nice. I use it in the kitchen and when I eat I don't taste detergent or perfume on my hands. It doesn't leave residue or dry the skin out.To make it more economical I dilute it and put it in one of the foaming dispensers. It's Like a Luxury Soap,dry skin
I love this brand of BB creams. I have very light porcelain skin and this matches my skin very well. I also have oily/combination skin and it controls my oil better than regular foundation does. This BB cream has minor coverage but feels very light on my skin. It smells REALLY good like a light floral perfume and not overbearing. The oil control isn't great but if you put oil control powder over it it works really well. It also has a light shimmer to it as well but not crazy noticeable. Overall this is a good BB cream for people with light to medium skin who needs minor coverage. SKIN The Prestige BB Cream Diamond,Neutral
When i blindly bought this onei trusted YSLbut later regretted coz its way too sweetalmost like a womens fragrance.The dry down is kinda powdery in its smell and reminds me of some cheap unisex frgrance.Eventhough i really didn't like it in the beginningas i reused it after couple of monthsfelt it isn't  that bad as i thought.But if you looking for something very strong mens perfume having leather/tobaccothen you are on the wrong end.I wouldn't quite recommed it . too feminine........too sweet,Neutral
I purchased these to use for an ostomy patient in cleaning the stoma area.  They are quite large x so I cut them into thirds which give us three clean passes on the clean-up.  They are strong and do not fall apart yet very soft.It is useful to have what is basically a personal cleaning wipe without perfume or soaps.They came in ten individual packages of  each. Great disposable cloth,Neutral
Dudu Osun smell like perfume. But the best part about this soap not speaking for all skin types but for my extra dry skin it really helps softens and lighten the Skin up. Thank God for it. Great Soap,dry skin
There is a very specific problem with this otherwise wonderful product: the added fragrance. Fragrance/perfume is a horrific irritant for sensitive skin and is an absolute breeder of Eczema and Rosacea. IF (!!!) you are NOT a the very least sensitive regarding added perfumes then this product may do wonders for you. But if like me you are sensitive this will DESTROY your skin regardless of the hypoallergenic moisturizers you use.On a positive note this is extremely good at clearing blackheads -- amazingly so actually! However my entire body quickly became an eczema and rosacea covered mess so I'm not sure if it's worth-it.As other reviewers have noted DEFINITELY use a moisturizer with this soap! It is very drying!I just wish they didn't add so much fragrance -- not only does it smell disgusting (think cheap tropical-scented bathroom freshener!) but it destroys sensitive skin. Awful for Eczema and Rosace,sensitive skin
I'm a product junkie. I noticed a new product on one of my favorite websites and just had to try it. However it was $ for less than -oz. plus it contained a perfumed essence.  I decided to give this a try and am glad I did. It's % natural marula oil. I use it on my face hands and hair. It's not too heavy absorbs quickly. There's no unpleasant odor. I apply it to my face at bedtime. When I wake up my face is still soft and supple. Since it's not greasy or shiny once absorbed I sometimes use it in the morning as a moisturizer under my sunscreen. The order arrived in great shape within two days! Great Price. Good Product.,Neutral
I use this as my night cream and in the morning I wake up with such hydrated healthy firm and plump looking skin!  I do combine this with the Clarant B (normal-to-oily version - which is very light formula) to get both the spot-correcting and wrinkle-fighting benefits.  It's really working!  My skin just looks clearer and smoother than it has ever been.  I'm really glad I gave Pond's a try a few months ago - now I'm hooked for life.  What's even better is that it is so affordable and the jar is huge!  It has performed as well or better than the department store brands I have used in the past.  The only thing is the smell is quite perfume-y so it may bother those with fragrance allergies.  The results have been so positive that I associate the fragrance with comfort.  My skin drinks it up and I look glowing! Amazing Cream!,Neutral
I'll just start by saying that I've used a lot of moisturizers and although I've used both department store and drug store brands I have never found one that I felt was worth using religiously. That said I really like this cream and I think it is superior to most of the other brands I have tried (actually I think it is also superior to other pond's products too). I wasn't really expecting much but within a couple of days of using it I noticed that my skin looked rehydrated sort of filled in and the bags under my eyes were substantially less noticeable--yay! I've been using it for about two weeks now and I can't imagine not wanting to continue using it as my results have only gotten better. I'd like to explain the four star rating: I gave four stars because although I don't find the smell offensive in any way it is unusually strong strong enough to clash with perfumes and body sprays but that is pretty much my only gripe. I recommend this product for sure! Great Product for the Price,great product
I'm pale. Pale pale pale pale. Super fair skin. My grandfather always used to joke that I looked like Casper the Ghost when I wore shorts. When I first tried this tanner I decided to go crazy with it. I put it everywhere and rubbed it in really really really good. To my horror despite rubbing it in for  minutes straight it dried looking orange and streaky. Not to mention it felt sticky. I always keep some makeup remover wipes on hand so I can quickly remove the tanner from around my ankles backs of my knees wrists and hands. Instead I took my makeup remover wipes and wiped off all the orange streaks and a massive amount of glitter. I went to bed.....the next day I woke up and looked at my legs. Oh my goodness I am tan. My milk white skin is TAN! No streaks just beautiful tan goodness. I've decided that the formula is only orangey brown to give an idea of where I'm putting it and what areas I've covered. It will look streaky when I first put it on. It will dry sticky smell like soapy perfume but all of that washes away with a good shower. All that is left behind is a beautiful tan.My suggestion: Tie your hair up strip naked and use this on the morning of your day off when you are lounging around the house. Pay the orange streaks no mind. Let it get semi-dry (where the orange streaks stick to your skin and don't move around easily) and put on some clothes that you don't care about getting stained. If you rubbed tanner into your butt wear a loose skirt and skip the underwear. Then go about your cleaning cooking TV watching video games whatever. In the evening take a shower. Use some soap and gently wash your skin. Get all of the orange streaks off. Use some rubbing alcohol on any areas that were accidentally tanned.....Voila! A gorgeous natural looking tan!I only wish L'Oreal would make a version without glitter. The cure for pale,Neutral
This is great stuff.  I've been using regular drugstore deodorants - Secret Lady Speed Stick etc. - but nothing gives me really great protection on days I exert myself doing yardwork or going to my fitness center (just a -minute session on an ellyptical and a few machines - I'm not so active that this is a very strong test of anything).  I bought the Lavanila thinking I'd use it for special occasions since it matches the scent I use - but quickly found it's much more effective than anything else I've tried.It's also less irritating - no more itching.  And the scent is very light even after a workout - nothing that seems to be noticeable to anyone else at the fitness center I use.  (I hate strong perfume smells myself and don't want to offend others this way.)I'm now using it every day.  More expensive but definitely worth it. Works better than anything else I've tried - and much less irritating too,Neutral
I wanted to try this BB cream because of the SPF coverage the reviews I've read the comments I've heard from people about BB creams etc. I was insanely disapointed with this BB cream. Not only did this cream NOT give me much coverage it smelled rancid of cheap perfume and left this shinny look to my face that I hated. It did NOT set smoothly at all either but left my face feeling overly heavy oily and super shiney. Just NO! This product only got  stars for  reasons- : fast shipping and : The bottle design is a great concept. What the heck is with the smell?,Neutral
This gave me huge cystic acne. I have semi-sensitive skin but nothing has broken me out like this and I've use all brands and types of makeup Also I'm not smell-sensitive but this smell is just awful. Really smells like an old woman's perfume. Pore clogging bad smell,Neutral
It came super fast and packaging was great.I'm Asian-American so finding a good foundation (light/medium with yellow undertone skin)was really hard. I'm  and suffer from cystic acne hyperpigmentation (dark splotches) oily-combination and general redness. I used to take acne antibiotics but eventually that even stopped working so I was pretty much resigned to terrible skin for the rest of my life. Since I've been using BB Cream ( I started with Cliniques it was okish) I only get a pimple once in a while and the condition minus makeup is superb. With the cream I look flawless. I haven't looked this good since before having children!!There is a slight perfume smell (I like it) that quickly dissolves and I've found that it's really matte. I have a super oily T zone but not when using this. I don't even need the oil papers as much and I hardly need powder. In fact I sometimes need an extra moisturizer because it zaps oil so much (at least for me). This color is a little weird until I rub into my skin and it may be slightly too pale for me so I may go to the next level but that's my error not the products.Overall I'm really satisfied. It breaths well and I never feel like rushing to wash it off actually I quite forget that it's there. Worth a try. Definitely better than other foundations. So far so good!,Neutral
I was very pleased when this deodorant arrived. The scent was quite pleasing without being so overwhelming with perfume. A real plus is that the ingredients are all natural as well. Okay this may not get you through a workout but other than that the smell lasts and no need for any reapplying. No stains on your clothing and no burning after shaving your under arms oh yes because there's no alcohol in this! Great price too because you'd pay more at your local drugstore Target or even Wal-Mart. I am glad I bought this and to know that it's animal free makes it all worth it! Smells good works good,Neutral
I had been using Burt's Bees herbal deodorant because I wanted something that wasn't toxic to my body...but I still wanted to not stink!  I really liked it but for some reason it stopped working for me.  So since I wanted to try something else that would work better I searched around on Amazon and found this gem.  First of all I was never a fan of roll on deodorant but I wanted to give it a try since the reviews were great.  I am so impressed!  The pomegranate scent is not over powering...it's actually very pleasant.  The scent wears off for the most part so I never had to worry about it clashing with my natural perfume oil I wear.  This deodorant works all day for me....and I wouldn't say I am a super active person.  But there are moments that I am really glad I'm wearing a good deodorant because let's face it...I live in Texas...everyone sweats here!  I'm giving this  stars!  I can't wait to try the other scents too! It's the best I've tried yet!,Neutral
I was surprised how well these deodorants work! I love using it with sleeveless shirts cause it doesn't leave white stuff all over them like other deodorants. I tried this one and chamomile/ green tea one. I prefer the smell if the orange one. This one  despite my love if lavender at least to me ends up smelling like sweat after awhile but once I reapply I'm OK. I love the orange one better. I want to try pomegranate. I haven't tried perfume free one yet. good protection doesn't stain clothes smell ok,Neutral
...This Lotion Gave Me A Headache!I admit to being sensitive to smells.  Walking into a department store with a perfume counter or into candle shops where the scents are many and they mingle makes me a little sick.  I get a headache and then I get queasy.  This lotion had that same effect it's very florally and that is one of the scents that I have the hardest time with.The lotion itself is supple and it went on so smooth and light I loved the texture.  It didn't leave my skin feeling caked or oily just soft and silky.  Because of the quality of the lotion itself I tried to use it  more times unfortunately the smell still gave me a headache.I would definitely try this product in an unscented version as I do think the lotion was great. If it was for the lotion alone I probably would have rated it a .Cherise Everhard October  Like The Perfume Counter At Macy's...,Neutral
Moisturizing is a good thing - one of the few things one can do to keep skin looking young and healthy. To be fair almost any moisturizing lotion will do the trick; but the two flavors of Vaseline Sheer Infusion that I tried out add a bit of luxury to the process mainly in their silken feel and making the skin feel comfortably moist. The fragrance is not overwhelming leaning more toward the fresh smells of nature than of perfume albeit still a bit artificial--I'd really rather do without scent altogether. In spite of the presence of eucalyptus and cypress bark in the botanical-blend version I could not discern much difference in the scent between the two; and the two versions share the same list of most active ingredients. If you're a fan of natural products I'd suggest the botanical-blend; the mineral renewal formula doesn't seem to have much to distinguish it other than mineral water (which could mean almost anything).After using this product over an extended time since my initial review I can add that it actually seems to have smoothed my skin and given it a healthier feel especially my face. I have found however that the lotion is just oily enough to cause some stickiness on legs and arms; so that I am finding its best use is not as a body lotion as it is billed but more so as a face cream. Silken & effective,Neutral
With winter on the way I was interested in getting this product. And as with many women I find I have amassed a rather large collection of lotions and creams in pursuit of that perfect skin treat.Lotions and creams like perfume are a very personal choice with each person having a different idea of what is perfect. I found the smell of this particular product to be absolutely overwhelming and truly awful. Yet as I glanced at other reviews of the product I seem to be a small minority with this complaint. I also noticed most reviewers felt it was a light easily absorbed lotion. I found it to be rather greasy and it didn't really sink into my skin.I've used several other Vaseline lotions and had good results. Evidently the Botanical Blend and my skin don't mesh! Alas nothing special.,Neutral
I love body lotions and oils.  I have dry skin and after a shower I always apply something to make sure my skin doesn't feel tight and scratchy.  This Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion smoothes on beautifully and doesn't feel greasy afterwards.  But it leaves my skin with a soft kind of glowy look.  I especially like the fragrance.  It's floral and a little like a fresh-cut lawn but very subtle.  If I take a shower at night and put on this lotion then by morning I can still wear a perfume and the scents do not clash.This lotion gives me the same lasting penetrating feeling of soft skin as dry oil spray-ons which I also love but which often come in scents which are quite heavy and overwhelming.Overall highly recommended.  I will purchase this product again. Lovely light floral scent and non-greasy feeling,dry skin
Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Botanical Blend is the newest release in the Vaseline Intensive Care family of moisturizers.  The major claim is that their new formula Stratys  provides the best combination of moisturizers on the market leaving your skin hydrated but not sticky.  So what exactly is Stratys ?  A combination of glycerol quat hydroxyethyl urea and glycerin.  Glycerin is hygroscopic meaning it attracts water and glycerol quat is a compound supposed to attract and hold more water than glycerin.  Hydroxyethyl urea sometimes competes with glycerine for moisturizing effectiveness in the cosmetics market but is thought to be less sticky.  Vaseline advertises that this particular trio when used together work better than each works individually.  The advertising kind of dumbs it all down for us by saying it moisturizes the top the core and deep down parts of our skin.  The general idea is to attract and hold water in the skin which this product seems to do.Extra added benefits:  Vitamin B- and Vitamin E.  Both linked with improved moisturizing  but without knowing the amounts added here can't even tell if they are just added fluff or truly in sufficient quantities to do anything.When using it after a shower it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  The leg I've applied it to looks and feels better than the other one immediately and still does at the end of the day.  It has staying power.After using it for a few weeks (and using it on both legs that experiment was annoying) I can say it works as well as any other moisturizer I've tried.  Whether it works better or not might require microscopic examination.The scent is nice and not too feminine.  Guys could use it without smelling girly.  However that said scent is a personal thing and the Botanical Blend has enough of a scent that you should smell it before using it.The downside?  Again back to the scent.  Anyone with allergies or a sensitive nose would not appreciate it.  Also it might compete with your other scents and perfumes.  The addition of parabens (used as preservatives) is sometimes controversial in the cosmetics industry.  They have been linked with breast cancer in women and decreased sperm count in men.  However the amounts in this lotion are extremely small and in my opinion negligible.  But its something to be aware of if it concerns you.Overall?  I like it.  But its not so wonderful that I wouldn't buy a competing product if it were cheaper.  I'm not wholly convinced that it is actually a better product.  But its nice and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. Good moisturizer at a fair price,Neutral
The botanical scent is light and unoffensive but strong enough that you will not be able to wear perfume.  I found a little of this lotion went a long way. It leaves a layer on your skin which I don't like.  You know how you can put on a lotion and it absorbs into your skin and you feel your skin?  This is not that lotion.  You'll feel the lotion.  I feel for a Vaseline product it's pricey and you can get a better lotion for less money and more natural ingredients. Pricey for Vaseline lotion,long way
Vaseline's Sheer Infusion lotion is thick creamy and white and a little translucent.  A small amount covers a lot of skin.  It's not greasy at all but that doesn't mean your skin feels bare. After using it on my hands it takes ten minutes or so before I'm comfortable touching things.The lotion moisturizes well and it lasts.  Using it overnight my skin felt noticeably more soft in the morning.The Botanical Blend has a fairly strong floral perfume added.  The scent faded pretty quickly but it was strong at first.  I liked it fine but people who are sensitive to perfumes will want to avoid this one.I also tried the Mineral Renewal which smells like citrus.  Other than that I didn't notice any difference between the lines at least on initial use. Works well,Neutral
This has a nice scent. And it is listed as a body lotion.  It works as a body lotion but if you tend to also use lotions as a hand lotion this would not be my first choice. It leaves a bit of residue which I  would not recommend for hands.  Water is the first ingredient and glycerin the second so it may provide enough moisture for a day but in dry areas or dry skin it needs re-application. This is a lotion I would not use in warm climates or during high temperatures because of the scent. In hot climates this scent would attract insects. The floral scent lingers light enough not to be overpowering. It smells like most perfumed lotions (think VSC's perfumed lotions).It is not as emollient as another type of Vaseline product. Works  for body not really for hands floral scent,dry skin
I have seriously dry skin and have tried pretty much every lotion out there.  I had tried Vaseline Intensive Care in the past with mixed results.  This is a definite improvement on their old formula.This lotion is nice and thick and seems to soak in well.  It will leave a slick residue on your hands (as did the old VIC lotion). But overall the effect on my skin was good.  It felt softer and reduced any flaky areas (a small miracle).  I was not expecting to like this lotion but I do.The only thing I don't like about the lotion is the strength of the scent. It is a nice enough botanical type scent but it is VERY strong and does not fade over time. Which is bad if you wear perfume etc. Quite a clash!  I am hoping the company puts out an unscented version. Great for Dry Skin!,dry skin
When I received my Amazon newsletter and Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Botanical Blend was on it I wasn't sure that I would want to review it.  I was willing to try it and I am thrilled to note that this lotion is D I V I N E!!My problem areas are my elbows ankles and the heels of my feet. After just one week I can tell a considerable difference in all three areas.  My elbows are not as cracked neither are the heels of my feet.  My ankles are soft and when I scratch my legs they don't turn ashy looking.The light perfumed smell of this botanical 'flavored' lotion is subtle but very pleasing to my nose.  It isn't blatant -- it is more of a reminder that you are able to smell for more than two hours after application.I would recommend this product to anyone!Natalie S. for Amazon Vine LOVELOVELOVE this lotion!,Neutral
This scent is overpowering.  It is not a situation of yes you can tell it's there.  I mean this is a very strong scent.  I would go so far as to call it overwhelming.It is not a bad scent but unless you really like this scent and want to wear it as a perfume substitute it's just too much.As for the lotion itself I found it in line with other vaseline products.  It's not completely sheer it is a touch on the greasy side I would not wear it in summer.  Still if that doesn't matter to you it does do a nice job of keeping skin hydrated.Personally though even if the lotion itself were perfect I would not buy again because it is just too scented. Incredibly Strong Scent!,Neutral
The bad thing about getting items like this through the mail is you have no idea what their scent is like.  You can only guess.  Since this had eucalyptus in it for some reason I thought it was going to have a scent similar to Nozema.  Instead it has a scent similar to shampoos loaded with perfume.  Perfume scents close up my sinuses and often give me headaches.  This one even makes me cough if I smell it directly from the bottle.  That is a shame too because the product works very well!  It would be a true blessing in the winter when electric heat is blasting everywere.  But alas I can only use it on my legs since they are some distance from my head. Terrific Except For The Scent,Neutral
This lotion is quite light but moisturizes very well. It has no strong perfumes that might compete with other fragrances you might where. It is sheer absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all. Great every day moisturizer for body!,Neutral
This lotion is really creamy and does a great job at moisturizing dry skin.  It goes on light but be warned - a little goes a long way! I tend to use half the amount of Vaseline Sheer than I do most other lotions. It is lightly accented in your choice of flavors... I mean scents; but they are not overpowering at all. The botanical blend has alight scent with a mixture of flowers and fruits but not enough that it would clash with your perfume or shower gel. Great moisturizer,long way
The reason I only give VASELINE SHEER INFUSION BODY LOTION: VITAMIN BURST -stars is because the pump was broken. No matter how many times I turned it it never popped up to dispense the lotion so I had to remove the inner-stem and just unscrew the cap each time to use.It's been about  weeks since I started using Vitamin Burst and my skin is well hydrated and soft. My body skin is combination normal/dry--ironic cause my face is the opposite normal/oily--and the dry parts aren't excessively dry so keep that in mind.The lotion has a light-citrus like scent and smells likeJohnson's Body Care  Hour Body Lotion -Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of )but not as strong. You really smell it at first when applying it but it dissipates very fast and it isn't too perfumey.I use it after showering so roughly every other day and it keeps my skin soft and supple without feeling greasy or sticky. It glides on easily and absorbs fast and it hasn't irritated my skin or made me breakout.So VASELINE SHEER INFUSION: VITAMIN BURST is a pretty good body lotion but it doesn't contain a sunscreen. I would have given -stars but that broken pump was not cool. **Light** And **Silky** With Good Moisture Retention...,Neutral
I typically have normal to oily skin so generally use lotions only in the winter. This Vaseline Sheer lotion goes on light and feel surprisingly silky (very nice!). It blends into the skin quickly and doesn't feel sticky. My only complaint is the fragrance. The perfumey smell is rather strong. I'm hoping they'll consider making an unscented version. Silky but can do without scent,Neutral
I absolutely love the feel of this lotion. I've tried other deep-hydrating lotions and they've always left a tacky layer on my skin. Not so with the Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion. My skin absorbs the lotion quickly and stays moisturized throughout the day. My friend who is rather obsessed with lotions tried this product too and has only positive things to say.I'm a person with a lot of allergies and I haven't had any bad reactions to this lotion so far. The only thing I don't like about it is the cheap perfume scent. It's not overbearing (if it was I wouldn't use the lotion) but it's unnecessary so I subtracted a star. I hope they come out with a scent-free option in the future. Excellent lotion (just wish it was scent free),Neutral
I have incredibly dry itchy skin - particularly in the winter. Between the lower humidity in the air and the heat running more my skin begins to look like I have a four-legged reptilian ancestor. I had read about this new lotion and was very curious about how well it might work so I jumped at the chance to give it a try.I have been using the lotion for about  weeks now - certainly a fair amount of time particularly since it often seems to take at least a week for my skin to really settle into a new lotion. I use it once a day - in the evening after my shower. It has no greasy feel and absorbs quite well. Without needing to reapply during the day my skin stays soft and hydrated - no itchy spots or reptile skin. No dry patches or irritation.The only issue I have with the lotion (and it could very well just be this particular flavor - I haven't tried any others) is that the scent is initially fairly strong. Not to the point of making me sick to my stomach (and many overpowering scents can do that) but just...overwhelmingly *there*. It's very similar to when you initially put on perfume - it initially smells strong but fades nicely over time.Overall I highly recommend this lotion. It has worked incredibly well on my poor skin and it's thick or greasy like many others. I fully intend to buy another bottle once this one has been completely used up. My crocodile skin feels great!,Neutral
Sheer Infusion with Stratys  Vitamin Burst body lotion. This lotion is remarkably similiar to the Mineral Renewal. The smell is soft and perfumey.  The lotion makes your skin feel like silk.  The lotion did not irritate my skin and I have extremely sensitive skin.  The lotion is not heavy but it isn't very light either middle of the line I suppose.  I did get the mineral burst too and it was about the same all the way around even down to the smell.  At this point I can't tell the difference between the two lotions down to the smell the feel and the effect on my skin.I would definately consider purchasing from this vaseline line again. Like the Mineral Renewal,sensitive skin
I think the second you pour this into your hand you'll be able to tell by the scent that it's a women's lotion. It smells like cheap imitation brand perfume.I get dry itchy skin so I am willing to try anything even if it's meant for women. I find one product that works and stick with it even if it's meant for the opposite sex. But when Something's free - I'll try anything ButVaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Vitamin Burstisn't all that great. I mean it moisturizes okay despite it's hideous scent. BUT It works the same as all the other lotions I've used. So It's not that terrific.I'm sorry but this Vitamin Burst Didn't improve anything. Vaseline is making it seem like the Burst of vitamins will improve my skin but I don't see a difference between this and the other Vaseline lotions I've used. Which also don't work that well for me.This may sound weird coming from a guy but the only thing I've found to work right isBath & Body Works Body CreamVaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion Vitamin Burstwas worth trying. But for me it smelled terrible and didn't work that well same as all the others,Neutral
I have very dry skin so am skeptical of most claims by moisturizers that they are effective. I purposely waited to use this product until after colder weather set in and central heat was turned on to really test its effectiveness -- that's when dry skin starts to crack and peel. The Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is light and non-greasy but appears to penetrate through the top skin layers fairly weightlessly. It is also fragrance free so its scent isn't overwhelming and doesn't compete with my own perfume. Most important after two weeks of use my skin definitely feels softer and less dry which is nearly miraculous in my experience for a lightweight-feeling body lotion. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of this product. My only real problem with the product was that it was quite difficult to get the pump mechanism to work. However once that was solved it has worked fine and the lotion was definitely worth the wait. light but effective for dry skin,dry skin
I really like this lotion. I cannot detect any scent. I asked my husband to smell it straight out of the bottle and he couldn't smell anything either.  If it is scented its scented so lightly that I cannot detect any scent.  This is fine by me because then it does not interfere with my chosen perfumes and scents.Chef's talk about mouth feel and I want to refer to that because this lotion has a hand feel or smoothness to it that makes you think of slathering on something smooth and creamy into your skin.  The simply texture of it is lovely.  It does not leave a greasy residue or any residue for that matter.  Within ten minutes or so you cannot tell you put any lotion on.  I do not have skin issues no extreme dryness etc.  I am your average lotion user who goes to lotion to relieve the occasional lackluster feel my skin gets from long day's in the heat of Florida.The only suggestion I would make to Vaeline is that they do not print such tiny text on the bottle with such a difficult to read color. I had to strain my otherwise normal eyesight to read what it said on the back.New technology?  Really....it's hard to tell.  It's just a nice unscented non-greasy lotion if you ask me.  All that other hype...who can know? I can't tell. My skin feels the same using this as any other Vaseline product.  Perhaps you have to have some major skin issues to give this product the true test of its abilities.  It has made my skin soft and in the week since I've been using it I have noticed the small bumps on my elbows etc. are gone.  Smooth and soft now.  Thanks for that Vaseline.  I really do like the fact that I can slather it on my feet and within five minutes I can walk across my tile floor and not fall on my behind in a slick trip. (ie: it really soaks in and leaves no grease behind) That's a plus because now I'm using it more on the soles of my feet! :-) I like it,Neutral
I've used a variety of Vaseline lotion products in the past.  My favorite is the Vaseline Intensive Care - Water Resistant Lotion.  Most of the Vaseline lotion products I have used in the past have a light scent to them but nothing overwhelming.  I am a big hand lotion user because I work in a lab wear gloves all day and wash my hands a lot.  I got this lotion through the Amazon Vine program.This lotion leaves your hands very soft initially but washes off easily and doesn't seem to provide any lasting moisturizing effect.  It also absorbs quickly into the skin and comes in a very nice sleek looking bottle with a convenient hand pump.It also has a very strong scent to it.  I don't like strong scents and the scent of this lotion kind of gave me a headache; the scent isn't fruity or flowery but more cloying and perfumey.  I asked my husband to give the lotion a try too; he mentioned that he also hated the smell.  It is a strong scent that is long-lasting.  In fact when he walked into the bedroom after putting lotion on his hands; I was like what is that smell?  He replied; I tried out that stupid lotion :-)  On the flip side I have had a couple people at my work mention that they like the smell of it.  So I guess it is up to personal preference.Overall this is an okay basic lotion.  I probably won't ever buy more of it to use.Positives:- Leaves skin soft- Absorbs quickly- Convenient hand pump- Sleek packagingNegatives:- Washes off easily- No lasting moisturizing or skin improvement seen (over  week of use)- Can leave skin a little sticky- Very strong fragrance Leaves hands soft but strongly scented,Neutral
I had high hopes for this lotion based on other reviews and yes the commercial as well as checking out their website for information about this lotion.We have a child who is allergic to many foods and other things and as a result often breaks out in rashes and we have to keep her skin moisturized in the winter to make sure it stay under control. I have a hard time finding a lotion for her that does not make her itches worse or burn her.  This lotion did not pass her test.First off the smell is way too strong for her as well as myself. We tried a small amount on her skin as soon as we got it and we had to take it off shortly after because it was hurting her skin. So back to the Aveeno we will go for her.Now for myself. I have some skin condition that honestly i do not recall what they told me the name of it it but basically there are times when if i have my  hands in water too much or too hot of water the skin bubbles up and breaks open and then i have to use this steroid cream to get it back under control.I have found that there are a couple lotions i can use to help so it does not get too bad.So i thought maybe I could add this lotion to the list of others that will help my hands even though i know it is more a body lotion I had hoped it would help. I was wrong.I opened it up and tried it right away. Right now my hands are fine so thought perfect time to put it to the test.Right away the smell nearly knocked me over even the kids who were upstairs away from me came down to ask me what was that smell.  It is very much like perfume yes it is a light perfume scent but for those with allergiesto many perfumes and colones i would say stay away from this lotion.I had to wash it off right away because having it on my hands gave me a headache.Now I decided to give it another try the next day because our house is honestly not the norm that most people will experience with this lotion so I wanted to see how it would do on other parts of the body.I used it on skin on bottom of one foot and did like the result but i just can not handle the smell and was silly because i have to keep washing it off my hands and in the process my hands are getting bad again.In fact when I was out and about my friends asked me what PERFUME I was wearing. Even after i washed it off my hands. Explained to them it was not perfume but this lotion instead.Did give the lotion away because it is just too strong smelling and irritating to the highly sensitive skin in this family.Aside from that I do think it works ok as far as mosturizing the skin. I did also notice that you do not need as much as you might be used to when using other lotions. It does have a different feel to it than other lotions we have used so that takes some getting used to.I am going to see if they make an unscented version to try that instead..So if you have any kind of allergies or sensitivity to scents I would be careful with this one might not be the right lotion for you. Cost vale of the lotion seem a little high but does seem like you will use less lotion than you would normally so possible this lotion will last longer than your normal lotion.I am a little hesitant about some of the ingredients as i look into them Vaseline Sheer Vitamin Burst,sensitive skin
I like the FEEL of the lotion.  It goes on smoothly without being greasy ... which I like.  However the smell is VERY perfumey (almost overwhelming IMO) ...  hours later and it's all I can smell.  I like my lotions to have a nice scent but not that strong.  It smells like I sprayed my entire body and clothing with strong perfume ... and I only put a small amount on my hands.  You certainly wouldn't want to wear any other type of scents while using this lotion.  The MINERAL RENEWAL version feels the same but has more of a muted fruity smell that is not strong.  I like the MINERAL RENEWAL version MUCH better for that reason. Very STRONG fragrant SCENT ... but LOTION works.,Neutral
Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is ok if you think of it as your average lotion. But not if you are expecting top of the line moisturizer. It smells like those lotions that they give you with some perfumes sets whose purpose is to preserve the fragrance of the perfume in your body through the lotion. Well this lotion smells just like that. Frankly the smell is too strong and may even overpower your own perfume fragrance. So I have opted to only use this at night so it does not compete with my perfume. Of course you can use this lotion instead of perfume. Yes it is that aromatic.The lotion is very light I suppose it is heavily water based and it is absorbed by your body rather quickly. It is barely creamy and I feel that I have to constantly put more lotion to keep my body mostly my hands moisturized. My personal preference is a creamier lotion. But if you prefer more water based and less creamy lotions this is for you. As I mentioned it is absorbed from the body quickly and does not leave a oily residue.Overall it is an ok lotion and it absorbs into your skin quickly. But it's moisturizing effect is not strong enough to make a difference.Personally I preferAveenoLubriderm St Ives orJergens. They are creamier and have noticeable results and they are in a similar cost value range. Your average lotion not very creamy,Neutral
This lotion feels very nice going on and seems to be making short work of my very dry heels after just one application -- which normally lotions are ineffective in combating. This by itself suggested to me that this lotion is for seriously dry skin and I'm delighted to have it to battle winter dryness. It leaves a dry almost powdery feel behind it when applied. It is not at all greasy feeling.It has a strangely potent smell when first applied. It seems to fade rapidly but not completely. I cannot even describe what the smell is like but it is pleasant enough but probably overly strong for those who are sensitive to scents or prefer to use separate perfume.However I have had significant problems with the pump bottle it came in. When it arrived it appeared that the top had come open (as it did not look sealed down as in the Amazon product photo) and there was minor leaking inside the plastic bag mine was delivered in. A few pumps later it stopped pumping completely. I spent some time adjusting the the pump mechanism but I cannot identify the source of the problem. I was able to partially disassemble it so as to make it work; presumably I will have problems using this until I am able to transplant a functioning pump to this container. I would not normally include shipping considerations in a review except that if it is easily broken in transit it may not be the right item to order online. Nice lotion; bottle not sturdy enough for delivery by mail,dry skin
I was looking forward to testing this new lotion. I found the packaging and bottle quite appealing. The lotion went on smoothly but I had a problem with the scent. Its way to 'perfumey' and not in a good way. I put the lotion on the evening before when I went to bed and I noticed the smell on my arms the next day. This might be good if I liked the scent. But the scent is musky and smells like vitabath or maybe purell.  Some sort of cheap-ish perfumed shampoo. I much prefer a lighter scent or a scent that smells like fruit with my lotions. This might aggravate people's allergies.I might be interested if the perfume or scent could be changed or was more organic smelling. It's just that I found the scent too strong and unappealing to want to continue using. Cheap Perfume Smell,Neutral
This lotion has been very good for my dry hands.  I work a lot with my hands and they are always in danger of cracking.  This lotion is easy to apply absorbs quickly and protects for several hours.  Right after I put it on there is a film that eventually goes away.  I would prefer no film at all but it absorbs pretty quickly so it's not too big a deal.  The bigger drawback is the strong scent.  It a pleasant scent just wish it weren't so strong.  The majority of the scent does go away quickly leaving your hands moisturized and smelling nice.  I prefer Vasaline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy overall - it's a better moisturizer with a very light scent and no residue.  This product is good as well though. Very good lotion but has a very strong perfume smell,Neutral
Sheer Infusion with Stratys  Mineral Renewal body lotion.  The smell is soft and perfumey.  The lotion itself does make your skin feel like silk.  The lotion did not irritate my skin and I have extremely sensitive skin.  The lotion is not heavy but it isn't very light either middle of the line I suppose.  I did get the vitamin burst as well and it was about the same all the way around even down to the smell.  I don't know if over time I would be able to tell the difference but as of now I can not.I would definately use either this or the vitamin burst again. I would use it again,sensitive skin
My family uses a lot of lotion especially with winter coming. I am the kind of person who washes their hands at least a dozen times a day. Between dishes laundry bath cooking regular cleaning etc. it seems as though I am constantly washing & drying my hands. It has totally taken a toll on my skin and I have had a hard time finding a good lotion to help repair the damage...until now.I found the scent to be pleasant not strong and lingering. I could even use my own perfume after applying it. Furthermore almost immediately it penetrated my skin and left it not feeling greasy or sticky like many of the glycerin ones do. After trying Mineral Renewal for almost a week I decided it worked.This formula contains vitamins B and E for those whose skin needs a boost. Features Ferngully scent including blend of sparkling citrus and red currant berries pear and rhubarb and enlivening flowers and spices.You might not appreciate all the technology that goes into each bottle but you will see the difference on your skin. You will just see great results and this is a great product. The key thing to remember is that the lotion absorbs into all those layers of your skin so none are neglected. The lotion is easy to like. It's housed in attractive blue and white plastic bottles with a pump or flip top featuring a plastic insert to signify one of three types.Aside from that I've also noticed that I don't need to reapply every time I wash my hands which I absolutely love. I've been using this lotion for about a week now and my skin is so soft. The damage to my hands is almost completely gone. Great for dry skin sufferers value and budget conscious busy mom who's into trying new things!,great product
Vaseline's Sheer Infusion lotion is thick creamy and white and a little translucent.  A small amount covers a lot of skin.  It's not greasy at all but that doesn't mean your skin feels bare. After using it on my hands it takes ten minutes or so before I'm comfortable touching things.The lotion moisturizes well and it lasts.  Using it overnight my skin felt noticeably more soft in the morning.The Mineral Renewal has a fairly strong citrusy perfume added.  The scent faded pretty quickly but it was strong at first.  The scent wasn't offensive but I didn't like it much either. People who are sensitive to perfumes will want to avoid this one.I also tried the Botanical Blend which smells like flowers which I personally liked more.  Other than that I didn't notice any difference between the lines at least on initial use. Works well,Neutral
This lotion has a very very strong scent to it.  If you are sensitive to smells this product is NOT for you.  Even if you are not sensitive to perfumes the scent of this lotion will linger for hours on your skin.  The lotion did not feel like it lasted very long.  I much prefer my Curel lotion over this Vaseline product because my hands and skin feel much smoother and soft for a longer period of time with Curel compared to this lotion. Scent Is Way Too Strong,Neutral
I was pleasantly surprised when I applied Sheer Infusion by Vaseline.  First of all it is just the right consistency not too thick and not too thin.  It glides on legs and arms quite easily.  It seems that the Stratys  multi-layer ingredient does a good job of softening skin not just for a few minutes but  for hours.  I live in a relatively dry place so moisturizing is important.  However I'm not as happy about the Botanical Blend scent which seems too strong sometimes overpowering perfumes and colognes.  Perhaps a different scent or even better an unscented version would be better.The bottle is easy to handle and grip but it's not necessary to pick it up much since it has a good pump handle. It seem to allow  a medium amount of the product out so as not to get too much at one time. Compared to the more expensive body lotion products which claim to do miracles this new Vaseline product is a good value for the money. As for the bottle design there is nothing too special here in terms of color and shape.  It's basic and simple.  I'm not fond of blue the color of the bottle which it seems unnatural but perhaps that makes it stand out among other products.  To me the colors of nature are more appealing.I would buy this product again since the bottom line is that it works even if the scent is a bit too strong. Sheer infusion success -- somewhat,Neutral
I like the FEEL of the lotion.  It goes on smoothly without being greasy ... which I like.  My hands get EXTREMELY dry and cracked in the winter so I'm constantly having to apply and re-apply hand lotion.  This lotion instantly made my hands feel and look better (of course they are only mildly dry now).  The smell is more of a muted fruity melon scent that fades over time so not overwhelming.  If you are debating between this version and the VITAMIN BURST ... the smell of the VITAMIN BURST is significantly stronger and VERY perfumey (almost overwhelming IMO) ...  hours later and it was all I could smell.  I like my lotions to have a nice scent but not that strong. You certainly wouldn't want to wear any other type of scents while using the VITAMIN BURST lotion.  I like the MINERAL RENEWAL version MUCH better for that reason.  I still prefer the Aveeno Moisturizing CREAMS (regular and baby) to this lotion. Goes on SMOOTHLY feels NICE and SMELLS ok ...,Neutral
I usually do not like any kind of lotion it sits on the skin and makes me feel suffocated.  After about  minutes this lotion really did sink in well and didn't leave a film like every drugstore-available lotion I had tried in the past.  I even like the smell -- not too perfumed not medicinal.  It is also a great value for how it makes your skin feel.  I will buy this again to help keep the winter from drying me out. It really does sink in and create silky skin!,Neutral
So this lotion goes on well absorbs fast and leaves my dry winter skin well-moisturized thoughout the day.  But it's got a very perfume-y smell that was pretty strong at first.  It hasn't bothered me thoughout the day but on first application I'm not thrilled.  Still I've been using it regularly.  But I probably won't buy it again; I'm still looking for a lotion with no distinctive odor but that goes on well. emollient and not gready but. . .,Neutral
This is a very gentle yet effective cleanser. Perfect for my combination skin. The only complaint I have is the strong smell. It smells like a drug store shampoo. I'll finish using this bottle but probably won't buy again. Good cleanser but strong perfume smell,Neutral
My title says it all.  I am a big fan of sea buckthorne products.  I don't know how much of the sea buckthorny-goodness transfers through the soap.  But it leaves my face and hands feeling soft and clean.  It smells nice too...but not sticky sweet or perfumey. Makes my skin feel amazing,Neutral
I was looking for a soap without the kinds of chemicals found in almost all commercial American soaps at a reasonable price.  I'd never heard of Dudu Osun but the reviews were mostly raves so I ordered a dozen bars.  I haven't had any problems with the soap (some people have reported rashes extreme dryness etc.) I like the lather and the price is good.  I don't have skin problems I was hoping to solve so I can't vouch for any miraculous properties but wasn't hoping for any.  But I have to say the scent is overwhelming compared to any other soap I've used.  As soon as I took it out of the box it filled the room and a week later it still permeates the bathroom.  And the scent doesn't seem natural but some acrid irritating chemical although I really don't know what it is.  I'm a little sorry I ordered twelve bars.UPDATE:After using about eight of the dozen bars I purchased I don't find the scent as overwhelming as I originally did.  I don't know whether I've simply gotten used to it or whether the batch that that first bar came from just had a huge amount of perfume dumped into it.  Also I find the soap is each bar lasts me about twenty showers--three weeks once a day--which is longer than the softest soaps (like glycerin soaps) but shorter than the hard-milled soaps. Overpowering Scent,Neutral
This is a nice light product that is very effective!  It is gently scented so it does not interfere with perfume or cologne.  It is absorbed quickly and leaves skin smooth and supple-feeling.  I really like it.  Not sure about the anti-aging factor but I do recommend it's immediate impact. Smooth,Neutral
This is pleasant to use goes on easily spreads easily spf  helps protect your face from the suns harmful rays. I have not found any difference in the appearance of my facial skin no worse and no better. The scent is OK but I think it is a little on the perfumey side and would prefer something with either less scent or unscented. I have had no skin irritations or problems from this but if your face is overly sensitive to perfumes then maybe you had better get a sample of this to try first. pleasant to use,Neutral
I used Olay products for years and trusted the brand name for a long time. This product doesn't turn me off of Olay products - although I've tried to switch my health and beauty products to ones that have ingredients I can actually pronounce - but I really did not like the Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream.The cream is not so creamy. It's quite heavy and difficult to smooth on to my skin. Even when I use just the small amount dispensed by the pump it takes a while to rub it in and then if I am out in the sun sweating makes the stuff run down my face. Also there is a very strong perfume scent to the product (it makes me sneeze) and I found that not only did I have that same scent on my face it was nearly impossible to wash off my hands after using the cream so I end up smelling the stuff that makes me sneeze throughout the day.I had to stop using this product after a few attempts. It just doesn't work for my skin or lifestyle. Heavy cream with an unpleasant scent,long time
Like all of my Olay products when I receive them I can't wait to try them to start the transformation and the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Dna Superstructure Uv Cream Spf was no different!When it was delivered I couldn't help but notice how nicely these items are always packaged.  The are not easily destroyed in transit and look like a high end cream that you'd buy at any department store.DNA Superstructure UV Cream promises to help block direct DNA damaging rays to help protect your skin and maintain collagen's structural integrity. And I must say that after using this product for over a month my skin is well-hydrated even and supple.  It looks absolutely luminous in every-sense of the word!It keeps my face moisturized and firm. I love the way it looks when on and it feels light as a feather non-greasy and it has that beautiful light scent that some of the better known Olay products have.  *This scent is not over-powering and will not mix with any perfume or scent you'd like to wear*I've made this product a part of my daily routine.  I wear it under my foundation for maximum sun protection!  I highly recommend this product to everyone that likes a moisturizer that goes on smooth is quickly absorbed and doesn't mix with your foundation or perfume!If you liked the Olay Pro-X line you'll love this too! Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cream,Neutral
The lotion works well but its very perfumed and the pump quit while there was still a fair amount left in the bottle. Olay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf ,Neutral
I use many of the products in the Olay Regenerist line and like most of them. They are not overly perfumed oily or thick and seem to work well with my skin type. (That is to say the ever-so-boring normal skin type.)The products seem to be as effective as the more expensive lines I have tried but sadly don't work miracles. I think the rule of thumb for most anti-aging products is: moisturize but don't emphasize.This anti aging roller is a new offering in the Regenerist line which promises to reduce eye puffiness lines and wrinkles. It is basically a hard plastic tube with a plunger on one end and three small metal rollers on the other. You use the plunger to push the lotion up to the top and then spread it over the eye area with the rolling beads. If you have thin skin in this area (and most of us aging beauties do) the rolling beads will quickly give you the heebie jeebies. We have been taught to be extremely gentle when applying products to the under eye area and rolling cold hard metal balls over this delicate tissue seems inadvisable at best.  The product itself is thin and a bit slimy. It dries relatively quickly after application but leaves behind a shiny film. I think I could deal with all of this if the product miraculously filled in lines but it does not. It may make the lines marginally less noticable but my guess is that there is a microscopic difference. The cold rolling balls do seem to reduce puffiness but I would bet that cool cucumber slices might have a similar effect without the potential tissue trauma.So I will take a pass on this one. I will keep buying their day creamOlay Complete Oil-Free All Day Moisture Cream with UVA/UVB Protection -Ounce Jars (Pack of ) makeup removerOlay Regenerist Eye Make-Up Remover plus Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - . Ozand night serumOlay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment (. Ounces)but the shiny metal balls are not for me. Don't like the shiny metal balls,Neutral
I have used this for a little over a week with good results -  this is an innovative way to apply an eye cream.  The roller balls seem to have a cooling effect which feels GREAT.As with all the higher end Olay products (Pro X Regenerist) a LITTLE goes a long way. This product could easily last for months.  Just a little under the eyes can instantly reduce a puffy look.As others have mentioned I suspect the squalene and caffeine are the the most active components to this product. Similar products are used on film and television for years.I like the notion that the product is easy to throw into a gym bag or my everything bag the laptop carrier.  Perfect for a guy as there is no perfume and it works QUICKLY.I have also found it works like a charm on the  lines between the brows.  Particularly if you use it at night.Another note: I wear hydrogel contacts - which are sensitive to many things--no problems whatsoever with this product.It only missed a  star because it does not really instruct people to use less rather than more for excellent results.Use this with careand I think you will like itand be impressed. Rock and Roll--another one a guy can use!,long way
I have very long naturally curly hair and last week got the second worst haircut of my life. The only solution while waiting for the chunks (yes chunks) to grow out and blend with the ends was to flat iron it.The women at my local beauty supply suggested this Redken product.  Oh my God.  Instead of just lying flat as it does when I just wash condition dry and flat iron it my hair got fat ... and not in a good or funky way.Also the bottle does not spray evenly but drips and drizzles and the product no matter how little I use makes my hair sticky.  It's three o'clock in the morning and fifty-eight degrees in my house but I'm about to wash it because I just can't stand the stickiness and the smell. (I didn't mention that this stuff smells like a beauty salon so I smell like chemicals rather than my perfume.)I've always respected Redken.  Not anymore.  I'm just going to wash condition use Infusium  leave-in and then when I'm done if I need something for the ends I'll use either Silk or Soy Renewal.  I'm returning the Redken this morning as soon as the shop opens. The Worst Product Redken Ever Made,Neutral
There are many reasons I like this body wash.  First of all the pump is a stroke of genius.  Being able to leave the bottle in place and squirt the product onto a washcloth or puff is so much handier than trying to juggle a slippery wet bottle.  It also makes it possible to measure the amount you use very easily enabling you to get exactly the amount of lather you like without guessing.  I also found it lathered well; I used four squirts initially and quickly realized that two would have been plenty (note that I do have soft water).I usually don't like fruit fragrances (except in fruits) but this body wash is an exception.  The fragrance is light and appealing and it dissipates quickly after the shower so I don't go around smelling like rotting fruit which is how most fruit fragrances strike me.  It also makes it a nice choice for an all-family body wash since no one will have to waft unwanted perfume all day.I also like that some consideration was given to the ingredients used to create this body wash.  After all your skin is the largest organ of your body and it's hard to think it's a good idea to regularly expose it to petrochemicals and artificial colors and scents.Most important for me is how my skin reacts to the product.  My skin is a little sensitive and easily irritated by some products and it is dry especially in the winter months.  I had no problems with the body wash and happily I find I'm able to cut back on applying post-shower moisturizer using it only every two or three showers without getting the ashy skin and dry-skin itching that often plague me.  The bottle also claims that it brightens skin but I can't say I notice any difference.  My skin certainly isn't duller but it looks pretty much the same as ever to me.  Presumably this claim is based on papaya being an exfoliant but I doubt it is concentrated enough or remains on the skin long enough to have much exfoliant effect.I anticipate this nice big bottle lasting quite awhile especially since I'm able to use just the right amount each time but when it does run out I will look for this brand again. Nice shower luxury,Neutral
This papaya body wash is supposed to smell like papaya but to me it smells more like dime store perfume.  The initial smell although it dissipates after a shower is a total turn off for my husband and he refuses to even try the body wash.  A lower key less perfume-y smell would mean only  body wash container in our shower.The body wash claims to brighten dull skin and to be a moisturizer because its ingredients help lock moisture in the skin.  I have dry skin and after about two weeks use I cannot tell that my skin is brighter but I can say that there are some moisturizing qualities in the body wash (but not enough for me to discontinue use of an additional moisturizer post shower).I have gotten use to the body wash's initial smell but I do not think I will purchase it for regular family use because I would need to keep  body wash containers in my shower.  If the Papaya Body Wash were a more neutral smell I'd reconsider my decision.   Stars because of the heavy perfume smell.***  A nice thing about this company is that a portion of their product sales go to a good cause so if this is something that you look for when purchasing products take a look at the company's website for more detailed information. *** Strong Sweet Perfume Smell Right out of Container Later Dissipates Somewhat.  Ok Moisturizing. Nice Pump Design,Neutral
I liked this body wash.  It has a nice soft tropical/slightly fruity/slightly coconut scent that does not linger after use.  It seems live up to its claim of moisturizing since it left my skin soft and not dry or itchy.  I have sensitive skin and also am allergic to some perfumes and strong scents and I did not have any problems with using this body wash.  As others have said it does not produce much lather or suds but that was not a problem for me.  The bottle is large and it should last for a long time so although it seems a bit expensive it is a good value. Moisturizing body wash with nice scent,long time
This body wash bath/shower gel has a very minimal citrus scent which I prefer over strong perfumes.It is a clear gel forms an average lather and is pleasant enough to use.What I'm not really crazy about is I'm left with a slick slimy film and feel of the skin. I noticed the same feeling in other moisturizing bath products and I tend not to buy this type although I have dry skin.I just leave the shower feeling that I am not so much fresher as I am layered in slick film which seems impossible to remove unless I go over it with a regular soap.In my own opinion  I don't care for this feeling at all. Others may like it though. Slick Moisture,Neutral
My wife Yumi likesNature's Gate Papaya Velvet Moisture Body Washbetter than her previous body washDove Deep Moisture. She received a free bottle of Nature's Gate via the Amazon Vine program. I interviewed Yumi after a couple uses.What was your first impression?The smell was natural. It smelled like fresh papaya and not like some chemically perfume.So does Dove smell like perfume?Yes Dove has a stronger fragrance that stays on my skin. Nature's Gate didn't leave a papaya smell on my skin after my shower.Did the body wash provide a good lather?It lathered really well but I used my towel.Right theSalux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel. You recommended that last year on Amazon.It is a great towel exfoliating but much softer than loofah.What else did you like about Nature's Gate body wash?I noticed my skin was brighter and very smooth after each use.So Nature's Gate is a better moisturizer than Dove?Not really after using the papaya wash I had to put lotion on my legs and arms. My skin is very dry. With Dove I don't need to put on lotion after my shower.I'm confused. Which body wash do you like better Dove or Nature's Gate?I like the papaya body wash better. Nature's Gate is soukaina (refreshing exhilarating). Can you look up the word? It is hard to translate. You might try `sappari' (refreshed neat) too.Summary: Nature's Gate Papaya Velvet Moisture Body Wash is refreshing with a natural scent but you might still need some lotion after your shower if you have very dry skin.Rating: Five stars. Soukaina & Sappari: Better than Dove Deep Moisture,Neutral
Well I have to admit that I'm not a Nature's Gate product user and have bought many products from Olay. I'm a type of person who likes to try new things so my curiosity got the best of me plus I heard some good things about this brand.After using this for a couple of days I found that it doesn't lather well which is okay I guess but I like a lot of foam. The best thing about this product is the convenient and non-messy pump bottle. To me two pumps is enough to clean your whole body. The formula is a clear lotion that cleans well but leaves skin feeling fresh and moisturized.The papaya scent is a subtle tropical fragrance that is refreshing but not too sweet. Actually it smells a bit more like mango than papaya but it's still a nice scent. The fragrance however does not last on the skin too long either which is good if you use a scented body lotion or perfume and don't want it to interfere. The bonus is that the formula is paraben-free...good for you and good for the environment. Aside from that I won't be returning to this anytime soon but rather stick to what works for me....and until the next best thing comes on the shelf. I would like to continue this product but I'm more of an Olay Product fan.........,Neutral
I'm ever on the lookout for good natural cosmetics. This body wash definitely fits the bill. Up until now I'd been using the Jason natural body wash and I find this product to be on par with that one. Both are moisturizing and have a nice light scent and use natural ingredients. I find I like the pump on this product better however I think that the Jason suds a bit more. Not that sudsing is a gauge for how well a soap works it's just an observation for those who prefer their body wash to be bubbly.I'm one of those people that can't stand getting out of the shower and smelling like a bottle of perfume. I like products that have a nice clean light scent - preferably something natural. This definitely delivers in that regard.I can't really speak to the claims that it brightens dull skin. I honestly hadn't noticed that (and don't feel like my skin is particularly dull in any regard). Either way this is a nice body wash that I would definitely recommend. Moisturizing with a light scent,Neutral
I have been using Dr. Denese suncreen tinted face lotion for about  years but I decided after watching Dr. Oz to try this stuff- big mistake first this stuff arrived from Korea which drew a red flag for me and this stuff was heavily perfumed. I figured that since I already bought it that I would try a little bit and it looked like I painted white foundation on my face it was thin when I applied it but on my face it looked caked no matter how little I used. I had to wash it off before leaving the house. I will never doubt Dr. Denese's sunscreen tinted face lotion again. AWEFUL,little bit
This is the first BB cream brand that I ever tried and its the one I keep going back to.  I've tried various Korean brands but this has been the most consistent performer.  IN general you can't go wrong with the Asian BB cream brands.  Don't be worried about not being able to read the packaging; it is the product itself that matters.My skin tone is NC-.  In terms of this product I fall somewhere in between  milky beige and  light beige;  natural beige is way too dark for me.  This also has SPF  which means i don't need to use a separate sunscreen- yay!  The color is a bit grayish but it blends into my skin without making it ashy.One single pump is enough coverage for my entire face.  If I use more then my skin will become greasy.  I apply using a damp sponge which yields a nice natural look.  The finish is matte and for the most part it keeps skin pretty matte up to  hours.  I do apply powder during the day but only because I can't stand any shine.Coverage is excellent.  Less is definitely more.  This covers redness around my nose and the rare pimple.  It does not entirely cover dark circles but it does lighten the undereye area.One star off because this does have a perfumey smell.  I use it sparingly so it doesn't bother me as much but some days it keeps bothering my eyes (I am highly sensitive to perfumes).I alternate between this and the Choboyang bb cream depending on the occasion.  I prefer this because of the matte coverage.  Again do not use too much or your skin will become oily!I highly recommend giving this a try.  You can buy this and other Asian BB creams from an Asian market directly from the product's website or from amazon (though I'd read the product description to be sure the tube is the correct size).  The full size tube will last you a year at least so its may be worth the cost. This BB cream is perfect indeed!,Neutral
I love this deodorant.  I bought the vanilla lavender and it smells great.  I have also purchased the body wash and shave  in  and love it.  I got the body wash in passion fruit and used it all up so I immediately bought more in grapefruit.  I have bad perfume allergies but this stuff doesn't bother me. Yay! smells great,Neutral
The genuine Japanese Salux wash cloths are amazing. I don't know personally about the Chinese/other knock-offs but the reviews for those are bad. So really if you get one that rocks your world and lasts and lasts (I'm still using the one from  with not a sign of wear/tear) and makes so much lather you extend the life of your bottle of pricey hypoallergenic or costly perfumed shower gel than you got the real thing.These are long and they are rough-textured. I have sensitive skin prone to eczema and I was afraid to use it. But I find if I don't use overly hot water and don't scrub too long I'm fine. I do what a lot of sensitive skin folks do--I cream up forehead to toes as soon as I get out of the shower while skin is moist. With these towels I know I got the dead skin and dirt off and I can cream up with confidence.The trick with the towel is to wet it thoroughly BEFORE you squeeze on a dollop of your shower gel or rub your bar of soap on it --works best with liquid soap or gel just so you know. Then squish and mush it up in your hands. It will lather up like mad. Even gels that didn't lather up much in regular cloth towels for me they later up a lot with the Salux. Which is GREAT.Okay so then you keep the towel out of the strong water stream or the lather will rinse right off. That's one of the key things about the Salux. It rinses thoroughly FAST. No residue. So it stays fresh-smelling clean and keeps working just right.The only reason I'm ordering more is that I gave my back-up one to hubby to scrub his back--the Salux is long enough that you can open it up hold end to end and scrub your back. So I want two to have a back-up for him and for me. Or even to add to gift baskets. Cause really these things don't seem to wear out. Like I said  / years and counting..still going strong.If you hate rough-textured stuff skip this. If you love how soft your skin feels and how unclogged your pores are after exfoliating this is a wonderful invention of a wash cloth. Try it. It's pretty cheap for its usefulness and durability. (Great for scrubbing rough elbows and soles of feet too after pumicing to help fully smooth out.) I keep one of those old-fashioned laundry clips I inherited from MIL (top is like the hangar hood and bottom is like those bag clips) and I keep mine hanging to dry in the shower off the towel rack that's in there. Dries fine.In case you're confused about the numbers--  and such--my understanding from the official Salux site is that the number is for the color/packaging (how many and what colors) but that they are all the same size.Note: Read the reviews and see which companies are sending knock-offs to rip you off while claiming it's a real Salux. The picture here is of a real Salux --the color medallion saying it got an award woman in the photo using it to scrub her back. It should say made in Japan . It should work exactly as I've described and how fans of it describe. Be a careful shopper. Complain to Amazon if you're not sent the right item. Give the seller a negative review if they rip you off.Enjoy.  Stars for REAL PRODUCt from Japan be careful what you get!,sensitive skin
It smells a little herbal perfumey when first applied but the smell fades after a few minutes. It also feels a little tacky while it's drying but once it's dry it leaves skin smooth and silky and very well conditioned. It's a great substitute for body lotion after a shower during the summer months. Great skin conditioner,Neutral
I just started using this product so I can't tell if there are any benefits. I do want to tell you how strong the fragrance is. At first it was overwhelming and a bit concerning because products with perfumes and dies are not good for your face. But I bought it so I'm going to use the bottle and see if I notice any change.  You do get used to the smell after a few uses and it wears off throughout the day. Lets be clear-its not a nasty smell its clearly fragrance they added.Its also a bit oily the instructions says use generously but unless you want your face to feel like you ate a bucket of fried chicken  pump ( MAX) should be enough. Rub in well and its not that bad. Kind of gives a nice dewy glow. Strong Frangrance,Neutral
This cream is great. It is very healthy to use-meaning unlike an extremely high percentage of other creams/moisturizers this product has a very low toxic rate (if any). I've personally reviewed all the ingrediants in this product and I will say I'm VERY impressed. It isn't % but it is thee closest I've seen so far on the market.Now even if you do find a moisturizing cream that is at a low toxic rate many of those creams do NOT moisturize or do what they are suppossed to. This cream does exactly what it claims-it moisturizes perfectly and there are NO perfume smells. Wonderful product! Healthy moisturizing product!,Neutral
My three rating is because the smell does not last on him now to also say I use a lot of different perfumes and all react different on all people so not saying it is bad just not for me sorry u will have to try it for yourself and see what u think Angle men spray,Neutral
They were selling this for over thirty dollar and I could not believe the selling price since after reading the ingredients with no ZO in the mix I checked to see the reviews on Amazon which were more misleading. They sell less chemicals in oz for much less money much much less money.Active Ingredients: Avobenzone (% Sunscreen) Homosalate (% Sunscreen) Octisalate (% Sunscreen) Octocrylene (% Sunscreen) Oxybenzone (% Sunscreen)Inactive Ingredients: Water Styrene Acrylates Copolymer Silica Butyloctyl Salicylate Cyclopentasiloxane Glycerin Alcohol Denatured Poly C  Alkyl Acrylate Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate Polymethylsilsesquioxane Caprylyl Methicone Trisiloxane Acrylates/Dimethicone Copolymer PEG  Stearate Glyceryl Stearate Phenoxyethanol Potassium Cetyl Phosphate Dimethicone Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E) Caprylyl Glycol Methylparaben Acrylates (C  Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer) Chlorphenesin Inulin Lauryl Carbamate Triethanolamine Ethylparaben Xanthan Gum Ethylhexl Glycerin Disodium EDTA Cassia Alata (Candle Tree) Leaf Extract Maltodextrin.These are pure chemicals that dry out the skin from alcohol to Methylparaben Triethanolamine to active ingredients of Oxybenzone which are top contenders on the list of EWG's overall hazard list. I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. ZO is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of % plus certified organic ingredients and FREE OF; fragrances perfumes additives softeners thickening agents gums alcohol biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone Oxybenzone UV Chemical absorbers paraben phthalates PABA and  dioxane. BABO has % ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with .% ZO. But ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. For a small investment sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn pain cancer medical bills pain killers etc. that come with skin exposure to the sun. No ZO Pure PABA + Oxybenzone...,dry skin
Great price.  Really good conditioner.  I recently tried Argan oil conditioner and the Argan is just a bit better but Matrix bodifying conditioner is one of the best I have ever used.  Also not perfume-y for the allergy prone.  NO LAVENDER in the scent.  I am very pleased.Oh and amazon has the best price I have compared both online in the beauty supply stores and the warehouse stores.  Only time the price can be beat or matched to amazon's price is if you have a coupon for one of the stores formerly mentioned.update as of //: price is the same as the warehouse stores now.  :( Good conditioner,argan oil
I have thick naturally curly/wavy hair that is color treated. I also have A LOT of hair. I have used many hair products before for curly hair and I have never had one yet that's made the curl come OUT of my hair! until I used this stuff. What the heck?! I had hopes for this cream after reading all the positive and happy reviews but sadly this stuff did nothing for me. It actually left my hair flat kinky instead of curly and other places straight? I also used a very minimal amount because I was avoiding the greasy hair look. The smell is also overwhelming. It smells like cheap perfume. I am so disappointed because this stuff is expensive! now I have to package it back up and send it back. Don't let all the reviews fool you your hair will NOT look like the advertisements on the MoroccanOil website. You will not be left with bouncy hydrated shiny curls. You will be left with limp frizz! One reviewer described her hair looking like a 'bad s perm' after using this. Exactly! my hair ended up looking like I crimped it! not the look I was trying to achieve. If you want a great hair product for curly hair try DevaCurl for curly hair. Now that stuff really works! I have no clue why I ever strayed but I will only use DevaCurl from now on. Works...If you want the s crimped hair look!,Neutral
Its a strong perfume and smell is good. It last for hours and I like it. Its worth for the money. Its a strong perfume,Neutral
I had high hopes this would really work for me.  I've had kp on the backs of my legs (thighs) since my early 's.  Not really sure where it came from although I suspect an allergy to friction/irritation from clothing dyes and sweating in pantyhose (which I no longer wear).  But I've had sensitive skin all my life.Anyway I used the product (easy to use) no overwhelming perfume scent etc. as the directions instructed.  The kp did not get better with time.  I gave it  stars since it did seem to lessen the kp's redness.  I wish the results were positive for me but I cannot recommend this product. This didn't work for me,sensitive skin
I am not a fan of this. I was hoping to like it as setting spray is an important step of my daily routine. The price point on this one is fantastic but it smells like I am spraying strong perfume on my face. I have a decently sensitive nose and I just cannot handle it. It also makes my makeup wear blotchy throughout the day. Will not be using or repurchasing. Smells Like Perfume,Neutral
The smell was far to over bearing for me to get past.  It has a real strong perfume smell and after a couple uses I ended up tossing it because I knew I wouldn't use it again. Smells strong.,Neutral
I use Burt's Bees night cream so I decided to give the day lotion a try. It has a very overpowering &#;old lady&#; smell. Too strong for the face. After a week or so I stopped using it. It was stronger than my perfume! I went back to my old favorite: Trader Joe's Nourish. Half the price and fragrance free. I love Burt's Bees but I won't be buying this lotion again. Overpowering Smell,Neutral
I purchased this during a recent binge on Burt Bees products. This little jar was cutely packaged and promised natural radiance that included royal jelly. The lotion is white and pearly.The lotion smells exactly like Ralph Lauren's Ralph (the original). Fortunately this is one of my favorite perfumes but I also know there is a large segment of people who when buying natural products don't want to feel like they just been hosed w/perfume.It is lightweight and would work well under makeup but even better as a nightcream because it left my skin extremely oily.I would only recommend using this cream only if you have dry or flaky skin. If you have sensitive skin -try at your own risk. Even w/my combination skin it made me have mild breakout.I tend to go for more of a clean smell like Neutrogena original face wash and after applying this on I felt the need to wash my face. It is disappointing b/c the rest of Burt Bees products are pretty good. Smells of Strong perfume lightweight Not for Oily skin,sensitive skin
I'm very sensitive to highly perfumed things. (I almost never wear perfume and have to keep dryer sheets in a plastic bag so they're closed off). So the smell of the cream is a little too strong for me. But I like the coolness on the skin around my eyes.Not sure if I notice a big difference in terms of &#;radiance&#; around my eyes but I haven't tossed it yet. ;) smells a little overpowering but feels nice.,Neutral
I love Burt's Bees sensitive skin daily moisturizer but wanted something with a little spf so bought the radience line - daily night and eye cream.I found this product went on tacky and greasy and stayed that way. It never soaked into my skin. I even waited  minutes before applying makeup. I used a really good eye shadow primer and withing  minutes my eye shadow was creased and smeared and worn off my eye lids. My face remained tacky to the touch all day. I was so relieved to wash it off. To top it off there is a strange sour smell to the scent of this product that I don't care for.I also bought the eye cream and the night moisturizer. The night cream is smoother less greasy and doesn't feel tacky at all. It also smells great without the sour smell. It absorbs well making my skin soft subtle lightly scented and smooth. I love the night cream.The eye cream is even tackier than the daily moisturizer and just slides around on my skin like gel or something. The eye cream smells even more sour bad enough I noticed it all day even though I wore perfume. So far the sensitive skin moisturizer does better for making my fine lines less visible. It made wearing eyeshadow impossible even with eye primer even without the greasy daily moisturizer. Its like putting slime around my eyes slime that bever dries. I tried three times using less and less each time with little difference. Would not recommend.I am mid s with oily skin. Pretty gross,sensitive skin
For those of you with sensitive noses - BE WARE! I have no idea why they thought that this product needed such a strong smell it's not even a good smell. It overpowers even my therapy grade chamomile oil (which smells so strongly I can't use it in the morning). I have recently converted to using products I have made myself for my skin regimen because the all-natural way of doing things has really helped my skin but this also means that everything I use contains no perfumes other than the smells coming from essential oils. To me the smell coming from this product is so strong that it's unacceptable. Just opening the container in a small room is too much much less using it on my face and smelling it for the remainder of the day. I may use this before bed but I will not be using it in the morning - it smells like the cloying scent of an older woman who wears too much powdery floral perfume and leaves a cloud of smell in their wake.I will say that the product FEELS nice despite the smell.Whether the product works or not I have no idea I haven't been wearing it for more than  miserable hour. The horrible Smell!,Neutral
I would give it a five star if it wasn't for the loud sweet honey / flower type smell. It feels great on the skin. It is between a lotion and ointment texture but not too oily. It is very soft. I wouldn't want to wear it to work due to the strong scent and my husband does not find cuddling pleasant with the sweet odor but I put it on just before closing my eyesy for the night and my skin is nice and soft by morning and the odor is almost completely gone. The smell does not set off my sinuses (I react to most perfumes). I do wish they would make it unscented. It is one of my favorite Burt's Bees products and my favorite moisturizer over all (great for legs arms hands...). Love the stuff!,Neutral
THIS PRODUCT HAD REALLY GOOD REVIEWS THAT I SAW. BECAUSE I LOVE THE ROOT BOOST SO MUCH(IT IS LIKE PERFUME FOR YOUR HAIR PLUS WORKS WELL) I DECIDED TO GIVE THE SPRAY A TRY. HOLD IS SOFTWHICH IS OKAY FOR ME. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME DELICIOUS SMELL THOUGH. NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED,Neutral
I love this stuff. I hate to be without it. Rose has strong aromatherapy benefits at uplifting ones moods. Plus conventional toners always dried my skin and have tons of chemicals. Also the smell of Febreeze makes me ill so I use this stuff to refresh the sofa and bed linens. I wish I could buy it buy the liter or gallon! Great Toner Light Perfume &  Linen Refresher,Neutral
I wear this every day and love it! It's very refreshing. I use it instead of perfume as it smells so good!  My husband often comments how good it smells too! With using it every day for a few months now it's only gone down around half and inch!  Really nice product! Delicious smelling feminine and fruity.,Neutral
I only gave this refillable spray bottle  stars because when you spray it leaks so you are wasting perfume. Travalo Black Refillable Mini Perfume Bottle Spray,Neutral
Its a good product but im upset that i broke it the perfume bottle i originally bought this for was unfortunately not a cap but one of those fancy types with little hose and the balloon pump and i couldn't take the cap off so i tried to open it to pour it in and therefor breaking the cap:/ So yea but im sure if i hadnt done that and used it on a regular snap off cap it wouldve worked perfectly Good product,Neutral
I gave this product as a gift to my mother and she loved it! She had no idea there were such things as mini perfume bottles that you could fill with your own perfume and since she often asks for small roller balls as gifts she loved that she could just choose any one of her favorite perfumes and have it with her anywhere! This was a big hit with her! ... product as a gift to my mother and she loved it! She had no idea there were such ...,Neutral
I have mixed feelings about this product.  I LOVE the size it is the perfect size to travel around with and you can put it in your purse travel bag or make up bag.  However when I go to put my perfume in the bottle it leaks and doesn't all go into the travalo... :( I wish this wasn't the case because I really like the idea and size of this product... but I don't want to waste my expensive perfume by having half of it leak out while filling it up.  The perfume DOES stay in the bottle once I am done filling it up but it is still an issue. Semi-Good Product,Neutral
I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I received the Travalo but it's really super easy to use.  You simply remove the little nozzle from your perfume bottle and position the Travalo over the nozzle so that the hole on the bottom lines up with the nozzle stem. You gently pump the Travalo up and down which transfers the perfume from the bottle to the Travalo. That's all there is to it.  When you want to use the Traval just take the top off and spray like you would a perfume bottle. This really is an ingenious idea. I'll be traveling this summer and the Travalo will definitely be in my suitcase especially considering that it's approved by the TSA! A definite must for traveling with perfume!,Neutral
I love these!  I may have to buy a few more.  I have a suuuuuuper large bottle of Chanel Eau Premiere and cannot travel with it (it's like  ounces seriously) but with this I can take just enough with me everywhere I go.  It is ridiculously easy to fill just pop the top of the sprayer off your bottle and press it against the bottom of the Travalo.  It never spills and the perfume does not evaporate.  Looks pretty too.  A new fave. these are just too awesome,Neutral
I love my Travalo's I actually have  of these in different colors in   Reds Silver Gold and Black (that I purchased from another site). This is the cheapest price but they only have it in Pink. Very easy to put your favorite perfumes without the mess that other atomizers have. Very cute and travel friendly size. Love love love it! Love it!,Neutral
I love my travalo i bring it in my purse and will put it in my clutch if i go out dancing. My perfume easily pumps into it but does get a little perfume coming out if the nozzle is too big for the travalo pump. The only issue is you have to spray out the entire thing if you want to put a different perfume in it or else they will mix. love it,Neutral
Hold perfume but you need to make sure that it stays upright in your purse as it can leak and then your purse smells real good Works,Neutral
I've never even considered having an atomizer because I feared that I would make a mess loose the funnel or waste my precious perfume filling the dern things. This is just what the psychologist would prescribe (if I had an actual fear of atomizers).To fill it you pop the spray cap/nozzle off your full sized perfume then place the bottom of the atomizer on top of the straw that the cap/nozzle came off of then pump. Took less than  minutes to open the box get my perfume and fill my atomizer &lt;!!!For those needing visual instructions on how to use this I actually bought this because I caught this youtube [...]She explains the product at about :. The actual site [...] also has their own videos but the link above is what made me want to buy this.So far I've had it over a month and I love it. I would like to point out that I did order the PINK travalo but the sprayer is BLACK not white as pictured. I prefer black myself but some people like to get exactly what they see.Hope you like it as much as I do!! Always in my purse,Neutral
I'd seen this at a large organizing store and finally purchased on Amazon. Amazing!!  This fills so neatly and travels perfectly without any leakage or evaporation. Really pleased with this purchase for my travel bag. Amazing for travel perfume,Neutral
This is nice looking and as they say doesn't leak.  I also like the fact that it sprays less at a time than the original bottle so I use it at home as well as traveling.The first paragraph was my original review.  I still like all of that but now that I have to refill it it just isn't happening.  I don't know why because I'm refilling from the same bottle.  If anyone has any help for this I'd love to hear.  I don't want to buy another when I don't know why this one isn't taking the perfume.  It really is a  star product but can't rate it that if I can't use it any more. Not sure what I'm missing.,Neutral
I was so excited to try this because of all the hype it got. I filled it up and kept it in my car. A couple days later I went to use it and there was nothing it it! (I hadn't even used it yet). I figured it evaporated or something due to the heat in my car. So I filled it up again and put it in my purse. Once again after a couple days I was to spray some. Nothing was in it! Keeps leaking and I don't get any use out of it. What a waste of perfume! :( Even though it is a great idea I would not recommend this product. Leaked :/,Neutral
Great for carrying in your purse. Gives you an opportunity to use the perfume out of that big bottle that's sitting at home.Occasionally this product will have some trouble with stubborn perfume bottle nozzle. Works very well,Neutral
Useful for travel and to throw into your makeup bag for perfume applications during the day. It doesn't leak like other travel perfume bottles I've tried and the mist that sprays out is perfect. Good,Neutral
I have  big bottles of perfume and they are to big for my purse so I bought this  Travalo  pink refillable spray mini perfume bottle  I might buy more but in a different color. It makes it  easer to carry in my purse. Travalo Pink Refillable Spray Mini Perfume Bottle.-Ounce,Neutral
I travel pretty frequently for work and hated buying small colognes because they are pricey and not offered in all scents so I bought this little guy.Pros:) Easy to fill up. Simply take the nozzle of your perfume/cologne and put this on top then pump it up.) Looks good and is small) Quality - No leaks so far and I've had it filled up for many months now) Price - it is cheap and has saved me the purchase price from buying tiny bottlesI haven't had any cons yet but since it is made out of plastic I'm sure if you keep it in your purse and let it bang around it would probably break and leak over time No leakage for me,Neutral
Easy inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for. The filling action was easy and did not require any pouring like others do--simply insert regular size perfume without lid into the bottom and press like normal to fill. Did not experience issues with leaking as others have mentioned. Exactly what I was looking for,Neutral
I was really excited to try this so that I can stop having to carry around a ridiculously large bottle of perfume to reapply throughout the day but I was very disappointed with this product. I'm not sure if I got a defective one but this did not work on any of my perfumes. I thought maybe the nozzle was too short so I tried it on several different ones and nothing happened. Defective?,Neutral
This product was so much smaller then i expected it to be and doesn't work for all perfumes plus i guarantee it will leak during the time you have it. Its just better to buy a small empty spray bottle and fill it with your favorite perfume. Not really worth it...,favorite perfume
I used the PVC type for years as well as tennis balls. I still use PVC ones for fine clothing but Nellie's is great for jeans and Polos since makes those wear quicker due to the abuse by Nellie's. Nellie's will do make your clothes look older since it will rub the heck out of the load that you put in since it really moves around in the dryer. No perfume no fabric softener no harsh cleaning agents for me... I like Nellie's brand it is PVC free but I have to admit it is loud and not for delicate loads at all. Bravo. PVC Free...,Neutral
These days perfume is so expensive so i buy scented lotions from bath and body works instead.And this one is my favorite. It smells so so so good! I do love that lotion moisturizes too. This one makes your skin super soft.I love it! I will buy more soon. This scent is there most popular for obvious reasons(A) it smells Fantastic  (B) Same as reason A and (C) Same as reasons A and B.Here is a tip for buying it: Have a receipt from bath and body works and do the phone survey and get the code for $ off your $ purchase and then go to Bath And Body Works and use the buy  bottles get  free deal.Each bottle is . so for  bottles it is . and $. off is .. So you pay . for  big bottles of lotion. Enjoy! Best lotion from bath and body works!,Neutral
Worked like it was supposed to. Smelled to high heaven of an intolerable perfume. I couldn't stand to be around my own face. However i don't hate it because it got me on track for looking for retin a which cured my cystic acne in five short weeks. Now i use the dermaroller and DHC's vit C and aura cacia's lavender oil to cure the scars. a stepping stone to fast relief,Neutral
I bought this for dry beat-up looking cuticles.  I've been using it at least once a day for a couple weeks and am very pleased with it so far.  My cuticles and nails look nicer.  The cream smells very good fresh and clean and not perfumed or artificial.  The tin it comes in is cute and a nice size I expect it to last a long time since you can't tell I've even used it yet.  Overall very pleased! very nice stuff,long time
Great value for the money.  It has a nice fresh scent.  The reason I gave it  starts instead of  is that I was almost unsure if this was authentic because of the staying power.  Seems like the bottle that I purchased in the mall lasted longer when I sprayed it on than this bottle.  Could be a bad batch or my chemistry?  Who knows. Still a good deal for designer brand perfume. It lives up to its name for sure,Neutral
While it's named Pretty and more than lives up to it's name; it could easily be known as Charming.  It's a floral bouquet on an oiled walnut table that sits before an open window in a very clean house in the country - during the Spring with the scent of woods rustling the curtain.  If you can picture that and then imagine a freshly showered woman standing by the window that will describe the scent and soul of Pretty perfume.Love it.  The woods and florals come out very strong then it's all showered and scented woman.It's often criticized for being unoriginal.  Perhaps it is when compared to other perfumes that are designed to stop rooms.  This was is not it's as if it is intentionally demure.  Natural.  Clean woody floral.  When taken for what is is it is very very charming.For that I humbly give it a four rating.  Those who are looking for   smoking and complicated sexy aren't going to find it here.  It's a natural beauty and I love it for that. It's Charming Perfume,Neutral
I am an avid tanner and have tried tons of lotions and this is the first I have truly loved.  It is thin and not oily so it is easy to apply.  After tanning it does not rub off on your clothes and leave you feeling greasy for the rest of the day.  The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering.  As a matter of fact I have had a few people tell me that they love the perfume I am wearing.  I also find it to be very moisturizing.  It leaves my skin feeling soft even after I shower.  The price on amazon is way lower than at the tanning bars and a bottle will last a LONG time. Fresh scent!,long time
So it doesn't smell exactly like Chance but that's what it reminds me of.  Yes it is a strong smell but it's got a hint of citrus base to the smell just a hint so it's bearable.  The silicone in the lotion really helps it spread smoothly.  There is not a greasy feel or stickiness and the results after the tanning bed are immediately noticeable.  I haven't tanned all winter so I went for  minutes.  Yes I can see a difference and I would not have seen one if I hadn't use this accelerant. Not after just  minutes!  And as other reviewers have stated you can go straight from the tanning bed to work/school/restaurant and not be self-conscience about the odor...it doesn't smell like you just left the tanning bed. This is big and smells like Chanel Chance Perfume,Neutral
I've used a lot of different tanning lotions over the years and Phoenician is by far my favorite lotion that doesn't contain bronzers. I alternate my tanning sessions between bronzers and non-bronzers (DS Bellezza is my favorite bronzer). For those who haven't tried Designer Skin's silicone lotions the texture is phenomenal. I don't believe there's any spa treatment that could make your skin feel so soft and smooth. It soaks into your skin right away no wasting time rubbing it in. There is no greasy feeling and it dries almost powdery. It has a very soft scent. Don't be put off by the fig fragrance. A lot of fig-scented lotions and perfumes as well as real figs themselves can be quite strong. This has a subtle fresh fig fragrance that doesn't linger or leave you with that dreaded after tan smell. I kind of wish the smell would last longer because it's so nice. I would recommend this to both beginner and experienced tanners. Everyone should try this!,Neutral
This lotion is very thick which is good because it moisturizes like crazy. However and I'm not really sensitive to smell it smells horrible. It smells like vasiline and old perfume. I spent the money so I'm going to try to just deal with it. I would not purchase again only because of the strong unpleasant odor. Its good but it stinks,Neutral
I love this brand of BB creams because the shade is perfect on my skin and it feels as though you are not wearing makeup. I have very light porcelain skin and was scared this would not match my skin but it does. I also have oily/combination skin and it controls my oil better than regular foundation does. So i am gonna review each products for you.() Super BB Triple Function (Hot Pink) - Is one of the most popular Skin BB creams. It has good coverage and covers up minor blemishes well. It smells sort of like sunscreen though which isn't bad (smells better than most foundations out there xD) but not the best smelling BB cream.() BB Diamond Collection (Light Pink) - My personal favorite out of the bunch. It has minor coverage but feels the lightest on my skin. It smells REALLY good like a light floral perfume and not overbearing. The oil control isn't great but if you put oil control powder over it it works really well. It also has a light shimmer to it as well but not crazy noticeable.() Super Beblesh Balm (Gold) - Is for more mature skin. Since i am a young adult () i don't use this one (in fact i gave it to my mom). It has good coverage (better than the hot pink one) and covers up minor wrinkles. It has a very faint floral smell to it as well.() BB Diamond Pearl (Silver) - Is the one i like the least out of the bunch. In fact its not really a makeup to me. It is very shimmery but it smells great just like the BB Diamond cream. It has very little coverage and no oil coverage at all so i would not recommend using this as a makeup. I use this one just to put it on the corner of my eyes to give my eyes a pop.Overall this is a good set for people to choose which is the best BB cream for them. SKIN BB Cream Mini Set,Neutral
I hate hairspray.  That said I really like Eufora's Finishing Spray.  It doesn't weigh down my very fine hair doesn't feel crunchy doesn't feel sticky.  The best part is the fragrance.  I really don't like the smell of hair sprays they compete with perfumes.  This one is quite pleasant and the smell dissipates quickly.  If you have to use hair spray this is a great choice. The Best,Neutral
Some may find the perfume pleasant I certainly didn't find it unpleasant just way too strong.  But I must admin that I'd rather have no smell or a very mild natural smell (like lemon tea tree etc) vs. a chemical perfume addition.  The body wash works very well and left my skin very soft but it's not for me. very moisturizing but heavy perfume,Neutral
I thought I could handle the smell for the sake of healthy or healthy appearing hair but this product just straight up reeks. I have not seen any improvement in my hair since using it the couple times I have but looord does it ever stink. Like putrid old woman perfume. Nadd,Neutral
The Silicon Mix is the best product i have ever used and I am a product junkie. After researching over and over again about the product I decided to give it a try. And I am so glad I did. This product does have a strong perfume scent but does not linger in my hair after I rinse it out like it does for some. I used it in conjunction with the kanechom goat milk brazillian treatmet and my haor texture felt completely different. Thank you for such a fantastic product! A Must Have!,Neutral

I discovered this product the last time I had my hair done at the salon. My mom had an appointment about a week after mine so I told her to ask our stylist what she used on my hair.  My mom purchased a bottle for $ at the salon.  I then found it on Amazon for MUCH cheaper.  It must sell pretty quickly because it seems to come and go in the eligible for free shipping category through Amazon.I have very fine partly wavy/a lot straight natural blond hair.  My mom has dark (now grayed) heavily colored / often treated hair.  It works GREAT on both our hair!!  It is amazing how soft it makes your hair feel.  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of it.  I lean towards perfumes with clean/soapy scents and I would love to have the smell of Moroccanoil in a perfume!!!I use it on wet hair before I blow dry.  I also but a little on the ends after I style my hair to eliminate any dry ends.  I highly recommend this product to people with all types of hair. Great product and smells incredible,great product
Rich but over perfumed. Cannot get in eyes or they will burn! That makes it harder to use and IMO makes it less desirable since product will migrate along skin into eyes. Too much perfume,Neutral
I love this product. I normally don't use products that are not organic and contains perfume but this one is the exception. I am on my second bottle and my skin loves me for it. The only reason I am not giving it  stars is because of the price. Love Love Love,Neutral
Reminds me of liquor filled chocolates or something.  Very nice and unique perfume.  I like it from start to finish.  If it doesn't last that long big deal spray more look at the price it's affordable. Smells like chocolates with liqueor.  Very nice.,Neutral
Absolutely LOVE this perfume!!!  It changes smells the longer you wear it. I would have expected it to cost way more. The price was a bonus!!! Great Buy!,Neutral
How to describe the subjective reason I don't care for this scent? It smells nothing like Angel and is quite old fashioned without being classic. It almost reminds me of body odor. For the price it is worth trying as many people seem to like this perfume however keep in mind there is a reason it is so cheap. Not for me,Neutral
My brother had bought me the Lancme Miracle perfume the purple on my birthday. This perfume by Queen Latifah smells so much smiliar to it. I love this perfume. Smells similar to the Lancme Miracle perfume(the purple one).,Neutral
This is a substantial bottle for the price. It smells nice however I judge a perfume based on whether or not someone tells you that you smell good. I have spent as much as $. on a . ounce bottle of fragrance and not only did no one tell me I smelled good I could not even smell the fragrance. It could be hormonal given the fact of my age. I love fragrance and I really like smelling good. I ordered the body butter and the lotion thinking that I may get better results if I layered the fragrance. The fragrance has excellent reviews but I know that everyone's body chemistry is different. I sprayed the fragrance on early this morning and now I can't smell anything but a lot of the times that does not mean others can't smell the fragrance. It is still an extremely economically feasible deal based on the quantity you get for the price. I am going to wear it but if I am not told that I smell good will not reorder. This may sound vain but if a fragrance truly smells good somebody is going to tell you. Exceptional Value,Neutral
Love this perfume.  It has a great scent that lasts all day long.  I highly recommend to those who love a bit of spice. Great Scent,Neutral
I'm new to the language of perfumes so I won't attempt to describe the fragrance itself; others have done so very well here and on other perfume sites like Fragrantica.This eau de parfum has incredible longevity. I like to put it on around bedtime and it's still quite detectable by morning though of course by then only the last few notes are remaining. It's not the most obviously complex perfume but it has enough going on to keep me interested.Nothing about the bottle or packaging seem cheap. There is an outer sleeve done in red gloss and red foil. The box inside also done in red foil is wrapped in cellophane with straight folds and perfect corners. The interior of the box and the corrugated insert are both black. By the time you draw out the red glass bottle you are feeling very elegant.The bottle feels heavy and substantial the sprayer action is just right creating a directed mist rather than a squirt and the cap seats accurately with a soft click that doesn't sound plasticky. The heart impressions make the bottle feel so good and secure in your hand it's hard to imagine the ergonomic quality is an accident.I'm not sure I'm in love with the scent yet because it's very different from what I usually gravitate to but I am in love with the quality of this item in every respect.Five stars without hesitation. I paid $ for mL including tax and shipping. Class act all the way,Neutral
I'm a fan of Queen Latifah.  She's classy and generally plays in movies you can watch with your family.  I like that.  My guy likes patchouli. Me I'm not a fan of it.  For Valentine's Day I went in search of some patchouli I could tolerate.  Tried an essential. That smelled more like fungus and perfume.  Got some soap.  That was very nice.  He liked it so much he took it home for himself.  This was the best rated perfume and while I wouldn't choose it for myself I do find it's tolerable--not too strong no overly smoky earthy overtones.  It comes in a rather elegant bottle with (surprise!) a heart in the side which I hadn't noticed until I got it.  It comes double boxed.  Not mail gorillas are likely to smash this thing.  There's a generous amount of the stuff.  It should last a long time.  It's worth the price. The best patchouli perfume I've found,long time
This is now one of my very favorite perfumes. I absolutely love it! So sultry and soft yet spicy and sumptuous ... a total package of understated elegance. You can't beat the price either. I can't seem to stop sniffing my wrist with this one that's how enticing it is. Superb fragrance. My husband can't compliment me enough whenever I wear this. He wants to buy me more! It's so nice that I bought a second bottle for my daughter to enjoy. She loves it too. Unbelievably Wonderfully Fragrant,Neutral
This was a Christmas gift for my mom.  I feel in love with the look of the bottle. My mom has this perfume on her dresser out on display.  I love Queen Latifah and I love supporting her as a brand.  I am considering  buying a second bottle for my boyfriend's mom. Queen Latifah!!!,Neutral
Im in love with this perfume I got it at Ross the other day for only $ and i love it. It  smells like mariah's and beyonce's perfume heat put together  witch I don't mind because both scents are great! But if your like me and gravitate to sweet candy like smell then you are really going to like this Oh yesss!,Neutral
I like the color but  this product  burnt my lipso I stopped use this product.smell like perfumery. there are many positive comments but I don't think it is for me. lipsticks,Neutral
All EO Lavender products are amazing because there's nothing artificial or perfume-y about them.  EO = Essential Oils and they make all the difference. Essential Oils make the difference,Neutral
This is good soap no perfume in fact just about no smell at all. It does cloud after a while but that does not impact the cleaning ability or clog the pump. gentle on tender skin,Neutral
I saw a review from a YouTuber about this perfume and I decided.. Why not?  The scent is addictive!  I bought the .oz size and might or might not share it with my fiance.  I sprayed it up in the air and walked into it and the scent is lasting.  I received wondering looks from men and women on the train (Bronx). Luv it!!! Received this order in one day.  Will order from this seller again. Great for women too!,Neutral
I particularly love the smell of this perfume because the smell when sprayed onto the skin changes each time; which leaves you with a new and refreshing scent that's similar but different.  Being that I have always been an avid lover of Paco Rabanne I thought that I would get this brand for a guy friend of mine; being that I had a feeling that it would compliment him wonderfully. I have to say that I was right and he loved his gift. This is a great perfume because it's not too heavy or too musky like a lot of others. It's just the perfect balance.  For those of you interested in getting a gift for your guy friend or husband this is a must have; it's simply divine. Fantastic Perfume.,Neutral
This Edt has a very distinct smell that makes u stand out. A bit strong but not overpowering. This definitely has a clean and fresh smell but I would not describe it as smelling like &#;bubble gum&#; or &#;toothpaste&#; like some have. I would say its has bit of a flower aroma mixed with a clean soap smell. It has strong undertones which makes me highly disagree with people that say it smells like a woman's perfume. This starts off strong and smoothly rolls off after a few hours (maybe not as long as I would like it to). Otherwise I highly recommend this and if you buy it expect compliments! Distinct...,Neutral
I have thick curly hair and this conditioner doesn't have enough moisture for me.  Compared to other conditioners that actually work for my hair this one is very thin.  I also don't care much for the scent it smells kind of like grandma perfume.If you have corse curly hair you might want to consider a different product. Not for everyone,Neutral
I find this a confusing product to review. On the one hand it does a decent job as a shampoo and the fragrance is milder than in many products which is important to me as a person who sometimes gets a headache or other symptoms from perfume. On the other hand some of the ingredients are not totally gentle.The name of the product might fool people who are unfamiliar with the term Hair Milk. It does not mean that there is any dairy product in the shampoo. There is soy milk in this however so if someone in your family is allergic to soy be forewarned.The front label may lead the consumer to think this a natural product. Shea butter soymilk and honey sound wholesome and natural. However the long list of ingredients on the back of the bottle tells a different story. Yes there are botanicals in the shampoo. However there are also a number of chemicals and fragrance components some of which can be allergenic or irritating. Propylene glycol DMDM Hydratoin and limonene can be irritants for instance.  Also benzyl salicylate (which is spelled incorrectly on the Amazon description but which I compared to the label on the product) may be an endocrine disrupter or environmental toxin according to EWG's Skin Deep Cosmetics Database.I'm giving the shampoo four stars anyway because it is just about impossible to find a truly safe shampoo that does a good job. At least this one does not make my scalp itch or burn (and some of the all-natural ones do!) and the scent is not problematic for me. Your mileage may vary. Cleans hair but Possibly Irritating or Allergeni,Neutral
This shampoo gets the job done without leaving your hair covered in perfume. The smell is coconut with a faint chemical smell; not exactly the best but acceptable. Here is a link to the matching conditioner:Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner .-Ounce Bottle Decent shampoo,Neutral
I have a lot of hair. In fact I often joke that I have enough hair for three people because it is very long and thick as well as wavy and somewhat prone to being dry and slightly brittle at the ends. I'm mentioning this because how a conditioner affects ones hair is related to its general tendencies. If you have thin fine or very straight hair this conditioner may or may not affect your hair differently.Since I do have so much hair I use a fair amount of conditioner and have sampled many types. I evaluate each of them based on the how they effect the following: body shine manageability (ease of coming out) texture frizz control/smoothness promotion; I also look at scent price and volume required to do the job.In terms of body this does a very good job of holding and slightly enhancing my hairs natural body. It did not have a flattening effect on my hair. It also promoted good shine which for a moderately priced conditioner is encouraging. I've found that cheap conditioners tend to dull hair especially if you're older as I am (). Effects on texture-softness-were especially good. I think this is the shea butter doing its thing. Smoothness and frizz control could be better but there is an adequate amount.The scent is lovely and natural and lacks the heavy perfume scents of some other conditioners. I don't have to use too much to get the job done. The reason this is a -star instead of a -star product is that the frizz control could be a little better and while this is far from an expensive conditioner it is a smallish size for the price. I think that it also could promote shine somewhat more but generally I think this is a great conditioner for those with younger hair than mine who do not want something which is too overbearing in terms of scent. Hits most of the marks lovely scent,Neutral
This shampoo cleans very well but as often happens with sulfate-free shampoos it seems it has a tendency to leave hair on the dryish side if no conditioner is used. Since the purpose of buying this for me was to complement the excellent MoroccanOil hydrating mask (which is what I use as conditioner) that was not a problem.This shampoo has the same gorgeous fragrance as the conditioner remiscent of anointing oil/incense that ancient Middle Eastern sort of perfumey smell.I took off a star for the slight drying effect and price (expensive!). But if you use the MoroccanOil masks or oil this is good to add to the regimen.I ordered from this seller and had no problem. They delivered promptly with no issues. Very nice shampoo with no sulfates or parabens but you will need a conditioner,Neutral
This is great either just by massaging it to a creamy lather with your hands or I sometimes use it with my Clarisonic.  It never dries my skin or makes it feel tight just leaves behind a wonderful soft cleansed skin.  Doesn't really have any perfume so it's not irritating if it gets too close to your eyes.  Also does a great job of removing left over eye makeup. Cleansing but not drying,Neutral
Returning this has intense smell to it that gave me one of my migraines (I'm sensitive to perfumes) and that isn't mentioned  in the online description. Went to local drug store where I could smell the stuff AND it was cheaper! stinky,Neutral
I bought this  clean face wash because of course I was sold on that little handheld scrubber.I bought the green colored bottle without really paying a whole lot of attention as im someone that just washes my face with any old soap and thought it would be a step up to buy something labeled for your face.OMG did my face break out with pimples everywhere and it was a nightmare.i called loreal because i was shocked that people would want to put this on there face I dont feel particularly sensitive seeing that hand soap is what i used before.luckily loreal gave me a voucher and told me that i should try there sensitive version that is perfume free.i now own and have used it and im satisfied by the product but now wowed.I love the scrubber and its really convient and soft but the product is just ok.I switched to nuetrogena and wont buy loreals again.If you are going to try this face wash please be careful and try the sensitive skin there is no reason to overload your face with crazy chemicals and perfume! You may be trying to recover for a week and a half like i did from the breakout! If you are going to buy this BUY THE SENSITIVE SKIN VERSION!!!!,sensitive skin
This cream is very nice.  It has a really nice feel to it.  I put it on after my shower at night and it sinks right in not greasy.  It has no scent which is great for the morning when I'm going to work and using my own perfume.It instantly makes your face feel very very smooth like baby's skin.I believe in using better quality for your face and this is perfect.  I will continue using it morning and night and when I run out I will be getting more.Great product really nice,Neutral
This cream is too thick and too stinky. It smells too much like a perfume which I hate and it goes on my skin a little to much like a mask. I read somewhere it is part of a four step regime and I only have this product so it could be I am doing the process wrong. I overall do not like the product though I will admit it moisturizes pretty well but feels heavy. Not my favorite,Neutral
This product is made by L'Oreal.  So is my old moisturizer.  I love them both.  However this one doubles as a night cream and it is super moist!  My skin feels moisturized until the next morning when I shower and put it on again.  For aging skin this is a wonderful moisturizer.  What is special about it is that my dry skin feels very lubricated yet I don't break out.  My skin feels like it is balanced as when I was young.  I wondered when I ordered this if it would be a greasy layer on my skin.  I took a chance knowing how well I like L'Oreal skin care products in general.  Now I am barely wrinkled at  years old.  I have frown lines but that is it.  People think I am younger than I am.  I don't know if moisturizer makes that so but I just need a little concealer and moisturizer and bronzer.  Maybe mascara and a little bit of L'Oreal ethereal shadow. The older I get the less makeup I use. I remember seeing an older woman who had stunning skin and she had a little bit of mascara on her upper eyelashes kind of fanning out towards the outer perimeter.  I think of her when I put on makeup.There aren't any perfumes that I detect in this moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin and allergies.  In two weeks I have had no problems. I know people who spend a lot on skin care.  All I use are L'Oreal towelettes an occasional Olay moisturizing scrub and L'Oreal moisturizer. I have a dermabrasion kit that I use occasionally and I will get a cheap facial once a year.  The cost is minimal and one jar or bottle of moisturizer lasts me  year.The only other thing we need is sunblock.  I am very sun-sensitive and I only get sun when walking to and from my car. Believe me that sun is still significant. So really I believe that after thinking this through I will use a light layer of my old inexpensive moisturizer with SPF included during the day and use this Age Perfect product at night after a shower. How is that for a compromise? perfect but no SPF,little bit
I am dry dry dry.  Dry hands mouth eyes skin.  It helps taking oral omega- pills.  But I have been looking for something external forever.  When I saw L'oreal's Age Perfect for very dry skin and anti-sagging I couldn't wait to give it a try.First off this is a very thick cream almost paste.  I hand to warm it up with my hands to make it softer before applying it to my face.  Because it is very perfumy.  I could not apply it anywhere near my eyes without them getting teary.  I also applied it to my neck.  I could immediately notice how soft smooth and supple the skin on the hands were I had extra from the application.  However because the skin on the face is far more delicate it felt heavy.  I decided to `cut' it by adding some Aloe Vera gel which made it feel a bit lighter and I know will extend the cream further.  I also found because of the heaviness it is best to use at night.  During the day the thickness takes a while to absorb which can be a pain if you are applying make-up over and short on time.  It does hydrate but since I am using it in the summer I am curious to see if it will even work better in the cold months.  I am not sure about anti-sagging elements.Overall this cream really protects and keeps the skin soft and supple but its thickness and strong perfume scent may turn off people with sensitive skin. cream really protects & keeps the skin soft & supple but its thickness & strong perfume scent may turn off people with sensitive,dry skin
I'm in my mid s and have dry skin and the start of fine lines and decided to try this even though it's meant for older ladies!  The first thing I noticed is that it's HIGHLY fragranced and reminds me a lot of the perfume my mom used to wear in the s a lot like Opium.  It's very thick and once on made my skin look very shiny and feel a little stifled.  I used this for  days and didn't notice any difference although that amount of time is probably too short to judge.  It was just too heavy to use in the summer!I think this would be VERY good for the winter months when my skin is extra dry so I'm saving it until then.  I will use it at night because I like to use products with SPF during the day.  The box and jar are a little misleading and you don't get much product.  I think using it conservatively you might get  weeks' use out of this.  Amazon's price right now is great but I think if I had to pay full price I would have been a little upset.P.S. I tried this with L'OrealAge Perfecting Eye Balm . Fluid Ounceand this was a great eye cream - nice and thick! Review from a -something with dry skin,dry skin
I've been using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of months now and my hair feels really nice so soft. I have long hair colored light blonde and when I use this no more tangles either which is very nice. It does add body as it says it does and my hair doesn't seem to break as easily as before I used this product. The smell is ok not the greatest but clean and natural not perfumey. I guess I'm used to shampoos like certain Bedhead ones which have a great smell so I am biased. I love that it is so natural with no sulfates too. I just wish this came in bigger sizes! Love this stuff!,Neutral
This is my daughter's favorite perfume.  It's hard to find so I always order her another bottle whenever her birthday or Christmas is coming up. Britney Spears Circus Fantasy Perfume,favorite perfume
Bummer.  I really wanted to love Circus Fantasy.  The original and Hidden Fantasy are two of my favorite perfumes Island and Midnight are both pretty great as well so I guess I had high hopes for Circus.  Once I received the perfume my hopes crashed and burned. Smelled rather average to me like a billion other floral perfumes I've smelled in my lifetime. And I'm not a floral perfume lover. I was hoping to smell the &#;sugar-coated raspberry&#; and &#;violet candy&#; but instead I only smell flowers and just a hint of citrus in the background (which is the only thing still making this a wearable perfume for me). Oh well guess I can't love 'em all! BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...,Neutral
I really like this perfume it has a really great sweet smell to it and the price is really great for the size. Circus perfume,Neutral
I ordered this one without smelling it first because I love Britneys Radiance perfume. I like this one but I don't LOVE it by any means. It's ok. It's kinda sweet but way more citrus than anything else. Was hoping for something sweeter. Lasting power is alright. Very citrusy!,Neutral
so this perfume is sweet. But it's got a bunch of different notes so each one kinda comes up at it's own time.You should definitely like her perfumes before you get this. It's not for everyone i'd say under age . And more of a day time or afternoon scent.Pretty bottle too. sweet and full of surprises,Neutral
Love this perfume .got so many compliments from everywhere I wore this. Five Stars,Neutral
I THINK I LOVE ALL PERFUME THAT SMELL SWEET AND I THINK I LIKE THEM AND ALOT BECAUSE I SEEM TO ALWAYS BUY SWEET SMELLING STUFF AND THIS FITS THE BILL SO IF YOU LIKE CANDY LIKE SMELLS IT'S FOR YOU TOO!!!!!!!!!! SWEET SMELL,Neutral
This stuff smells so nice. Kind of like the Amarige by Givenchy perfume. Makes my hair look great and I love the price. No need to buy the expensive stuff. Love it,Neutral
Seriously I am so disappointed that I can't ever like this product. I was very excited to try this out but the moment I opened the cap I hated it. It has this weird vanilla-ish sweet scent that ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTS me. No offense to those of you guys out there who like the scent but to me this just smells like a really bad man perfume. To make things worst once you touch this liquid the scent doesn't even go away for hours. If it had a good fragrance I would appreciate the long-lasting scent but I washed my hands like  times and I washed my hair (again) because the scent was giving me a headache.If you are sensitive to how things smell like me please try smelling this thing before you buy a large bottle of this.I'm so glad I bought the travel size... HORRIBLE SCENT!!!!!! EW,Neutral
I really truly hoped that this would help repair my very fine very dry very wavy hair. I've been researching argan oil like crazy and almost every source seemed to confirm that it was uniformly fabulous and hydrating for ANY type of hair. I've had problems in the past with hair oil because they all seem to weigh my hair down and turn my  head into a greasy stringy mess. Well unfortunately that's what happened with Agadir.I first spritzed the product on after getting out of the shower wildly excited for it to magically create silky smooth  hair. Well not suprisingly this just turned my hair into a greasy matty mess. Then I tried spraying just a tiny bit into my palm and gently working it into the ends of hair before I used the hair dryer. Oddly the oil just seemed to sit on the outside of my hair and without ever really penetrating it even after I warmed it up. It seemed to actually DRY my hair out.I don't know what the other ingredients are in this product. I don't know to blame my dissatisfaction on them or the argan oil. The only positive thing I can say about it is that the fragrance is kinda nice even if it is a tad perfumey for my taste.In the end I now have a whole bottle of this stuff and absolutely will not put it on my head again. I have that kind of hair that is really hard to please; dry on bottom oily on the scalp fine and wavy (when moisturized frizzy when not). To be fair most products don't work on me. I was really hopeful about this one. So :(. The search continues. Hot oily mess that made my hair even MORE dry,argan oil
This product doesn't do anything the box says it'll do aside from adding a little shine to my hair. It definitely doesn't tame fly aways. It seems to just add some extra tackiness to my hair that makes it snarly faster. Bummer. Won't buy this again. Oh and it smells like you're spraying straight perfume on your hair....like sweet musky strong strong perfume. No bueno. I don't get it...,Neutral
I bought this thru Amazon's Subscribe & Save for my elderly mom.  She loves it.  Many older women and some women in general do not or can not use perfumes.  My mom says that this body wash moisterizes her skin and leaves a fantastic scent.  She loves it. My mom loves this body wash,Neutral
Holds pretty well without stiffness or residue.  Easy to brush out with yanking out my hair.  I've used it for years.  No smell either which is key for me. Love it no perfume,Neutral
The scent is overpowering and lingers. Forget about wearing perfume the hair spray will overpower it. Scent doesn't fade making it very annoying (especially while trying to eat or cook). So while the product was good the overwhelming scent made it seem appropriate for the teenage crowd. Overly fragrant - scent doesn't fade.,Neutral
I purchase Clove Oil and like to use it as perfume. I am fond of the company who makes it Edens Garden and their products are quality.This oil is exactly what I was expecting and I recommend it. Exactly what I was expecting.,Neutral
I really like this cleanser it feels really gentle do not have perfume (which is a plus for me). The skin feels clean but not tight or anything. Very gentle,Neutral
Just got this perfume and I love it! It's long lasting and smells very exotic / oriental. It may be my new favorite. It is dead sexy!,Neutral
I think this perfume smells sweet and nice and simple. It's a little powdery and antique smelling. But I kind of like that about it. It doesn't try too hard to be REALLY flowery or REALLY musky or REALLY sweet. It's a simple scent and kind of old fashioned or retro. Almost like i got into my grandmas perfumes and mixed a couple together and came up with this. Anyway thats what it reminds me of. But that's a good thing i think. Because my grandma always had tons of really old classy perfumes and I think she'd like this one if she was still around. I also got the Dead Sexy hand cream and the Dead sexy lip balm. Dont waste your time with those. They're not worth the money. TokyoMilk is great for their perfumes but the quality of their other products is mediocre.Next I am going to get Honey and the Moon perfume because I had a sample of that and I love how honey smells. Great perfume,Neutral
When collagen breaks down peptides are released into the dermis.  Peptides signal the dermal system to produce more collagen.  This product with four peptides seems promising at first glance.  After all if we can improve collagen production we're protecting the structure of our skin.There are many products that contain peptides on the market.  Fytofontana promises results because this product contains not only a variety of peptides but several other ingredients like retinol sodium hyaluronate and phospholipids.  Beyond these considerations there are a number of shortcomings to consider.The first problem is dispensing the product.  The cap must be pumped and removed so you can dispense the product from a pipette.  Two problems here:  What if you knock over the bottle and spill the product?  And the bottle is not opaque.  Exposure to air and light diminish the efficacy of retinol.Second this product contains a lot of fragrance in the form of perfume and essential oils.  This will certainly cause problems for many users experienced as irritation or allergic reaction.Because there are many serums available that do contain peptides and the other beneficial ingredients mentioned that have opaque airtight packaging I do not recommend this serum.  I have used it for several weeks with no improvement in the appearance of my skin.  This could have been a contender but it isn't. Liquid Gold,Neutral
Boy howdy this didn't come with much in the way of instructions.  It just says to apply and let dry before using any cosmetics.  That made me think that it was only supposed to be used once a day even though many products of this type are to be used twice a day. I decided to see what I could find on the internet so I checked out the company's website. Indeed this product is supposed to be used twice a day. It would have been nice if they mentioned it in the information brochure that's included with the product.I've used this twice a day for a month and honestly I can't see any difference in my skin.  I only used it on one side of my face and I have a  times magnifying mirror so I can get a good look and I don't see any change at all.  Even if it did work I wouldn't be inclined to buy it.  Yes there are products that are even more expensive than this but in the grand scheme of things this is pretty expensive.  I also have an issue with the bottle.  The neck of the bottle isn't much bigger than the pipette. If I'm not very careful about putting the pipette back in the bottle it scrapes the side of the neck and the product runs down the outside of the bottle. Messy.  This product is very perfumed. It wouldn't be such an issue but it's right there by my nose and although the odor fades as time goes by it's there all day and night. Even if this product did improve my skin just for that reason alone I wouldn't buy it. Combined with the difficult dispenser and the price I can't recommend this product. Not Recommended,Neutral
Lola is my new favorite scent and I was so excited to find it at almost half the price of what you'd find it at Sephora or other retailers. It's nice to have the large bottle since I use it almost every day. My favorite perfume at a great price!,favorite perfume
Really unique bottle stands out on my dressing mirror. When I first bought this perfume I did not really like it. However it has become my everyday fragrance. It doesn't exactly have a fantastic lasting power on me but I like the softness. It smells even better when combined with the lotion. I recommend this. Lola!,Neutral
I absolutely love this fragrance. I thought I loved Very Sexy but this is so much better. It's more floral and less spicy. It's a gentle tease of a fragrance. Suitable for year long wear day or night dressy or casual. Not too fanciful for the office but ageless. It doesn't smell like a teenage girl's idea of a nice perfume but it doesn't smell like a grandmother either.The only thing I would change about it is how long it lasts. Normally perfume lasts forever on me. Even after EDTs last a long time on me. This perfume will last - hours at the most when usually any perfume will last at least  hours  or more if its a high quality fragrance. Now I only wear it if I know I will be able to reapply as needed or if I'm only going out for a short while. Gorgeous Fragrance,long time
Sexy Little Things Noir is a wonderful scent but the packaging needs to be reworked. While the pump is vintage and fun I found that mine stopped working after awhile. I'm wasn't even halfway through the bottle. I've tried fixing it but ultimately I think I'm going to have to transfer the remainder of the perfume into a cheap dollar store spray bottle.I've switched to the Sexy Little Things Noir Body Mist and it works perfect. Cute but impractical -buy the Body Mist Instead,Neutral
I really really really love this perfume it's authentic and it smells very good It's diffrent from others and inexpensive. love it,Neutral
This scent is nice but you can tell it is made very cheaply.  I have other scents that are not even eau de parfum but rather eau de toilette (which is not as strong or long lasting as eau de parfum) and they last  x's longer!  If you apply this in the morning like I do before I go to work by the time you make it to your job it is as if you are not even wearing any scent at all.  I do not at all recommend this for that reason.  I notice this with most victoria's secret sccents.  I don't know what it is.  But I will be sticking with my french perfumes from now on. nice but doesn't last,Neutral
This is a great little soap. It is gentle enough to use on the face as it contains both moisturizing cream and mild exfoliants. As it is marketed to menit has a strong woodsy/green aroma. I personally prefer the freshness one finds in most men's fragrances. I liked this one but  less is more. Although the scent dissipates somewhat it is still quite noticeable. Therefore I think it is better used as a body bar than a facial cleanser.My experience with Dove products has been positive. They are good quality and reasonably priced. I think most men would be receptive to skin care but I think that subtle fragrance is more appealing than aggressive perfumes. Strongly Scented Soap,Neutral
Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Deep clean has a very neutral odor best described as simply soapy with no noticeable perfume except for maybe the slightest hint of sandalwood so it is not so much masculine as definitely not feminine. It cleans quite well but has moisturizers so it doesn't leave the face feeling dry but rather soft and smooth. There are some visible small black purifying grains in the ivory-colored bar but perhaps also something else that provides a very gentle exfoliation. This bar is ideal for both men and for women who don't like strongly-perfumed soaps. Neutral moisturizing soap,Neutral
This product is ideal for someone who is allergic to perfumed soaps; however if you prefer the more fragrant type of soaps this is not for you. This is definitely a man's bar of soap. No recognizable scent and strong enough to get you clean without leaving your skin dry. The granules ebmedded in the soap are great for as the label says a deep clean. Dove Men Care Soap,Neutral
Well knock me over.  Here's a men's bar that I really like for myself.  First the scent is wonderful.  Fresh without being overly perfumey.To give you an idea of how scented it is we received some of the DoveDove Men Care Body and Face Wash--Clean Defenseand while I liked it on my man there's no way I would personally use it.  The scent was just over-powering in the shower.This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)Second I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.So definitely would recommend. Wonderful Smell,dry skin
This has a stronger scent than I would expect from a Dove product but it lessened once I used it with water and washed up. It feels nice and does a good job.As mentioned the scent is strong but lessens when you use the soap. It is hard to describe the scent. It is not a perfume or cologne scent but more of a clean soap smell. I can smell it on my hands after using the soap and it smells fine.The soap is slightly rounded and shaped so it is easy to hold and easy to use on my body. The color is not the clean white you get in some Dove soaps but a darker color that I would expect in a product that has purifying grains.This feels great on my skin and leaves a clean smell after use. I really like this. Works Well and Leaves A Nice Smell,Neutral
To test & review this properly I planned on using this until it disintegrated but after a week of forcing myself to put up with the scent I'd had enough. Yes some people rave about the smell but to me it's just awful. And it sticks with you (I can smell it on my hands right now  hours after using it). Of course smell is relative so I can't give this a poor review on that alone. I do however think it's fair to deduct one star because of the cloying & lingering fragrance chemicals used and I'll base the rest of the review on the advertised claims vs my experiences.Overall I found absolutely nothing special about this product. It hasn't made my skin look or feel any better than any other similar product I've used and it costs roughly the same as what I normally use.Looking at their advertised claims:Purifying grains clean deeper and Purifying exfoliants renew skin - nonsense (and poor grammar). It contains a small amount of tiny grains of salt. The amount of exfoliating & deep cleaning they can actually do is miniscule especially when compared to using an exfoliating sponge or loofa etc.Feels better than regular soap - a meaningless claim. Feels better how and by whom and how are they defining regular soap?Speaking of soap notice they never once call this soap. They can't legally call this soap because it's not soap; it's a detergent. To be called soap it has to be entirely comprised of natural ingredients and since this Body and Face Bar is primarily synthetics (dyes perfumes chemicals etc.) it's not soap though they do use some natural ingredients like sodium tallowate (rendered beef fat) and microcrystalline wax (petroleum refinery byproduct)./ moisturizing cream - what does that even mean? / cup? Tablespoon? Milligram? It's not a typo; that's what it says in the ad blurb at the top and it says the same thing in the Product Description and the same thing on the product packaging and the same thing on their website... And what's the moisturizing ingredient? Are they referring to the beef fat?After reading more about all of the listed ingredients I decided I'll be throwing this bar of stink in the trash when I get home today. Smelly bar of non-soap detergent,Neutral
First of all I'm not a dude. But I am the wife of a dude.And as the wife of a dude I like my personal dude to smell fantastic.But not cologne-y and not like a bottle of knock-off drakar noir exploded in his midst.AND because I am demanding. I like his skin to feel soft and smooth.Dove Men + Care definitely left his skin soft and smooth- for that I would give it maybe  or  stars... My husband uses regular bar Dove quite a bit and if anything this seemed to rinse cleaner...The fragrance though... I give that a  (by the way I love the fragrance of regular Dove).It's an odd match for a dude...  It's more than a hint of perfumey fabric softener fairly chemical-y.  As far as comfort goes- the fragrance was so strong that it was not comforting in the least but I have a very sensitive nose and sensitive skin and with the combination of the two I ordered my beloved back into the shower to hose himself off with plain ol' awesome Dove bar....Perfection! And now he smells clean and that is sexy. Clean and soft but....,sensitive skin
Ok to tell you the truth after a read Mad Max's review with a discussion of all the chemicals in this product I am just a wee bit scared of this stuff. Are all these things necessary in something to bathe in?I have a couple of other issues with it as well. Personally I thought the smell of it was very strong. Yes I guess they want it to smell manly but this stuff was rather overpowering.Wouldn't it just be easier to make something with a very faint odor or no scent that perhaps the entire family could use and then if you would like to add a scent to oneself...aftershave or cologne or perfume depending on ones gender you could choose to do so. All these layers of scent seem just a bit much.And I also think the packaging is awkward. Rather overpowering,Neutral
Not too much to add to the title. -stars cuz it works no more cuz it's too smelly for my use. This seems like a product in search of a niche. I mean soap works right?My predominant shower soap isClearly Natural Soap Glycerine Peppermint  oz ( Multi-Pack)(and other flavors). I started using glycerin soap when I found out that it cleans as well as regular soap but doesn't leave soap scum to muck up the bath/shower. When I saw this as a choice on Vine I thought What the heck? Give it a try. You can always clean off the scum.This product cleans well and leaves a slippery feeling to the skin (we have softened water) when rinsed off but it leaves a very obvious aftershave-like smell: it actually work me up several times during the night the one-time I used it to shower with. So no more showers with this for me! However I am using it during the day to wash the old armpits. It really does clean and de-smellify well.Added after reading the previous reviews: there is a technical problem with the container. The lid is on the bottom and not easy to open when your hands are wet. Also if you use it at the sink (like I do for my armpits) the stuff drips out when you open it - OK in the shower but not at the sink. Too much perfume for me... cleans well though.,Neutral
I purchased this body and face wash for my son and he loves the fresh clean smell. Not perfumery nor overly cloying just a clean scent. Dove is known for its years of soap and cleansers.The PR for Dove tells us &#; it is clinically proven to fight skin dryness better than regular men&#;s body wash. This ultra-light formula deep cleans with purifying grains then rinses off easily for total skin comfort.&#; What my son has found Is a mild exfoliant to help scrub away dead cells one of few body washes I've come across that does. It has a scent but it is far from overpowering. Develops a decent lather.This is the best He has found so far and He has tried A LOT of body washes. He was using Aveeno's daily moisturizing body wash but that has now become his nd favorite. It leaves skin feeling clean hydrated and refreshed!Recommended. prisrob -- Clean Scent,Neutral
I selected this for my husband to try. He said there was barely any lather compared to other body washes that he's used. Lather doesn't necessarily make you any cleaner but the lack of suds was a negative.The big positive was the scent. My husband doesn't like smelling like a piece of fruit but I am very sensitive to strong scents (ex: perfume cologne). Body wash scents likeAxe Revitalizing Shower GelorOld Spice High Endurance Body Washtrigger an allergic reaction in me. I'm happy to say that this men's body wash from Dove isn't too strong to be around but my husband wasn't impressed with it -- he thought it didn't really have a distinguishing scent.Overall it will get your man clean but Dove hasn't really won us over with this one. Husband said It was OK.,Neutral
I have extremely sensitive skin as I was recently diagnosed with psoriasis.  I've been on the hunt for a nice smelling soap that won't irritate the skin.  I was already a fan of Dove soap but I love the smell of shea butter.  Accidentally saw this and had to try it.  I just love it and will continue to buy this for the whole family from now on.I'm honestly not sure why people are saying it's too much of a perfume smell.  The smell is the best part.  It's a light scent not overbearing and the entire family can use it.  The price is great too!  I highly recommend it. Fantastic soap!  The smell is wonderful and we love it!!!,sensitive skin
This wash has a very light scent. it smells more like the jasmine and thats fine with me. It is moisturizing and it complements my perfume. Smells nice.,Neutral
I have been using Dove for the past  years and I love the Deep Moisture and the Cucumber bodywashes. But I do not favor the cream oil one. It comes out way too thick and the scent is heavily perfumed. I will always by the first ones I mentioned but I would avoid the cream oil bodywashes if you don't like a heavy heavy perfume scent. I love Dove but don't favor their cream oil line.,Neutral
Gift for my daughter. Using the gift list on Amazon saves me every time and I was able to purchase this perfume for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and when applying it my other daughter smelled it and asked for it for her birthday. So I purchased it twice. MMMMM smells so good,Neutral
After looking around for a new fragrance I decided on this one by Michael Kors. I fell in love with the scent and the price so I was sold! Being a fragrance buff I have come across seldom perfumes that are floral-y and modern at the same time. This particular scent is delicate fresh chic and edgy all wrapped into one. However I was a bit (or should I say a lot) disappointed at how long this scent lasts. An hour after spraying it the scent was completely gone. I think I'll start carrying it around in my handbag for quick reapplications throughout the day which sucks because it's a . oz bottle and will be gone quickly. Love the scent not so much the power.,Neutral
Light and lovely this perfume was just perfect.  I especially loved the bottle.  Too bad they decided to discontinue it. Too bad they discontinued this fragrance,Neutral
I remember trying Olay Regenerist Day Cream many years ago and mostly what I recall was that it was too thin and watery and felt like it didn't really hydrate my skin. This new formula is totally different. The face cream is very thick and leaves skin feeling soft and moist which becomes important as the skin ages. Not to mention my skin does look a bit younger and refreshed. I'm mid-thirties and have a few fine lines that are noticeably less visible since I've been using this product. It's certainly not a miracle worker but as far as skin creams go this is the best I've ever used (and I do not say that lightly.) I've used many alpha-hydroxy creams that did not produce results as good as this Regenerist Trio pack has.Typically I steer clear of scented formulas since my skin is so sensitive to perfumes in creams but thankfully I have not had any type of breakout from the fragrance in this. It does smell nice and I'm glad to be able to wear a scented face cream that doesn't cause me to get a rash all over my face.The eye cream is very similar to the face cream; thick and hydrating leaving my skin feeling moist.The face wash has micro beads that act like scrubbers to help slough off the dead skin cells. It does a very good job and I've also been using it on my chest and shoulders to get ready for summer. Also nice to use BEFORE applying sunless tanner to get an even tone.I'm very happy with this and will purchase a new set when I run out. Face Cream is Thick and Hydrating Just how I like it!,Neutral
While the product felt nice and cooling on application it has such an overwhelming fragrance that I had to return it. If you are sensitive to heavily perfumed product I would definitely recommend that you remove from the box and do a whiff test before purchasing. It has that very strong over the top cheap artificial green tea scent to me that lingers until you shower. Unfortunately it's so strong it will even over-power your favorite perfume or fragrance. If you find the scent pleasing give it a try because it does glide on nicely and according to other reviewers I suspect that it is effective for the reduction of cellulite. Regretfully I could not tolerate the fragrance. I had to return,favorite perfume
The Dove site boasts that this conditioner is fortified with fiber actives. What is that?  I question it because I don't see anything in this conditioner that is going to repair hair and rebuild protein.  It is full of things that COAT hair: mineral oil petrolatum multiple silicones an acrylate polymer......um hello?!?!  I don't see any protein in this product - NONE.  Maybe I missed it and I wouldn't mind it if someone proves me wrong because I really want to like this conditioner but I don't see ANY!Also it is VERY perfumey in my opinion. I thought it smelled really good while I was using it in the shower but as the day went on the scent was overpowering and became annoying.  It smelled like I had rinsed my hair with fabric softener or something.  Considering fragrance is pretty high on the ingredient list I am not surprised.  TURN DOWN THE PERFUME DOVE!!It does contain Gluconolactone which I had never heard of until now and it looks like it might help with hair moisture and help those who have hard water (like me). It also contains the normal conditioning agents that most conditioners have like cetearyl alcohol and behentrimonium chloride.  But those aren't extraordinary.  Based on the claims on the Dove site I just assumed this was a product that contained actual ingredients that repair hair.After I rinsed my hair it did feel nice. But I know this is because of all the ingredients that coat and give the illusion of repair. And I guess there's nothing wrong with that when needed.  And because it is a 'daily' conditioner as the name shows I do think it is good for a quick rinse out conditioner.  But I DO NOT feel that it should be relied upon for damaged hair in need of true repair.  Try to find something that has protein in it because I think the results from this one are just a cover up. Not sure there are any repairative ingredients in this.,Neutral
This Suave shampoo not only smells nice and is not too overwhelming or perfume-y (a pet peeve) I also experienced the promised tingle (invigoration) to my scalp.Suave claims that this shampoo is salon proven to invigorate as well as Aveeda and the shampoo bottle states that the Suave formula is invigorating clean for all hair types.  To my normal hair this shampoo is a hit.  I really like the formula because it has a nice pleasant smell & leaves my hair clean & shiny.  I will buy it again.Recommended. Subtle Scent.  Minty Tingle. Nice Shampoo.,Neutral
I love everything Linda Rodin represents. She has such beautiful skin that it drew me in to trying this product. I do love the smell and the dewy shine it creates. But I didn't quite see the results I was hoping for. Regardless it is nice to use as a perfume from time to time. Linda Rodin you keep doing your thing! Alright,Neutral
This is the most delightful perfume. I had read the reviews about how wonderful it is. Finally decided to give it a try and ordered on Amazon. There is something about Fancy Love that is so different. I own several perfumes that are more expensive but find this is the only one I reach for everyday. It feels like a signature scent. There is something very soothing and pretty about it. I am even ignoring my Victor and Rolf Flowerbomb! Ordering a backup and don't ever want to run out of this scent. The reviews are correct!,Neutral
Before I bought this one I had ordered a oil scented perfume (of a company who makes designer scents but uses their secret oils.) and the smell was DIVINE!! Smelled eXACTLY like this...except the real perfume had too much of an alcohal/musky scent.I believe that whoever designed this perfume had a perfect plan in mind. However when spraying it it is a nice lovely peachy/creamy scent..BUT..then something goes slightly wrong...this musky alcohal scent just seems to over power it way too much.If only they would've not included that horrible musky overflow..such a pretty scent..but I find the oil perfume I have from this scent smells even better..too bad because I REALLY wanted to like it..and I do..but the musk just overpowers me for my taste.I LOVE her original Fancy--as I am a HUGE gourmand lover and LOVE anything that smells sweet and creamy. This one was so close..but they should've made it more sweet and less musky..:( Lovely...but too musky..,Neutral
I am honestly not a Jessica Simpson fan but I happened to pick up a tester of this perfume and absolutely loved it.  It is soft and feminine almost soapy but with a slightly spicy kick.  To me it's like the perfect halfway point between wearing something ultra-girly and innocent like Love's Baby Soft and a very spicy sexy musk.  My only complaint is that it doesn't last all day on me maybe - hours.  I have the same issue with many perfumes so it's not a huge drawback and may not apply to other wearers.  I've received quite a few compliments on this scent and my husband really likes it too.  The . oz bottle came in an unopened package although the package for the . oz is a white-on-white damask design and does not have a picture of Jessica Simpson on it as shown here (this was actually a bonus for me but might disappoint her fans).  The bottle is large and prettier in person.  I recommend this fragrance! very nice scent,Neutral
The descriptions of sweet or powdery are not accurate. This is a citrusy fresh scent very similar to regular Burberry perfume which i have owned previously & unfortunately I am not a fan of. It is long lasting and the masses love it. Perfect for day wear.  I am unlike most. Therefore if you usually go against the grain get another scent. citrus notes,Neutral
I love this product! Has lasted me over a year now!Everywhere I go I have strangers asking me what perfume I'm wearing.I just love it smells fantastic! Amazing!,Neutral
This is my absolute favorite perfume. Even over Michael Kors Marc Jacobs and Issey Miyake. I did not buy this from Amazon. The bad reviews seem to be on the seller and not the frangrance. This last forever on me my clothes and my room smells like it for days. Has almost a pineapple smell to me sometimes but in a good way. The best celebrity perfume ever. Love love love this perfume. Can't believe it is from Jessica Simpson but she really nailed this one! My favorite perfume of all time,favorite perfume
There's nothing to not love about this perfume except perhaps I wished it projected more. But as an everyday scent this is amazing. It's so cuddly smooth and creamy and will stay on your clothes forever (normally I do not spray scents on my clothes but this works wonderfully on them all the creamy notes just cling to the fabric and never leave! mmm) This is my new favorite perfume and will be a staple in my collection for years to come. AMAZING,favorite perfume
I was so surprised how good this fragrance smells. I am a perfume person I own so many and am constantly trying new ones. I have bought many online without knowing what they smell like and a lot of the time I am disappointed but not with this one. Fancy Love smells so good I just love it it reminds me of an expensive perfume that my boyfriend bought me from Hermes it is wonderful. It also stays on for quite a long time very important I have very expensive perfumes that only stay for - minutes. This one is a winner!!! Love it,long time
I was a bit worried about purchasing this but figured why not? It is a good price and I figured if I did not like it I could give it to a friend. Luckily I love it. It is the most beautiful smell but in a weird way. I really don't know how to describe it. After first I didn't know if I loved it or hated it so I waited and then used it again. The smell is so romantic it reminds of a weekend getaways in login cabin where you just relax in front of a fire and drink wine. I know that sounds so odd especially when it comes to perfume but it is just so romantic. My husband even likes it which was a huge shock but he said the same thing about it smelling romantic. There are few perfumes I wear that people compliment it and ask what I am wearing; this is one of the few. I got my hair done and the hair dresser kept sniffing and finally asked what I was wearing when I told her she was actually really surprised. I was too because I did not think that Jessica Simpson would have created something like this and sell it for so inexpensive. I recommend this scent to those who really enjoy that warmer smells if that makes sense. I would definitely purchase this again. So unique and beautiful,Neutral
I love this perfume smells so good!!!! Smelt it on a customer at work and have been loyal ever since! Must try! Nice!,Neutral
I am one of those who does not like change when it comes to perfume.  I have owned the same scents for years.  Pleasure Clinique Happy Clinique Happy Heart and Cool Water are my favorites but when I smelled this scent on my sister I loved it.  I went to Belk's within that week to purchase it and have no regrets.  I love this scent and have received many compliments.  It is absolutely my favorite and I wear it just about everyday.  Love it!! Love this perfume!,Neutral
I love this perfume by Jessica Simpson. I do not know what the Fancy perfume smells like but the new line of Fancy Love is absolutely amazing. There is a combination of ingredients which when smelled make you want to giggle and feel sexy and vibrant all at the same time. It is a very warm romantic scent. I am sure each person will smell differently in it but I absolutely adore this perfume. Even my fiance loves it! I apologize if this isn't very articulate I am not very good at explaining scents. Wonderfully Warm and Sumptuous,Neutral
I purchased this perfume based on rave reviews I  read online without having smelled it in advance.If there was ever a safe blind buy for a perfume this would be it. This is a very clean and inoffensive scent - slightly flowery but not overly done a bit powdery and musky just the right amount of creamy sweetness and warm and amber-y on the dry down. A reviewer on fragrantica described this perfume as a &#;fluffy clean blanket&#; and to me that is absolutely spot on. Some people also detect a hint of vanilla though I don't get that.This feels like a very intimate and romantic scent - because of that I'll be using this perfume for date night. In addition it is perfect for those who are incredibly sensitive to smells (like my significant other is) because it is so light and inviting; you really have to get close to smell it.The reason this fragrance got  stars though is because part of the fragrance fanatic in me finds it a bit uninteresting because it IS such a crowd pleaser. My latest absolute favorite perfume is Thierry Mugler's Womanity a completely polarizing and unique scent that is unforgettable but one that can be too intense to wear ever day especially to the office.So if you're looking for that one scent most people will enjoy go for this perfume - I doubt anyone at your work will complain unless you douse yourself in it or something. If you want your perfume to make a statement or make you stand out in a crowd though I don't think this perfume is the one for that. A Crowd-pleasing Soft Feminine Fragrance,Neutral
I bought this after smelling it in the store. It is a wonderful light and clean. it is rather a fancy scent too. after I bought it it was gone in  months. I love it that much. but with all perfumes I advise you go smell it first before you buy it. Fancy,Neutral
I can't tell if this is a fake or not as I haven't smelled it at the store. I can say it doesn't smell like peaches and cream to me or any of the notes listed on some of the perfume web sites. It smells kinda cheap and has that phony burnt-popcorn aroma that a lot of cheap perfumes have. It also had no staying power (not that I'd want it to..) for an EDP. I dunno. The box was lovely bottle was clearly real and no signs of tampering. Could be real. I don't like it though :( Knock Off?,Neutral
THIS SMELLS A LITTLE SOFTER THAN FANCY YET STILL SWEET AND GOOD I LOVE HER WHOLE LINE OF PERFUME AND SHE KNOWS PERFUME CAUSE THIS WHOLE LINE SMELLS GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! A SOFTER SMELL,Neutral
i own quite a few perfumes and i get the most compliments on this one... and you cant beat the price.. smells so pretty and delicate... my fave perfume for sure! MY FAVE,Neutral

I paid  bucks for the .Ounce Givenchy Play and this is either a defective item or fake! I spray  times and it fades in less than an hour....I went to Macys to try test what the exact same one there and it was a lot stronger in smell compared to what I got from Perfumespot and it also lasted me -hrs. This is a serious ripoff...I asked The Perfume Spot about my issue and they just told me everyone has different body chemistry blah blah blah...I've owned  colognes in the past and they all lasted me at least - hours through out the day and you can smell it on your shirt/jacket at the end of the day. The Perfume Spot better refund me the money because I'm very disappointed. Bad Product from The Perfume Spot,Neutral
I love scented spritzing waters.  Perfume or cologne can be too heavy in the summer and early fall months.  If I wear either I swear I become a bug magnet!  Dove Body mists are light not overpowering. One is kept in the bathroom bedroom and even the hall closet. Walking by the closet is an excuse to refresh myself with a spritz just because.  Love doing that.  Will order again and recommend to anyone who comments on how lovely my &#;perfume&#; is. Go to spritz,Neutral
Not at all heavy or strong. I can spray away and only get a nice fresh clean soft scent. I have a bottle at work and one at home. This is great stuff and is my favorite fragrance of the Dove Mist line. I really don't feel the need to spend money on perfume anymore though I do still love J'adore. Fresh and Refreshing,Neutral
I love this natural lotion for the nice soft shimmer it gives my skin (I like to use it in the summer - looks wonderful on tanned skin). Lovely light refreshing scent not overpowering or too perfumey. It has a slightly sticky feeling which is why it's good for summer when I have more bare skin not covered by fabrics. But once it sinks into skin any tackiness disappears & just leaves skin feeling dewy & fresh. The lotion is thin in consistency & is easy to spread but for best results I've learned not to overapply. I like to apply it to my bare arms & legs & occasionally on my chest/neck. I don't generally use this on my face but if you need face shimmer in a pinch this would make a great go-to product.Paraben-free & phthalate-free - excellent! Not as expensive as it used to be in years past (I think) you get a lot of lotion for the price & it lasts a long time. I like to write the date on products when I open them & I still have my tube from July  - I have maybe / left (& it hasn't turned rancid). Talk about cost-effective! If you use it year-round it will run out quicker of course; as I said I only use this in the summer (plus any other dress-up occasions that call for glowing skin). I like the squeeze-tube packaging - it's easy to handle although you should be careful for the lotion to not spill out it's quite liquidy. Shimmer girl loves this lotion,long time
I generally like Burt's Bees products.  They contain decent ingredients and most seem to really work well.  They even have some decent scents to them.  But this one just didn't do it for me.The body wash is advertised as being exfoliating.  There was no exfoliating going on here.  In fact it didn't even really lather.  Which left me feeling less than clean as it was just kind of like swirling lotion around on my skin without rubbing it in.  So then I tried the bath bubble test which is normally how I get rid of products that don't work well on a poof.  It even failed at that as it produced a minute amount of bubbles and they disappeared quickly.  All I can really say is that my skin was nicely scented after using this product.  I also should note that it says it has royal jelly and jojoba beads in the product.  I can believe the jelly but I didn't see any beads while using the product.And the scent is nice.  Just kind of a light floral scent that definitely isn't overpowering.  In fact you don't even smell it unless you lift your arm up and sniff it.  So you won't be knocking anyone out with the perfumed scent if you try this product.  The ingredient were mostly natural too to produce the scent.  Although there were a few in there that I couldn't pronounce.  And the same applies to all the ingredients.  It was a rather lengthy list for a Burt's Bees product.I wouldn't buy this body wash again.  Maybe one of their other ones.  But there just wasn't anything to go back for with this particular product.Review by M. Reynard  Burt's Bees Exfoliating Body Wash,Neutral

Men love White Shoulders.  A man who could not tell Chanel from Chloe will remember a girlfriend from his youth who wore this magic potion. White Shoulders is that perfect blend of flowers and flirtation. It's not overwhelming there is nothing here to startle a shy romeo...but once he takes that first innocent sniff he's hooked.The House of Hartnell introduced White Shoulders  at the end of the second world war.  After so many years their men were coming home and women wanted to welcome them with something lighter and flirtier than those heavy european perfumes. Hartnell was a classic American designer of the era and White Shoulders was the first classic American fragrance feminine but not girlish strong but not blatant.  It is a perfect floral blend of roses gardenia jasmine and lilac sparked with a little hint of orange.But there is more to White Shoulders than that pretty little bouquet.  First there is a good bit of tuberose. This earthy fragrance was considered too suggestive for decent women during the Victorian era...one tiny sniff it was rumored had a devastatingly aphrodesiac effect on maidens.  This may or may not be true but it certainly seems to work that way on the most unmaidenly of males. A good hit of amber a little bit of pheremonal civet and musk and a touch of oakmoss and sandalwood give the fragrance a depth and sophistication not usually found in something this floral.For more than seventy years White Shoulders has remained a favorite. It may be the perfume men buy most often for the women in their lives.  The House of Hartnell disappeared in the s but the fragrance was acquired by Evyan and  later became part of the Elizabeth Arden fragrance collection.  It has never lost its popularity and that trademark cameo on peach background has achieved iconic status.  Although it is deep enough to be classified as a nighttime scent the bright gardenia and orange zest give it an ambiguity and a timelessness that is almost unequaled.  There are fragrances that are more blatant but none have the unforgettable allure of White Shoulders.It is sufficiently festive for special occasions delicate enough for the office and tantalizing enough for seduction. Subtlety is always sexy.  A bare white shoulder is an invitation to temptation. So is this perfume. The Unforgettable Fragrance...,little bit
I am guessing that my mom bought this for me when it first came out.  I wasn't even sure what it was short of decadent and I was afraid to use it daily because it seemed so precious.  Now nearly  years later I am still smitten with everything about it.  The glimmery sheen is the opposite of trashy and it feels so posh.  It's subtle and perfectly appropriate for daytime wear at the office.  The scent is lovely but incredibly light and therefore does not clash with my perfume. I am an avid sunless tanner and I love how a swipe of this down the center of my shins acts like a highlighter on cheekbones.  And while I miss the very large original tin I find that this smaller one is easier to travel with.  I hope they never discontinue this item.  No combo of products I own can recreate the magic in this lovely tin. The perfect bit of sheen for every season,Neutral
I fell upon this scent when shopping at Kohl's and I have been purchasing it ever since (going  years strong). I like to alternate between crisp masculine colognes at work and girly tempestuous scents at play. Hearts and Daggers is definitely my Eau de Parfum for the more casual parts of my life. I wear it clubbing at the gym and on the go. Head to a department store and spray a bit of this ravishing perfume onto a sample stick. I guarantee you'll make the purchase. For those of you out there looking for a signature scent to waft behind you reminding others of your mystique and good taste--look no further. Intoxicating Allure,Neutral
No matter what you think of the Tom Hardy brand this perfume is delicious! Very fruity with a bit of floral. Not too sweet smelling which I hate. I get compliments on this a lot! Great perfume for spring and summer. The bottle is well made and sturdy. I keep it in my purse and it gets knocked around a LOT and not a crack in it. Much much cheaper than what the department stores sell this for and this is the real thing. When I run out I'll for sure get another bottle. I hope amazon does not stop selling this or the other Tom Hardy perfumes. LOVE LOVE this perfume!!,Neutral

I bought this perfume on amazon.com and it was pretty cheap considering the size of it. I love the smell but it doesnt linger very long. The scent will stay on your clothes for a while. this product was delivered reasonably quick. I would recommend this to a friend. lovely smell,Neutral
I ordered this product for my daughter on Christmas. It is a little pricey but she absolutley loves this fragerance. Being a man I must admt many womens perfumes smell bad to me but this one smelled very nice Awesome,Neutral
I love this perfume.  I couldn't find anything I liked when I finally found this one.  It smells great.  Even hours after applying it I can still smell it.  I get compliments all the time.It's not over powering and does fade slowly through the day.  I like to spray it in my hair and in the inside of my elbow.  This helps the scent linger longer. Smells great long lasting,Neutral
This is a terrific cream that I use both under my moisturizer and also on its own.  A little goes a long way to making my skin feel and look smooth radiant and happy.  After  months I can say that I am hooked on this serum and the wonderful results I have achieved.When I needed more I did some pricing comparisons between Amazon and Macy's.com to be sure that I was getting good value for my money.  We all know how fabulous Amazon is with fair pricing and outstanding customer service but in this case I was dealing with another vendor named AZPerfume.  I can't begin to tell you how fabulous this vendor is.My product arrived ahead of schedule securely packaged  in a beautiful white box with a lovely lavender ribbon tied around the outside.  It was literally the icing on the cake.  If you have an opportunity to purchase anything from this Vendor please do not hesitate. Not only will you save a ton of money but you can't beat the presentation.  This AZ Perfume really cares about the customer. Fantastic Product Terrific Price Outstanding Vendor,long way
If you want a perfume that does not need reapplying through out the day this is for you! I will admit that when first applied it is a little strong but after a sec or two it mellows out into a nice fragrance. The price is great also and it arrived within the scheduled delivery time. The only problem is that when sprayed the product does leak some. But other than that I will be ordering more of this perfume. A great product!,great product
I think this is my favorite perfume ever!!! I love it!! So yummy! I get compliments all day long when I wear it! I keep smelling my own wrists! Can't wait to try their other scents! Yummy!,favorite perfume
Saw a review on YouTube about this product I read the description of this product and knew it was a scent that I would e interested in. When I received my package the perfume smells amazing but the only dwn fall is that the scent didn't last at all. So disappointed and I had already felt like what I paid for it was too much for the small amount. Being tht the scent doesn't last I probably will not order a full size but the scent s amazing Product smells amazing,Neutral
I wasnt really expecting much but this little bottle of perfume rocks!! It smells so good especially if you layer it with other things its a real pic me up!!Im planning on getting a bigger bottle thanks!! Wow...,Neutral
I have used a ton of different tanning lotions. Bronzing silicone tingling etc. I guess you could call me an experienced tanner. I used Queen because I had always wanted to try it and heard that it was really good. My skin never felt so soft with a tanning lotion! The royal bee jelly really does the trick! It gives you beautiful color too. Some may not like the smell but I thought it was a very pretty perfume smell. If you layer it on evenly and not too thick the smell won't be overbearing. If you apply just enough you'll be fine.My skin didn't look or feel greasy either! Softest skin you'll get with a tanning lotion!,Neutral
i like the color i got in one  minute bed session with tanning from this lotion but i can't get past the smell. it smells like an intoxicating perfume. i usually tan in the morning and run my errands so when ever i caught whiff of myself i wanted to go home and shower. probably won't use again smells perfumey,Neutral
When I was at my darkest.. (ppl said angel stop tanning!!!)  I needed to get my arms to catch up to the rest of me. im naturally pale as that guy from the movie powder.  so it works. lol  I couldn't get anything to get me darker i switched beds laid outside used oil and salt water and I didnt like black (my tan washed off with black)and yes i got skin cancer if you're wondering...so be smart and dont burn.  always use lotion!  i quit tanning after that for a year .. now just here and there for sun as i work third and suffer from seasonal.  Sooo.  I used Queen twice or more on my arms and shoulders... for a few sessions.  I seen a huge difference in my arms and the rest of my body that i used beautifully brown on.  My arms got darker and felt softer almost silky i guess...  And the smell was awesome.  I dont like vanilla scents or to smell like an apple pie or other foods.  So this was a nice perfume feminine type of scent.  I like it a lot.  Just dont want to dish out the money for it haha...  it is just lotion anyway right? sample tried x,Neutral
I really like this lotion. Im really big on smells and I dont like to smell like a fruit or chocolate or any food. This smells really good! like perfume! and its not too thick... it also did help me with burning...UPDATE!!! After about  weeks of using the products I was able to sun tan my sun spots... ok let me explain... sometimes people get confused on what sun spots are well the ones im talking about at least.... There not the ones that are like blotches on ppls faces there the ones that no matter what you do everything thing else will tan on your body but these spots will stay light. Well I thought I would always have them... on my upper stomach and my lower back... I even started wearing different bathing suits to hide them on my stomach... well they have completely went away I have even skin tone! I don't kno if this sounds normal but I used to be jealous of woman with even skin tone. But kno I put this on and go and tanning and I have an even skin tone!! FYI I used to tan indoors before and still would have white spots... Wonderful Smell!!,Neutral
I have been tanning for years but I am not loyal to any particular brand of tanning lotion.  Queen was recommended by one of the girls at my salon.  It does work (I have been complimented on my tan after only going once or twice a week for the past month but the smell is AWFUL.  It is SOOOO perfumey...and not a good perfume smell...more like an old lady White Diamonds kind of smell (R.I.P Liz).  I can barely wait two hours to shower this stuff off and my boyfriend hated the smell.  Soft skin and a decent tan (with some redness) is worth finishing this bottle but definitely not worth buying it again. Works but smells GROSS,Neutral
I purchased this lotion after debating over a few. I was reading some mixed reviews but I am glad that I went with this one. I've heard and seen good things about royal jelly. Honey and royal jelly are high up on the list of ingredients too. I feel a little better about putting that on my skin than silicone ingredients from nature are more appealing to me. This lotion goes on smooth smells nice has a fairly light scent I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but green apple pear and honey comes to mind ( I don't understand the reviews that say it smells terribly strong and perfumey ) and feels quite moisturizing. My boyfriend smelled me after I just came back from tanning and playfully commented on how yummy I smelled :) he said he really liked it. That's a positive about this lotion I'm not left stinky after tanning like often happens. It is a little bit thick feeling and I feel slightly sticky for a little while after tanning but that fades after about half an hour or so. I'm satisfied with it and the color I've gotten with it. Feel good about using this lotion,little bit
All the Designer Skin products are great! This one smells like a feminine perfume it leaves my skin silky smooth and skin color is nice after I tan. I've smelt like I was burnt a few times but it's better than smelling like I was burnt every time with a different product I used. My boyfriend uses Obsidian and he's a lot darker than me and we started at the same time. Obsidian also smells stronger he said it tingles his skin and it more masculine of a scent. I like the Luminary and maybe I'll try his next. Great Product,great product
This does not smell the greatest and then after applying it and tanning I smelled like I had old lady perfume on.  Thumbs Down,Neutral
I've been tanning irregularly for a couple years now I go now and then and at one point I had good color but then I stopped going often enough this tanning lotion gave me a great even boost in color after just  session and I assume after a few more sessions it'll have me dark in no time I'm quite satisfied as it does take me awhile to tan also it smells awesome from the descriptions that it was perfume-like concerned me its really not very fresh and clean smelling slightly citrusy Exactly what was promised,Neutral
I bought this at my salon since I have received fake lotions buying online before. First off yes it's expensive and if you are lucky enough to get the real thing on line then great. But I don't want to take the chance anymore. I used this twice so far and already am a few shades darker. It is a darker lotion but not too dark. Some others on here say that it is a light tan that would be incorrect. It does have more of a perfume scent which many like I'm not crazy about it but hey that's what body spray is for! Goes on silky smooth and after tanning is still smooth. This is the best lotion I've used thus far but I'm always trying new things. Oh it does leave your skin sparkly I for one am not crazy for the stripper look but the sparkles are okay Bought at salon,Neutral
This lotion costs $ at my salon. I was super curious and since they didn't have sample packets my only choice was to buy a full size bottle from Amazon. I'm sure glad I did. I finally found a lotion to help me break through my tanning plateau. I can always rely on Designer Skin to offer bronzers that don't cause streaks. I'm pretty sloppy when it comes to applying my lotion so non-streaking ones are a must. I had fabulous results after just one use and it made my skin feel silky smooth and moisturized for hours later. There was no ATO even on my hands which for some WEIRD reason always smell like burnt toast no matter what lotion I'm using. It has a perfume-y/cologne-y smell that's familiar to me but I can't remember exactly what it is. I would consider it a unisex scent. I think a man could easily get away with using this lotion without feeling self-concious about it. I normally prefer more fruity scents. However the smell doesn't linger for long so I don't have to worry about smelling like a man after tanning. It has quite a bit of glitter in it which some people may not like and I don't think Designer Skin emphasized that enough in their official description. They call the ingredient Soft Celestial Stardust but it's very noticeable. I personally think it's kinda sexy. The bottle is hilarious. I didn't realize that the stars actually lit up when I bought it. Worth the hype,Neutral
This perfume I had high hopes for but only to be let down.  It smells like chemicals and not good at all. :( I love perfume and I have tons of it but this is one of the worst ones. it doesn't stay on for longer than an hour.  I will not be buying this again. It smells like chemicals,Neutral
For this perfume to so inexpensive it stays with you all day and has a fresh fragrance. Although this isnt my favorite fragrance from Addidas. It still smells wonderful. The Fruity Rythm and also the fragrance in the lime green bottle are my favorites! I LOVE ADDIDAS PERFUME,Neutral
Lovelovelove this perfume. Smells so clean like I just got out of the shower! Such a good product for a very low price! Highly recommend! Love this!,Neutral
This has a nice flowery scent. However it is very strong and can be kind of overwhelming. It has has a strong alcohol smell when you first spray it on. As the scent wears off it becomes more bearable.This is ok and maybe a little better than average but I prefer smoother cleaner scents. I'm a huge fan of the Beckham line and I think there are better options from that line than this.If you like really strong scents I would get this. But if you're like me and like something more subtle I'd pass on this.I recommend the Beckham line of perfumes and colognes though even though I'm not a big fan of this one scent. They are reasonably priced at around $ for a . oz bottle. They are designer quality at a very cheap price. I currently have  different Beckham perfumes. Very strong flowery scent.,Neutral
I got this a couple years ago in small samples and I refused to use them until I went somewhere worth using them. I finally decided to buy the big bottle and am so happy it was cheap and smells so cheap. Always remember that perfume spoils so its best to put it in the fridge in the summer and store in a cool dry place in the winter! Always smells so fresh and lovely!,Neutral
I got a sample of this perfume at a beauty store & fell in love with it. It has such a wonderful smell mellow yet feminine. My absolute favorite now! luv it,Neutral
I'm picky about perfume and I love this scent. The bottle is cute. I haven't noticed it wearing away quickly. Great scent,Neutral
The comment another reviewer made re the non lasting aroma my experience is thus: My husband noticed that from the time I applied this perfume (early in the morning) and by the time I go to bed (pm) the potency of the perfume was still there...how's that for lasting aroma?  This scent is hard to describe but I get stopped often and asked what I'm wearing...I tell them.  BUT perhaps I should consider NOT recommending this perfume so much lest they run out of this hidden jewel since has become difficult for me to obtain. Smells Exquisite!!,Neutral
I been wanting this perfume ever since I tried the sample from Macy's. The scent is just amazing. It's not too fruity or too floral. It smells sophisticated and sensual at the same time. I was kind of skeptical on whether this perfume was going to be fake or not because the price is very affordable and I had seen this perfume on Target for $.But it does smell just like the sample from Macy's so I don't think is a fake.I Love it! Smells Amazing!,Neutral
I bought it for a relative who loves this perfume. The selling point for me was its price on Amazon. The item arrived quickly and well packaged. As far as the scent goes I can't comment on it because I am not familiar with it. Great Price,Neutral
my shelf if full of the most famous brands of perfumes so when I am giving you my opinion I am comparing it to many others that  I use.. This perfume is so feminine royal  really lovely and the best this about it that it lasts till the next day. I got many compliments from people about this one more than any other kind ! it actaully lasts I keep getting compliments,Neutral
While trying to find Amarige I cam across this scent and after wearing a sample for the evening fell in love with it. I ended up buying Amarige for evening and this one for day although works well for evening scent as well. Love it!! Ange au Demon Perfume,Neutral
Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of Citrus AT ALL.And I bought this perfume blindly because I love Fantasy and Midnight Fantasy. Also I really wanted that spicy orange cake that everybody talked about.At first all I got was a strong smell of citrus. I didn't like it at all.After using it again I got used to it and actually grew to like it..a lot. It started smelling like an Orange Panetone cake an Italian pastry. Very delicious. Go figure. This has been happening to me a lot frequently. I grow to love perfumes that I didn't like initially. LOVE IT!,Neutral
Will always buy my perfumes from amazon from now on. There like $ cheaper and you get the same product. I took a chance on this perfume because I had never smelt it before but boy it smells great. This is my going out perfume. Cheaper then Macy's,Neutral
When I see beach themed perfumes I expect them to smell of coconuts and ocean notes.  That makes this perfume a very pleasant surprise.  Beachy doesn't smell like suntan lotion or marine notes it's much softer and more complicated.  It's a very fresh scent one that's very easy to wear and one that has more staying power than I was expecting.  This is a delightful and unassuming perfume for daytime especially well-suited to spring and summer. Happy and fresh daytime scent,Neutral
this perfume smells great! Reminds me of sunshine and water. The bottle is beautiful too...too pretty to put away I keep it out in my bedroom to enjoy the sea glass color of it! summer in a bottle,Neutral
This is by far the best perfume I've ever smelled! It's clean it's simple and it's affordable. And to top it off the bottle is super adorable. The best  bucks I've ever spent!,Neutral
I don't live close to any stores that sell this so I took a gamble and ordered on Amazon based on all the positive reviews. I was hoping for a fragrance with floral/salt notes with just a hint of summer melon. When it arrived I smelled the bottle - it was truly lovely and complex with strong white floral notes and a hint of salt/sea spray and a little melon. Truly lovely like being in a garden on a humid summer morning. Not quite like the beach - more like a garden. However after about  minutes of applying to my skin the floral notes all turned powdery pungent and sickly sweet. It actually reminded me of a combination of baby powder and cheap drugstore perfume marketed for &#;mature women&#;. It is too bad because the scent in the bottle is amazing. Giving it  stars because it makes for a nice room freshener. Smells lovely and floral in bottle but powdery and sickly sweet on my skin,Neutral
This is my all time favorite Perfume I like sweet scents though so if you don't probably not a good choice for you. Perfect scent,favorite perfume
I love Viva La Juicy... and so does my fiance... The scent is heavenly... subtle... but lasting! I definitely still have perfume on at the end of the day!The bottle is adorable too and the spray nozzle works really well. I have sometimes struggled with the quality of perfume spray bottles but not with this one! The nozzle delivers just the right amount of perfume and in a concentrated enough spritz that your perfume is not wasted when it sprays on either side of your neck/wrists! LOVE this perfume,Neutral
About the buying experience and about the seller:I ordered this perfume from igetitdoneright a amazon marketplace seller and it came quickly. I was really excited to open it but got disappointed to see that the packaging was not good enough. I found that the lid of the bottle was sticky like someone tried to stick it with a glue and almost / of the perfume was gone. I called amazon and they wrote an email to the seller saying that I had received a defective item and would like to get a refund. Seller emailed me very casually saying that the bottle must got broken in transit and they will send me a full bottle after I return them this for free. I did not want to go in the hassle of sending it back on my own money and wasting both of ours time. So I went ahead and requested amazon for a full refund. Amazon was kind enough to refund me the amount. I will never buy any perfume from this seller again. The seller's approach to this situation was they do not give a s*** what customer says and very careless as far as packing goes. They should not send a glass bottle just packed in another same size usps box. The bottle will definitely brake or leak.About the fragrance:My st impression of this perfume is that its very strong. I do smell honeysuckle amber and jasmine as strong notes. It's very youngvibrant flirty and less goes a long way. I will definitely suggest it for a younger crowd or a person who wants to feel younger again. To me its too sweet and girly. Honest review!!!,long way
love the smell of this perfume but i dont think it lasts that long. i don't mind respraying though :) i get lots of compliments on this but i think ill try some different ones before i repurchase this one. deffinately way better than the original.... that one smells like old people to me. smells so lush and rich but doesn't last long,Neutral
I love sweet perfumes and this is one of my absolute favorites. It has a rich full bodied caramel scent with a hint of floral on me at first and finishes with a deep lingering smell that is really hard to define but is absolutely gorgeous. It lasts for hours on me with just a spritz and it also mixes well with a lot of different body lotions I use. The bottle is so cute and well made and looks perfect on my vanity with my other perfumes. I'm on my nd bottle in almost  years so it lasts a long time and it's a good price. You can sometimes find it on sale at Target and it's worth every penny. Such a great perfume!,long time
I love this perfume! It's a little pricy but definitely worth it. It will always be one of my favorite scents. Viva La Juicy,Neutral
I have been wearing this perfume for a few years and have always paid over $ for it.  Now I find it on here for a whole lot less!  I get stopped all the time by people asking me what I'm wearing.  Try this you wont be sorry. Can't get enough of this stuff!!,Neutral
Viva La Juicy is one of my favorite perfumes and to get this size for such a great price was awesome. Great Price,Neutral
Viva La Juicy is my absolute favorite in the Juicy Line of fragrances. Although It's sweetit's not sickeningly sweet;It doesn't overpower.I find that it has the right balance...not too soft and not too strong.If you're looking for a warm & feminine fragrance look no further. Also if you're a fan of fruity floral perfumesyou will not be disappointed. It just puts a smile of my face as well as other people.I get lots of compliments whenever I wear it.The smell of sweet fruits makes me feel so pretty. I adore this perfume. Mmmm Intoxicating :),Neutral
I got this for my birthday from my bf.  I'd never heard of it.  At first I laughed at the name as I thought it was a silly fragrance being sold just on a fun name.  It reminded me of what Rasputia in the movie Norbit would wear.  I figured my BF just bought something and didn't know anything about perfumes.Since I started wearing it.  I get complimented all the time!  Workers at Subway coworkers friends etc.  I'm constantly told you smell good.  Well that's the point right?  I've had all sorts of good perfumes by the biggest names over the years.  NONE of them have brought about the compliments I get with this fragrance.  I had an older retired guy recently tell me I smelled good. I told him what it was called cuz hey the name is fun!  He told me it should be called boner :O  So it's good for laughs too.I can't deny compliments so I'll be replacing this one when I'm out! Pleasantly surprised,Neutral
Well it's not a horrid in general but the drydown of sickly-sweet caramel is horrible on my skin. I love the fruity topnotes. The rest of the perfume... no thanks. Don't like the smell,Neutral
I love this perfume.  I received a sample some time back and I've been wanting to purchase it for quite a while.  The price on Amazon was unbeatable.  I dinged it one star because the staying power of this perfume is not very good. Smells Amazing,Neutral
This perfume smells great but within a short time of applying it you can no longer smell it. I have tried this scent from testers in various stores and it would last all day. I am so disappointed that this one doesn't seem to be as lasting. Smells wonderful but doesn't last very long,Neutral
I just received this perfume from Amazon and I am sooo in love with it. It is % authentic. I debated to buy it at a dept. store but when I saw it on Amazon for half the price it was no brainer. Smells sooo good and lasting on power is amazing. This and Jadore are my absolute favorite perfumes of all of times.Thank you Amazon so much for a wonderful product and such an amazing price. Love it so much! My ultimate fave!,Neutral
This is my all time favorite perfume and it has been for years. I have loved this perfume since I was fourteen and I am now eighteen. It has a very youthful smell to it and it's sweet but without being too overwhelming. I own two of the other Juicy perfumes the original one and Peace Love and Juicy. Viva is still my favorite. I put some on at Macy's a few days ago and the scent didn't wear off until the next day! I absolutely adore this fragrance I will never be without a bottle of it. Favorite perfume ever,favorite perfume
Go to everyday beautifully and sexy smelling perfume's!!!! I have one of every variation of the Juicy Couture's line of perfumes and a large variety of other perfumes as well and yet this is still one of my top every day go to's! The seller shipped it fast and very securely.  Thank you! One of my top favorite...,Neutral
I like this perfume but not enough to spend $ on a bottle like this so I browsed Amazon for options. I never bought perfume like this online because you never know if you'll get an original or a bad fake. I ordered Viva la Juicy that was sold by Amazon and it was just $ for . ounces I don't know if it really is original but even if it's a fake it's a very good one. The smell is right lasts well and there's no bad &#;aftertaste&#; fakes tend to have.I'm very happy with the purchase it's an excellent not overpowering sweet scent (I hate smelling like I bathe in perfume- gives me a headache). One pump lasts me pretty much all day.The bottle is rather cute with a nice bow and two little charms the top stays on well. I've seen a number of reviews saying that the top was coming off and something was wrong with the box and the bottle- I had no such issues everything packed well the box was in excellent condition like everything else. I believe those people purchased from other sellers though. Amazon did a great job yet again. Recommended! Great,Neutral
Before I say anything else I just want to make clear that this is a review of the scent itself and not my buying experience like many of the negative reviews on here are. Just how I feel about the scent.I'd wanted to see what all the hype over this fragrance was so on my trip to Macy's yesterday I sprayed this concoction on wrist. The sweetness immediately hit me and went as far as giving me a headache if I got my nose too close to my wrist even after the perfume dried down. Eventually the amber and other notes kicked in. I'm usually more into lighter scents with some citrus notes so when I read that this had a mandarin note in it I got my hopes up. Unfortunately I couldn't smell anything here but an overwhelming  sticky sweet mess. There is nothing 'crisp' or light about it. I don't see anything special about this perfume and have smelled many other similar scents with a much much lower price tag. Vanilla + amber? It's practically the clich&eacute;  of women's fragrance.The reason this perfume got an extra star though is because I sprayed it on at pm yesterday. It is now am the following day and I've scrubbed my wrists more than once to get rid of the  scent  and I can still smell it! Even I have to admit that that is quite impressive.So as with any fragrance - try it before you buy it. Heavy and Overly Sweet - Clich&eacute; in a Bottle,Neutral
I have worn this fragrance for over three years and it's by far my favorite. It's a light pleasant scent but it doesn't wear off quickly and I have gotten lots of compliments on it. I also love the fact that amazon has it so much cheaper than sephora! Lovely perfume,Neutral
This is the best smelling perfume I have ever smelt. I love it. It is the only one I wear besides Enchanted from Bath and Body Works and I will continue to wear it as long as they make it. I smell so good. It is amazing how many complaments I get on it. Favorite,Neutral
My mom brought me this perfume from the local mall for my birthday in November and I am in love! It's a very sweet scent that lasts a long time. A couple of sprays go a long way. I'll put it on in the morning and when I come home from my  hour work shifts it's still on my clothes. I get compliments literally all the time on how good I smell. This is a must have perfume though it is pricey. Love It!,long way
I've had this perfume for years and still have most of the bottle left! I simply adore Juicy Couture Fragrances especially Viva La Juicy! It's so fruity and floral! Juicy Couture's Viva La Juicy Viktor & Rolf's Flowerbomb Katy Perry's Killer Queen and Beyonce's Pulse are my signature fragrances! One of my favorites!,Neutral
I bought this perfume because I ran out of the smaller bottle I bought at Ross. I was surprised at the size because I expected something small but I am VERY happy! The scent is RIGHT on the bottle is super cute (and big LOL) and the scent lasts! I know some people are worried about this product being a knock off. In my opinion it's legit since: ) the smell is the same ) the bottle is like the smaller one I have with some differences (like any other fragrance) and ) the box is JUST like the box from my smaller bottle. I'm not tripping on the small things. This is a PERFUME that's meant to be smelled! I spray perfume like a mad woman so I don't have any issues with wear length. Honestly I do this with ANY perfume (I like to leave my scent behind LOL).I HIGHLY recommend! GREAT BUY! This product is legit (IMO),Neutral
I love this perfume and the price. I wear this perfume every day and spray more on when I am going out. I just absolutely love this perfume. Love IT!!,Neutral
This is truly a .! I absolutely love this perfume very sweet with a fruity/floral tone but not too strong or overpowering. To me this smells a bit like Justin Bieber's Someday perfume which is another one of my favorites (no shame!). I took off . stars because it doesn't last as long as I would like but if I use an unscented lotion before I spray that helps a lot! I highly recommend this perfume to any age woman who likes sweet perfumes that aren't too florally. One of my favorites!,Neutral
This perfume reminds me a lot to &#;Laguna Maravilla&#; by Paco Rabanne. It has a beautiful flowery / citric / mystic scent. I only wear perfume's that make me want to make love to myself. And this one makes me want to make love to myself. Highly recommended. A couple of my friends use it to and we always get compliments. Delicious,Neutral
I didn't notice the parfum.  Yeah real natural.  Smells feminine and chemical so I gave it to our admin at work.  She loved it but she also has no compunction about wearing tons of perfume and fake scents.  Perfect for her.  From now on if I want organic I'm going with Dr Bronners.  This fancy stuff always disappoints. Gave mine away,Neutral
excellent productreceived in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to give TO PURCHASE FOR YOU GO AHEAD ITS A NICE PERFUME RECOMMENDED ORIGINAL PERFUME RECOMMENDED,Neutral
VERY sexy spray....I bought this for my boyfriend cause hes really picky about what cologne he wears. Nailed it Wow he smells perfect cant stay away from him.....This is the perfect perfume for the guy you love! Wow.......best smelling man!,Neutral
My usual 'daily' perfume is no longer available. So I went on a hunt for a new one. I tried a bunch at the local store and narrowed it down to a few fragrances. This was one of them and thanks to my husband was one of my birthday presents.I like that it is light and not too sweet. It has some flower scent but not obvious. It smells nice and soft but it doesn't seem to last. Although admittedly you shouldn't be able to smell your own perfume after it's been on for awhile or you have too much on!I have not had any compliments yet on wearing it but I still like it. Nice Light Scent Doesn't Seem to Last Long Enough,Neutral
Its light not strong at all but it smell real good if you like strong perfume don't buy this because its not for u Wow smell good but its a light perfume,Neutral
This perfume sometimes gets bad reviews in that it's not a show stopping scent.  I don't think it was crafted to floor rooms because what it seems to be (and I'm wearing it right now) is politely and quietly pretty.  No it's not complex but I forgive it for that as it is charming in the same way that a daisy is charming.I love this perfume for the same reason that I love a perfect daisy!  But at the same time it is Elizabeth Arden at her most demure and charming.Why do perfumes have to all these deep and dimensional meanings anyway! ;) LOLIt's perfectly low-key and pretty. Very Pretty Floral,Neutral
I'm a long time user of Olay's Age Defying body wash product so I thought I'd give the Total Effects a try. Total Effects comes out of the container more like a cream than a lotion it's quite a bit stiffer in consistency than their other products. The only ingredient differences that I can see from the label are mineral oil and jojoba oil I assume the mineral oil (rd ingredient on the list) contributes to the texture. After washing with the product my skin does feel soft and moisturized but not noticeably more than it is with the product I had been using. Not enough more to justify the fact that you get eight more ounces of product for about a dollar less with the Age Defying compared to Total Effects.Also. If we are trying to make our skin look younger with this product WHY would we want to it's fragrance smell like an old lady? Because that's how the fragrance comes across to me. Quite powdery kind of camphorish with a tiny hint of an amber note. It smells very grandma's perfume to me. I much prefer the scents they've used in the Age Defying and in the Olay Quench body wash (and oh how I wish they would bring back the fragrance of the Scented to Calm body wash!!!!). I'm the sort of person that won't use a product if I don't really like the fragrance even if it was miraculous so I'll be sticking with my old product both for price and fragrance. works well enough nothing magical though,long time
I was excited to get this. However I wasn't able to use it enough to really give a good opinion on its effectiveness.  It has such a strong perfume counter smell. I used it for several days and did not grow any fonder of the scent. It does lather and foam really well and feels  very smooth on a poof. It rinses off really well and leaves skin feeling smoother but I just couldn't get past the smell.----Edited:So I ended up using the rest of this body wash when I ran out of my usual. Since it had been over a year I'm thinking that helped lessen the perfume smell which bothered me so much before.I still wished it had a lighter scent however it didn't seem to linger with me too much beyond the shower.It did help with wrinkle removal but not in a way I think I was expecting. I'm still pretty young in terms of wrinkles.I never actually used this on my face but I think that some of the product ended up on my wash cloth just by being in the shower and because of that I did wash my face with a very residual amount. I noticed that my one smile line went away as well as the one line in my forehead.So it did as promised. :) Way too heavily perfumed,Neutral
This product markets itself as an anti-aging body wash however what it really is is a moisturizing body wash (Someone in the Marketing Department must have come up with the idea that moisturizing your skin improves your skin's elasticity and thereby is somehow anti-aging).If you don't have any expectations of suddenly looking younger because you're using this product it does work well as a moisturizing body wash. With the second and third ingredients petroleum and mineral oil it does leave your skin feeling very smooth - you can feel that as you're washing your skin.Can you use this body wash and not moisturize afterwards? If you don't as a rule moisturize after you shower and want something that will leave your skin feeling smooth than this product will work for you. However it's winter in New England here and even with a moisturizing body wash I still feel the need for more lotion on my skin.As far as its scent personally I thought that the scent was very strong. If you're sensitive to perfumes or don't want to smell like your body wash you will probably want to pass on this body wash. Leaves your skin smooth but has a strong scent,Neutral
I like this product very much. It lather's nicely and does have a soothing and moisturizing affect. My skin is improving after only a short time and I intend on continuing to use this product. It's not too oily and it's not too perfume smelling. lathers nice,Neutral
This is a really unique body wash.  Unlike most products of this type it is very creamy.  When you dispense it a layer of cream is delivered to your hand or body.  It is not at all watery like some body washes.  The scent is subtle and does not clash with any perfume I decide to use. I really like this product,Neutral
Bought this for the wife she loves it! I'm not a fan of perfumes this one is actually not bad I would recommend and buy it again. Shipping took longer than what I have been accustomed to from Amazon. Amazon does state it will take - days to ship. Wife Approved!,Neutral
You can never go wrong with Dolce & Gabbana.  This particular scent is one of my absolute favorites!  Make sure to store all your perfumes in a dark place such as a drawer or medicine cabinet.  This makes a huge difference in the life of any perfume. My favorite perfume!,favorite perfume
A personal favorite in my collection since its debut in  I use this perfume more than any other. It has a nice light crisp scent. I love using it more in the Spring and Summer because of its kiwi and watermelon top notes and base notes of musk and pink cyclamen. It comes across as a moderate citrusy / fruity scent. The musk is absolutely untraceable as I do not like anything with a musky smell. I normally get a solid  hours of wear out of it. As long as this is in production it will be in my rotation. Perfect Scent for Spring and Summer,Neutral
This perfume smells so good! I sprayed it at the store walked out then had to go back and purchase it because it smells so good! Smells sweet with like a citrus/peachy note.This is for an older woman or a sophisticated young lady. Definitely wouldn't recommend it for ladies under  there are many other fragrances for younger ladies (like D&G; light blue Coach Juicy etc) this is not one of them. (If you're planning to give this as a gift) Sweet scent,Neutral
I received my product on time or earlier! I was very excited! The seller was very prompt! I look forward to using the product. I am extremely excited when I get the chance to use this it is a very soft sweet and subtle smell!! I'm excited to wear this product! This is my number one perfume!!Thank you!! I LOVE this one!,Neutral
...because everyone will be asking you what perfume you have on.  It's such a nice fresh clean scent.  Buy it.  You won't regret it. Remember the name...,Neutral
At first I wasn't going to try this scent out. I had just seen Twilight (the film) a week prior to my first mall visit when this was released and suddenly I see a perfume called Twilight Woods. Really? my mind said. Cashing in on the word twilight so it catches the eye of every  year old mall dweller that passes BBW? However there was a lovely scent coming from the store; I was drawn in and asked the saleswoman what the fragrance in the oil burner was.This is our new scent Twilight Woods she told me.I bought a bottle of body mist without even spraying it on my skin.It's the perfect sexy-woodsy scent. Definitely lots of different types of earthy notes balanced out by the soft florals. I would even classify it as unisex. On me this fragrance goes on and stays on. It doesn't fade until I wash it off. It's become my default fragrance; when I don't know what to wear I spritz this on and I never regret it. An unexpected love.,Neutral
This fragrance is so soft and sensual...not too bold but yet very alluring. I have had many people ask me what it is I have on...and when I tell them Twilight Woods from Bath and Body Works they seem surprised. It is a fairly inexpensive perfume compared to department store fragrances. It seems to be a bit bolder when it is layered with the other products such as the body wash and body lotion. It is a very popular item at Bath and Body Works because they are always out of it...they had been out of it everywhere for months. I found it through Amazon...that is why I love shopping through Amazon. I can always find what I am looking for especially if whatever it is I am looking for is out of the stores...I can almost guarantee Amazon will have it. ;-) A lovely soft sensual scent,Neutral
This is a lovely new fragrance out by Bath and Body Works. It is perfect for a romantic day/night out with your man. I think this one smells best as the perfume because after wearing the lotion for a while it seemed to me that the scent turned into a more flowery scent that reminded me of the body shops Neroli Jasmine scent. However that wasnt a bad thing im just really into sensual darker scents.A lot of people are buying this one so it seems to be quite the hit for Bath and Body works.My favorite by Bath and Body works is still the Sensual Amber though. And the Japanese Cherry Blossum. So if your looking for other romantic scents I highly suggest those. :) A beautiful romantic walk in the woods.,Neutral
I don't think of gentle facial soaps as being so fragrant. Even when it's essential oils too much of a good thing can still cause a bad reaction for people with sensitive skin. Luckily I haven't reacted to this soap but the strong aroma scared me enough to hold off trying it till after Christmas. It smells nice but fragrant things and my face usually don't get along well. I ordered this expecting that it might have a *mild* scent from natural oils not that it would be just as strong as all their other soaps.Other than my initial shock the soap is fine so far. Nothing to rant or rave about yet but I'll update this review after I've used it for awhile. At this point it doesn't seem any different from the regular zum bar soaps for your body... other than it's more drying than I expected. I have combination skin but of course it's drier in the winter. If you're not familar with Zum bar soaps they're lovely. They do a great job of leaving me clean and soft without drying out my skin or breaking me out. So I was expecting zum face to leave me a little more hydrated than it does. But... it hasn't completely dried me out or cause flaking or anything so far. Beware it's perfume-y,sensitive skin
I have nothing bad to say about this product. It works great has no icky perfumey smell and is all natural. The price is pretty reasonable and this stuff makes my skin look great. It also does a great job of removing all traces of makeup by using just a small amount of the product. I'd go so far as to say that this is the best cleanser I've ever used. I definitely recommend it. Great everyday cleanser,Neutral
I love organic root stimulator there products are the best. Whenever I see something new from them I make sure to buy it. I bought this today because I always need something to control my edges. This works great and it does not make my hair hard. My hair feels nice and soft after use and it smells so nice. I opened the jar and I could not stop smelling the gel it smells like perfume. Try it it is a great product. great product,great product
I wasn't expecting such a tiny bottle but after using it for some clients and myself at a recent wedding I understood the value of what I had in my hand. Wouldn't send it back for all the money in the world and smell really put it in the +++ category. With sensitivities to heavy perfumes aerosol polycarbonates in the air (for you asthmatics) this is really mild but does what it says and without sticky heavy or gluey residues. Designer Hair Spray that you can Count On This Time,Neutral
Like many people when the economy hit the skids I downgraded my salon caliber hair products to something available at the Club store. I didn't notice much difference frankly.These products have a really fresh and clean scent without being perfumey.  And my hair definitely feels better.So it feels better and it smells better ... does it look better?  I think it does.  I feel like the cream help calm some of my fly-aways.I really like it and time will tell if in the long run I feel it's worth the extra money.Incidentally the shampoo and conditioner are both too large to meet airline regulations for carry-on so if you are thinking this set would be perfect for travel think again. weeks later:It's love!  My new shampoo and I are a match made in heaven.  My hair looks so much healthier than it has in years.  I will definitely by purchasing more Fekkai products. It could be love,Neutral
The Fekkai Glossing Starter kit includes shampoo conditioner and styling cream.  All the products had a great pear/apple scent that I decided to use them the same day I received them.  I already have healthy hair but I noticed more shine on my hair not only while wet but also when I dried it.  You really only have to use a little bit of the styling cream but since I have coarser fuller hair I added a just a dab more of cream than the pea-sized recommendation by Fekkai.  The best feature about the set is that my hair smelled really good the fragrance is not overpowering and ends up smelling clean and like crisp green apples for my body chemistry.  Co-workers and friends commented that my new perfume smelled great and I told them it's my hair products.  You have to get close to notice the scent too which is great.  I do not recommend wearing perfume though I think it would clash or present problems of depending on your perfume and body chemistry. Have Glossy Shiny Great smelling hair.,little bit
If you love fancy this is a great set. The body gel lathers well with a sponge or poof but not with a regular wash cloth. The scent is a perfect match to the perfume so it works well to layer. The lotion is slightly less impressive having a bit of a plastic smell to it that turns me off. Otherwise its a great set & the price CANNOT be beat. It retails for fifty nine at department stores so twenty five is a steal! Stinky lotion & all. Great set Great price!,Neutral
First of all I think this smells so great! It's kind of like expensive perfume but not to worry the scent is not strong once it is absorbed onto the skin. It also does a right job of moisturizing my dry flaky skin. The consistency is quite light and just a tad bit watery which is good it make sit easier to spread on the skin. I took off once star because it is tacky. It's not greasy but it's tacky in a way that it sticks to fabrics and can be uncomfortable. Good,Neutral
I love this stuff the only thing is that it has a really perfumey smell.  It's not gonna keep your eyeshadow completely the same all day it fades the color just a little throughout the day but it does the job it works good. Yay,Neutral
When I ordered this item I was worried about the excessive perfume odor that some reviewers mentioned. When I recieved the item I was pleased to find that the odor was not over powering but rather faint. It is more of a subtle odor. I am a fan of foam hand soap as it does not build up in the sink. This soap also does not dry out your hands if you was your hands too much. Excellent Hand Soap,Neutral
I'm still young enough that I definitely have no need to run out to the store for StriVectin but at the same time I cycle long distances and the sun and wind take their toll. Genetically I have dark under eye circles coupled with very thin skin there that drives me up a wall. I use MAC eye cream which contains caffeine. However the price tab for that teeny tiny tube is hard to swallow. So this at first glance seems like a great alternative.Pros:) Sun block - granted it's only SPF ) Softens skin) Eye cream works comparably well to my MAC cream) Price) I like the holder - it's unobtrusive but neatCons:) I broke out! I never get pimples EVER - however three weeks in and my skin was blotchy and I had pimples on my forehead and cheeks. I stopped for two days and my normal color returned resumed...the blotching returned too. So I had to stop using the face cream for this reason (eye cream okay so it is definitely the face activating cream)) It smells like perfume - I'm pretty scent sensitive I hate it) The whole apply one first then apply an activating cream gets old) You have to use very little or the grey cream seems to pill up under make-up) Instructions are shoddy - can I use it with primer?I do think it has worked remarkably well for tightening the skin under my eyes and reducing the appearance of dark circles. However I don't think it did anything on my face (before the blotching); it may not have been long enough. I do not think it sat under my make-up well either. It just didn't absorb well. I was using Ole Henriksen truth serum and Ulta primer which felt light and sat well under make-up. I feel like this is heavy no matter how thing I try and spread it and makes my make-up gummy and less attractive. Granted to be fair I have very light skin with some freckling.I did actually buy a new tube of the eye cream (Neutrogena has a rebate too through //). I plan on using it daily and saving the MAC cream for the weekends/special occasions.Bottom line: . stars for the eye cream  stars for the face cream Approx -. stars for having the two-step process. Some tightening and reduction of under eye circles with the eye cream. No improvement or tightening noted with the face cream - actually seemed to make forehead worry lines and laugh lines worse under make-up. Developed a sensitivity to the face cream (possibly due to the perfume?). I recommend the eye cream and for that reason the starter set might be a good initial purchase to see how it works for you. Smells loud but does soften skin,Neutral
Aveeno Ageless Vitality seems to be marketed as a miracle cream that not only keeps your skin resilient and younger-looking it will reduce the appearance of wrinkles or diminish the look of age spots.  Aveeno also claims that % of women showed improved skin vitality in  weeks.If only this product really did all it claims to do.  Perhaps it microscopically reduced my wrinkles - all I know is that when I look in a mirror I see no difference at all in the  weeks that I have faithfully been putting the Biomineral Concentrate and Rejuvenating Day Moisturizer on my face.In fact the Day Moisturizer is not only heavily perfumed (to cover the sunscreen smell - see below) if used as shown on the illustration in Step  (around the eye & on the eyelid) the day moisturizer will irritate your eyes.The Biomineral Concentrate ingredients are: Cyclopentasiloxane Dimethicone Trislloxane Silica Zinc Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Crosspolymer Tycopheryl Acetate Copper Powder.  The package includes  tubes of . (. ml) each.The Day Moisturizer consists of Avobenzone (%) Homosalate (%) Octisalate (%) Octocrylene (.%) and Oxybenzone (%) - all with the stated Purpose as Sunscreen.  The product also has a large amount of inactive ingredients in addition to the sunscreen (dill and blackberry are towards the end of the inactive ingredient list). There is one . fl.oz container of Day Moisturizer.With no noticeable difference in my skin and no noticeable difference in my existing wrinkles I'm going back to the original skin protection that I have used successfully for years - lotion mixed with a high SPF sunscreen. star because of the claim that % of women showed improved skin vitality when in fact the product does not live up to its claims. No Results Other Than Eye Irritation. Strong Perfume Smell also an Irritant.,Neutral
After I smelled in a local perfume shop I had to come and get it. So I ordered it as a gift for my Father for Christmas. Im  and even I wanted it for my self It kind smells fresh and clean with a tiny hint of musky not too too much Ideal for Night outings. Age range Id say from -....Totally reccomend! Was for my Dad,Neutral
This is the only soap one member of my family uses. It is gentle on the skin and isn't dry.Mild smell that is all its own not flowery or perfume like but I do like to buy the other scented kinds too. Household favorite,Neutral
First of all -year olds do NOT need to use an anti-aging moisturizer.  Just sayin'.  Secondly what do you wash your face with before applying that would cause it to burn?  Drano?  Lye?  Miracle Worker like all Philosophy products was created in a lab by doctors treating patients of plastic surgery recovery.  The beauty of their products is that they are not only gentle and free of perfumes and other such nonsense they actually improve the quality of your skin--providing you are using the proper product.  If one has sensetive skin Hope in a Jar can be slightly irritating which is why you should use When Hope is Not Enough.  Personally my skin loves HIAJ and I follow with Miracle Worker.  When they say you only need a tiny bit that's all you need; less than a half a teaspoon for the entire face and neck.  It firms evens skin tone and leaves the skin happy moisturized and soft.  I put it on at night and in the morning I don't even need to wash my face.  I put on a little mineral powder and blush a little eye makeup and my skin looks perfectly natural.  I get compliments on it all the time.  Philosophy products are amazing. What about this product could possibly burn??,Neutral
The formula seems pretty garden variety perfectly acceptable remover.  It does have a marginally better scent than some removers but it is still a cloying chemical smell covered by some sort of powerful perfume which will give you a headache if you don't wash your hands all the same.  But it is a good remover and I like these sponge removers.The only objection I have with this and the reason I will not be buying it again is because the cap leaks even if you screw it on very tightly every time.  Obviously you want to be careful with any remover but you do want to be able to have faith in the cap.  For me this is the sort of thing that ends up laying around my night stand over night and if it gets somehow knocked over by cats children or clumsiness it will leak and it will damage pretty much anything it happens to leak on.  If you are like me and like to keep this thing laying about then this can end in disaster.  I would also imagine that having a leaky lid would contribute to evaporation.  I do feel like I had to refill it quickly but I'm not sure if I noticed that because I expected to or not.It isn't just the one I ordered either it is something I have observed over the course of  jars of it until the nd jar caused permanent damage to my floor and I decided I would not get any more.  I suppose if you have a very secure place to keep it then you will have very little risk.  However it only takes one slip up to cause disaster.However there is nothing wrong with the formula itself. It is leaky,Neutral
I like the ease of application and the natural look that is produced by this product.  No high perfumes and any blemishes are covered quite nicely. Natural looking,Neutral
I had ordered this face cream along with the hand cream and the smell made me sick. It gave me a terrible headache and my sinus's swelled and I couldn't breathe. I had to return them.WARNING TO ALLERGY SUFFERS AND THOSE WITH SINUS ISSUES **********************The smell is so strong. Buyer beware!!! HORRIBLE PERFUME SMELL,Neutral
this is great for people who style their hair a lot. i straighten or curl my hair almost every day and it was getting pretty dry. this spray is perfect for re-hydration and makes my hair feel super soft and smooth. it does have kind of an intense perfumey/chemical smell though. soft hair - smells funny,Neutral
I was looking for a every day lotion after showers and read previous reviews so I decided to try this product.  I like it very much and as I mentioned before I use it every day and one bottle lasts me about  months so it is worth the money.  I love how my skin feels soft all dayit took about  weeks of daily use to get the results the bottle promises but my skin is very healthy now.  I absolutely recommend this product because it does not burn damaged skin and has a light fragrance so I can wear my perfume and the  scents do not clash together. Good daily regiment lotion.,Neutral
I wasn't sure when I bought this if it would fit everything but it did! I fits my make-up perfume deodorant toothbrush and paste and even my hair wash. I love the see-through pockets and that you can sneak tampons in the non-see through case if you want them hidden. This was my smartest purchase in a while. I would recommend! Fits ALL My Make-Up!,Neutral
My elbows and the back of my arms are baby soft.  I only need lotion for my hands and feet now.  I also have sensitive skin that itches with most soaps or laundry detergent.  This does not cause itching.  It also does not make my acne prone skin breakout.I was experiencing dry scaling on my legs and my heels were cracked.  I thought dry elbows and arms were just part of life.  Applying lotion after a shower is honestly just too much effort for me.  I'm also sensitive to most perfumed products.  I didn't expect this to work and it's expensive but I liked the smell so much I decided to give it a whirl.  After a week or two I was very surprised!I can also tell there is some oil in it because a residue builds up on my scrubbie if I don't rinse it extremely well. I don't mind it though.Update: I've been using mild soap instead for a few weeks.  Horrible!  My dry skin bumps are back and my skin looks crinkly and old.  Also I get lots of shave bumps when I don't use this.  I am going to try this on my face even though it sounds crazy.  I am desperate for a solution to my dry skin.  Will report back. Surprisingingly good,dry skin
I have sensitive dry acne prone skin.  I first tried this BB Cream last summer and immediately disliked it.  The color was way off and it felt too heavy.  I gave it another shot this winter and now I am loving it.  The color isn't perfect but it's not as bad as I originally thought.  It mixes well with my regular foundation to get a better color for me.  I apply it with a foundation brush which I hadn't before and this seems to blend it better and make it feel less heavy.  It has a strong perfumey scent which is why I gave it  stars (that and the color).  The coverage is pretty good.  I have used up to  pumps on days when I'm trying to get full coverage and  pump on days where I just want a medium coverage.  I find that even though it is a bit thick it blends easily and has a nice looking finish.  I would say it's more on the matte side but not super matte.  I haven't had any problems with it breaking me out or anything so that's a real plus.  It lasts all day and doesn't sink into my wrinkles unless I really pack it on.  Nothing a little Q-tip action can't handle.  Overall I am really happy with this BB Cream and will continue to use it.We will see if the summer weather makes me change my mind again ;) Really happy with this product,Neutral
I love this spray! This conditioner has a really nice scent not heavy or perfumey at all (not to me).  My hair is definitely on the drier side so I like having a conditioning spray to use since I wash my hair every other day.  I wear a uniform to work so once I put my hair into a ponytail or braid I'll spritz this on before I walk out the door.  My hair still smells good at the end of the day. Smells so good!,Neutral
This does smell more like vanila than coconut but it is still a great smelling perfume. It seems to linger on you for awhile. I get lots of compliments on it. Good Perfume,Neutral
I bought a . oz of Daisy Perfume by Marc Jacobs (On Amazon) for a great deal. Almost as much as the .oz but as I was getting ready for a  week trip I realized I could not take my perfume. I checked out the price for the .oz and refused to pay the same (expensive) price just so I could take my perfume. I went to Dillard's to find something and they told me to try a Atomizer. So I came to Amazon of course to look for one. It eventually to me to this little awesome thing! I didn't know how to use it and nearly broke it trying to figure it out but I got it and now I LOVE IT!!!!DON'T TAKE ANYTHING OFF OF THE TRAVALO ATOMIZER!. Just take the bottle out of the package. Do not remove the cap or lid or ANYTHING!. Get YOUR perfume remove JUST the cap... (the part that sprays)your perfume bottle will now just be showing the plastic part that sucks out your perfume. DO NOT LOSE YOUR CAP TO YOUR PERFUME.. Just take the Atomizer and look at the bottom. You will see a little hole. Align that hole with the plastic thing and start pumping your perfume into the atomizer. It is super easy and the perfume does not leak.I bought two of these little things and have had no problems. (so far) I wish I would have thought of this.I will be buying these for Christmas stocking stuffers. Genius Invention,Neutral
I am such a fan of travalo's. They have saved me many times from breaking a whole perfume bottle in my purse or suitcase. They are great for touch-ups when you feel that your perfume has worn off throughout the day. Love them!,Neutral
I have  bottles of old spray perfume that are clogged. I went online and searched the web on how to get it unclog but nothing worked. My last effort before I found this was to destroy the bottles and save whatever that's left and put it in those mini freebie perfume sample bottles. This thing totally saved me from doing all of that! Now I can transfer my old fragrance to this atomizer. It hasn't leak yet so I'm super happy with my purchase. Will buy another one for the other fragrance.It is also very light so you will save a lot of weight and room by not carrying a glass perfume bottle when you travel.// Update: I filled the whole atomizer with my favorite perfume and use it twice. Weeks later it's completely empty. I don't think it leaked (my purse didn't have any stain) but the alcohol/perfume just evaporate.. poof! gone!  Stars. Still love it but won't fill much at a time. OMG love this!,favorite perfume
If you don't like white florals in your perfumes you can give KIM KARDASHIAN a miss; It is basically a floral jumble and the only individual notes that stand out are the gardenia and tuberose and that is it. The florals are so powerful that they instantly slap me in the face and hide almost everything else.The fragrance is one dimensional and boring with very little difference between the top heart and base; There was a short lived burst of lemon in the opening then the jumble becomes heavier and sweeter and then the musk used in the base develops and joins in the mess [I'm not a fan of musk so I could do without it].I assume they were going for old Hollywood glamour with the big white floral notes but they went way too far with them - I personally can't see anything glamorous sexy or feminine about this fragrance it seems screamingly in-your-face loud so - dare I say it? - it comes off as rather cheap and tacky.Scent notes: Mandarin lemon honeysuckle orange blossom jasmine tuberose gardenia spices Tonka jacaranda wood vanilla orchid musk and creamy sandalwood.***This is the first perfume I've tried in a while that I've wanted to wash off. Unfortunately the staying power is good as the floral jumble is headache-inducing strong. My bottle was a gift so I felt duty bound to wear it and I ended up with a migraine almost every time I dared put it on.I'm not trying to be bitchy but I ended up giving my bottle away as it literally makes me ill to smell it now - even on other people.[No; I don't have anything against Kim Kardashian herself. If you just don't like this fragrance why are you instantly labelled as a bitchy jealous 'hater' or perfume snob?] Headache in a bottle...,Neutral
This is a very strong floral scented perfume. It smells mainly of gardenia. Wears well but can be too strong so spray less. decent perfume,Neutral
I don't like the smell of this perfume. I bought it without testing the smell I the store first. The perfume was so inexpensive that I thought to try it out... Smells nasty and cheap... Nope,Neutral
This is hands-down one of the most atrocious perfumes I have ever had the displeasure to smell. Regardless of how I feel about Kim Kardashian this stuff just smells god-awful. For the record I am not a Kim K. hater and I'm not out to get her or whatever. I just think that her perfume smells really really bad. I don't really know what hand she personally had in making this but whoever did make it obviously tried to make something that smells high end and it just fails miserably. Many of the notes in this particular fragrance are ones that I like (especially sandalwood jasmine and the ambiguous crisp top notes) but somehow the balance is just totally off. This perfume manages to smell nasty and cheap at the same time which I would assume is the exact opposite of it's intent. I'm not a big fan of celeb-created scents but this one really takes the cake as far as it's awfulness goes. I see that this has been popular enough to earn a flanker but I will get poked in the eye with a rusty butter knife before I smell that. There are plenty of better options for a warm sultry sensual scent so try those instead. You might pay a little more but at least you won't smell gross. Please don't buy this,Neutral
i would also give this  stars... i have spent alot of money on very expensive face creams.. I have T zone oil.. and this doesnt NOT make me an oil slick at  pm.. No perfume smell..obsorbs fast.. and drys fast.. LOVE this.. i use it as a DAY cream,Neutral
I bought these because I have dry sensitive skin and the ingredients seemed great. In my experience aloe vera chamomile and lavender are very good for my skin. However if you have a sensitive nose to go with your sensitive skin stay very far away from these. The smell is strong and chemically. It sure doesn't smell like any of the ingredients listed (the other remaining ingredients of note are patchouli and vanilla) it smells more like walking past a perfume counter in the mall or opening up a pack of baby wipes. And since fragrance isn't a listed ingredient on my pack I'm a bit worried at what other ingredients are unlisted.In terms of results these left my skin feeling a tiny bit dried out nothing like most face washes but not as good as other dry/sensitive skin wipes I've tried. Combined with the strong smell I won't be using these again. Okay wipe overpowering smell,sensitive skin
Paris is probably my least favorite celebrity out there but she makes good perfumes. Siren is my nd favorite after the original. It has a very strong note of honeysuckle in it as well as apricot. Definitely do get a vanilla note as well. This is a go to fragrance in the spring/summer for me because it just smells happy. It puts me in a good mood wherever I have it on and just is a very sunshine type of a scent. I don't find it to be strong at all it's a very light non offensive scent which I get complimented on a lot. My only gripe with it is the last power this doesn't last longer than - hrs on my skin. Great,Neutral
Great perfume light smelling ...Don't expect to lure sailors to their demise with this Siren. With that being said I DO get many compliments from this scent one in particular stood out from the others. I was applying for a credit card one day (in person at the bank) and you know how that goes. They call your name you go to a room or cubicle blah blah etc. That specific bank it was a room that you went into. I was sitting down he started asking questions ... (What kind of card do you want to apply for today?) blah blah etc. Then when everything was processing he asked &#;what kind of perfume do you have on?&#; &#;It fills up the room it smells so good (emphasis on so good). I'm saying thank you not giving him the answer to what kind of perfume it is. He goes on to say &#;I bet it's something expensive and you didn't even have to put a lot on.&#; &#;It smells like you just need a dab&#;. His wife's birthday was coming up and he said it smelled like a great gift. I played it off like I was one of those people that didn't want you to know what I was wearing because I don't like to smell like everybody else etc. Nevertheless my main point is ... Expensive? Hell no. Just a dab definitely not. You don't have to spray excessively but this is Paris HIlton's perfume. It does not last very long but the smell is wonderful. In spite of Greek mythology and all ...,Neutral
Yuck.  Her Fairy Dust is nice but this one is a true &#;stinker&#;  I don't know if I got old merchandise or what but I ended up giving this to my niece to put on her dog. Pari but I s Hilton Siren Perfume,Neutral
Sensual with a little heat and sweetness to it but not at all cloying. Go ahead and spend the money on this. Bargain Perfume,Neutral
this is my fifth fragrance from PH and I think it is my favorite.. long lasting fresh sexy...value for money my favourite PH perfume,Neutral
I have tries three of the Paris Hilton perfumes. I should stop now I think. They have such great reviews and I thought one or the other must be good. Unfortunately didn't work for me :( Siren is okay but I think I won't use it. The bottle and packaging is nice though but the perfume smells unlike what any siren would. It's better than Fairy Dust but nothing distinctive to remember. Nice Bottle!,Neutral
My absolute favorite perfume! Came packaged very carefully in tact and it was cheaper than in the department stores! I love it :) My favorite perfume :),favorite perfume
This perfume smells so real remind me of real roses once i had in my garden. Definitely for someone looking for a natural scent. Smell like a real Rose in Garden,Neutral
This scent is very easy on the nose and is very feminine. I tried this product on in an airport before I went looking for it online. It's very faint but lasts all day. If you like perfume but are sensitive to smells this one is for you. Remember the eau de parfum spray is the one you want for longevity. Amazing smell.,Neutral
First I didn't buy this perfume here yet. I first smell this at a local mall as I was looking for a Bday gift. This version is better than the first one. I'll probably purchase one here coz it's cheaper. I just hope it's not fake because of the reviews of people that they do not last that long. Because all colognes/perfumes that are new and ORIGINAL are suppose to stay longer on you no matter what the brand is. Dolce & Gabbana Rose The One,Neutral
I always use perfume with rose tone. This one is also a great buy really chic sophisticated yet not too bold.I get many compliments when wear this this is the one. D&G Rose The One,Neutral
Love this soap.  I bought this from a provider on Amazon...and found it to be dryer than the last soap I bought.However fast delivery and it comes right to my door..is the factor that interests me most.I am totally disabled from my disintegrating spine [from a car wreck].So any purchases I make have to be convenient for me and at least comparable in price & quality.The package came quickly was well-wrapped and the delivery man left it right at my door [in the apt building].Hooray for Amazon!My skin is a mess from medications I am required to take for pain and neuropathy.  This soap is a miracle..no m ore dry patches and all those other skin problems we  Pain Patients seem to get.  AND here's the biggie::: No chemicals..right from the Earth...no perfume and nothing to cause allergic reactions.PS::I only wish this soap was as moist as the batch I bought from an Independent seller online. skin problems go away fast!,Neutral
I have been shopping around for hair products for my curly hair because the products I used to use simply no longer cut it and my curls were starting to unravel and frizz. I tried Curl Junkie based on the reviews and have been using the products for about a month now. I have noticed that my curls are going back to their happy healthy selves again. Out of all the products I've tried this is my favorite. It does what it claims. Up until trying this I had never found a product that went in dry hair and made it look fresh and well groomed. This does. Every time. The only reason it get  stars is because of the scent. I am not a fan of fragrances being added to products. It isn't a bad fragrance - smells like a tropical drink - however I'd prefer either no fragrance or scenting it more naturally with essential oils rather than perfumes. But all in all this is a great product. Love this product,great product
I love the size of that lotion and how it simply disappears in the skin leaving it soft. Good moisturizer and the pump works great when you need only a tiny bit. However I'm not too crazy about the scent. It's fruity (which I generally like) but instead of smelling just fresh it's kind of heavy. Well I am quite sensitive to the aromas since I never wear perfumes and am therefore able to notice subtle details of the scent. Not crazy about the scent,Neutral
I love the Hempz body lotions. I use them daily year-round and they work great. Their lotions are so non-greasy that I can even use them on the hottest and most humid days of summer. It works great in the winter too. This lotion provides excellent moisturization without a heavy feeling. It soaks into your skin really quickly so you never feel sticky.I have used the Original Hempz body lotion mostly but recently I decided to try the Pomegranate scent because my hairstylist had a really good deal on it. I love the scent; it's not overpowering at all. In fact the scent is so light that I'm still able to wear my perfume without the scent of this lotion getting in the way of my perfume's scent. I wear perfume every day and it's nice to not have to compromise by skipping one or the other. I'm not sure if the lotion's scent fades quickly on everyone else but that works out well for me since I like using perfume.The price may seem a bit expensive for lotion to some people but I feel like it's definitely worth the price. Cheap department store body lotions simply do not compare to Hempz. I've never found such a great level of moisturization in any other body lotion. If you're looking for a good body lotion this is definitely one you should check out. Excellent Lotion,Neutral
I have received this sun product in a sun kit I got online. Even though it's not a shocker since it is Shiseido I still don't like the fact the product smells too perfume-y.  Living in Texas and having to deal with the hot heat in the summer I  felt this product was a tad thick creating that whiteness during application and just too strong in scent while you're sweating.  I am sure this product does do its job with sun protection but you can get the same result with a cheaper price tag and minimal scent to not irritate my nose and skin. Not worth the high price,Neutral
Burnout's Ocean Tested mix has some organic ingredients but this is not an acceptable mix for a high ZO. BurnOut is uzing the ZO mix as a marketing tool to sell chemicals to individuals who do not read the ingredients or have no idea about ingredients. From alcohol to gum to hardeners. I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide (non-nano) .%Other Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Water (Aqua) Glycerin Polysorbate  Stearic Acid Cetyl Alcohol Sorbitan Stearate Cetearyl Glucoside Stearyl Alcohol Polyhydroxystearic Acid Polyglyceryl- Ricinoleate Isostearic Acid Lecithin Xanthan Gum Carrageenan Helionori Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract Plantago Lanceolata (Plantain) Leaf Extract Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C) Ethylhexylglycerin.Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one blocks both UVA (- nm) and UVB (- nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water used in many industries in ointments creams and lotions. Non-irritating non-allergenic and non-comedogenic used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS - ZO which has a mean particle size greater than nm when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body do not enter the bloodstream and are not a threat to human health.SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes for example a person wearing SPF can be exposed to the sun without reddening for  times longer -  minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of % plus certified organic ingredients and FREE OF; fragrances perfumes additives softeners thickening agents gums alcohol biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone Oxybenzone UV Chemical absorbers paraben phthalates PABA and  dioxane. BABO has % ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with .% ZO. But ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. ZO is like mud the higher the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so for many high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy. One needs to try different mixes to find the mix acceptable to them based on ingredients feel and performance. For a small investment sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn pain cancer medical bills pain killers etc. that come with skin exposure to the sun. Mineral Not Physical...,Neutral
The Super Smooth Shampoo has done wonders for my hair in several different ways. I will start with the fact that this shampoo has a really nice scent and really offers a lovely perfume to the bathroom and also to your hair. This shampoo cleans my hair and really takes out all of the products that I put into my hair on a daily basis with ease. I am a huge fan of the Zero Sulfate formula with the Thermal Anti-fade Complex which really allows my hair to have a very beautiful natural shine to it. With me dying my hair quit often I am always looking for a shampoo that helps with keeping my color vibrant. I love that my hair's color doesn't' look faded when using this product. Plus since I use a straight iron almost daily I need a shampoo that has amazing ingredients to help protect my hair from being heat damaged. This product does just that.To complete my review I was also sent the Super Smooth Conditioner which offered me very manageable hair. The conditioner offers a way to really control those hair tangles while making my 'abused by the day hair' straight again. It helps add that extra 'wow' effect to my hair when used with the shampoo. They truly compliment each other. I could tell from the moment I applied the product into my hair and let it set for a few minutes that it was going to do wonders for my hair. I have dyed hair that is super long having a product that helps with preserving color and helps with tangles is a win with me. This product just as the shampoo has an amazing scent that lingers and also offers the extra protection from the flat iron. Also like the shampoo it truly delivers on everything it claims to.Just a few weeks of using these two products my hair has really transformed. My hair is shiny healthy and more manageable. Pureology Super Smooth Serious Colour Care with Thermal Antifade Complex Shampoo & Conditioner,Neutral
I bought this because it was on clearance at my local drugstore. I didn't realize it was orangish until I got home. The color blends with my skin fine and my pores seem a  tiny bit less noticeable but after one day of use I broke out. Because I wasn't sure this primer caused it I gave it two more tries. I now have a dry patch on my chin and that never happens to me in the summer time. I can't tell that my makeup actually looks better to be honest or that it stays on longer. Also it has a strong perfumey smell which could be an issue for people with sensitive skin. Can't tell much difference,sensitive skin
i bought this because i use the sebamed shampoo and i'm happy with it. the shampoo has a strong perfume smell and this soap has the same smell. it's really strong. it does fade quickly after the shower but i kinda don't like the fragrance. anyways i bought this bar soap after reading the reviews but it doesn't lather at all. it'll produce some lather after the bar is wetter. i'm not sure how to explain it. it takes time to lather up with this bar soap so my showers take longer. i don't like that. plus my skin feels drier but less drier than dove soap. also it doesn't remove waterproof sunscreen very well. I had to soap down several times to take the sunscreen off. again longer showers that i would like to avoid.i'm sorry that i had to give this a  star but it left my skin unclean and the very little lather is not acceptable. I rather use body wash that doesn't lather than non-lathering bar soap. i use the rest of the soap as hand soap. however I did like the sebamed body wash and that took off the sunscreen on the first soap down and lathered very well. no lather strong perfume,Neutral
Too perfumey and its hard to feel clean when there is no lather. I wouldnot purchase this item again. Its okay,Neutral
I have to say I love this product. In one use it's made my skin feel softer given it more color and decreased the saggy look on my right cheek. It's very gentle. A bit overly perfumed but that's my only criticism of the product. I do feel from using it that it does what it says. I bought two of these bottles for a total of $ at the local supermarket so the price is a bit steep however for those who can't find it locally you can order it here. I had purchased it on sale but the regular price at the supermarket is $.. I won't use anything else again for my face or body except for this wonderful product. I had purchased the soap bars but this is way better! There is a good amount of it so it should last a while. The flakes on my skin fell off after using this and my skin was not left irritated. I'm happy with the results and look forward to more positive results from Sebamed. I may try using this as a shampoo or just purchase the shampoo here on amazon as i can't find the shampoo or conditioner locally. Great product. It's actually helping my overly dry saggy skin!,great product
Product arrived REALLY fast! Packaging and product was in great condition and the  oz bottle is pretty big. I've used this perfume before and it smells lovely- I alway get complimented for smelling good love it!,Neutral
this is the best perfume ever I absolutly love it! It has a sweet and sexy smell and my boyfriend loves it! number one,Neutral
My boyfriend likes slightly sweeter scented perfumes and Sarah Jessica Parker's NYC is great but it just doesn't last.  The Sarah Jessica Parker line of scents is great like Covet and Dawn and NYC but NYC just doesn't last. I love this perfume,Neutral
This perfume smells good but it doesn't last that long. I was very disappointed because the dawn by SJP lasts all day and the perfume smells wonderful. It was a big let down. It's so so,Neutral
I couldn't believe I found this perfume on here for such a great price. I had tried a sample one day and the scent haunted me all afternoon. Every time I smelled it I loved it more and more. It's fun and flirty and perfect for a  sunny spring day. Such a fun scent,Neutral
I did not choose this for myself. I am very picky about my perfume but my husband gave it to me as a Christmas stocking stuffer. he read the reviews and got it based on that. I must say it smells Great! Very light strong smell only takes  or  sprays but it is a light scent very sweet my Husband says it smells strawberryish on me I thnk its more floral but either way that gives you a tasted of what you will get. the packaging is cute and it is very easy to take with you on the go. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!! Love it!,Neutral
This perfume to me has a slight fruity smell to it and I really like it.  Problem is that it doesn't seem to last very long after spraying it on.  I usually spray about three sprays - neck wrist and chest; and with that much I would expect it to last at least half a day.  I like it enough to continue buying it and wearing it for the price. Smells great but doesn't last too long,Neutral
I love Sex and the City and I love Sarah Jessica Parker so of course I had to check out SJP NYC which was inspired by the fabulous Carrie Bradshaw. I did not expect to like this fragrance because I'm not the type of girl who usually likes fruity perfume. However I was surprised by how much I loved it. There are some strawberry notes in there but this fragrance is also floral and musky and overall fantastic. The staying power could be a little better in my opinion but for the price this is a great deal. SATC fans will love it as will any other woman looking for a unique new scent to call her own. Simply fabulous,Neutral
I bought this perfume as a gift for a friend. She enjoys the fragrance very much so thought I'd surprise her with it as a gift. Very nice gift!,Neutral
I really wish this didn't have perfume in it. It broke my forehead out so I can't use it for my forehead which was the main are I wanted to treat. I will continue to use it on my crows feet and my neck. If you are sensitive to perfume don't use this. The smell is nice though. We will see,Neutral
Babyganics has done a nice job of making this hand soap user-friendly. I like that it is fragrance-free because I am allergic to some perfumes. Also I am grateful that it does not contain triclosan the so-called antibacterial ingredient that doesn't really make you cleaner and may be polluting our waterways. Up to now it has been difficult to find a liquid hand soap that is triclosan-free and also does not contain aloe to which I am allergic. So this product is very welcome.Another source says that this product contains Naturally Derived Plant-Based Cleaning Agents (Coconut Palm Kernel Corn and Sugar based surfactants) Water Preservative (less than .%). That sounds pretty good unless you are allergic to one of the ingredients. But what about the preservatives? They are listed on Amazon as Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone &#; similar names notice the &#;chlor&#; in the first if you want to keep them straight. I looked up both of these on a cosmetics database and found that they can both cause allergic reactions. I have not had a problem with them but I noticed that another reviewer suffered a reaction to this product to test this cautiously if you have sensitive skin. I believe all liquid soaps contain preservatives to discourage the growth of bacteria. Before using on an infant you might want to be cautious. Nice to have a non-scented liquid soap without triclosan.,sensitive skin
This instantly zapped moisture back into my straw-like flat winter hair. It is pretty heavy stuff though and the perfumed scent will last you until the second coming of Moses. However for a once or twice weekly deep conditioning shampooing this does the trick.Update: I have since stopped using this stuff. It caused my skin to break out like a  year old girl's face. Oily acne prone skin and shea butter seem to be a terrible combination. It's a shame because I have yet to find another shampoo that moisturizes my hair like this one did! Effective but heavy,Neutral
This product seemed to work. Buy I cannot believe that **anyone** can stand the smell. It smells just like super pungent old lady perfume- the kind of perfume that you can taste because its so so strong.The smell is absolutely horrific.Not only that but it turns out I am allergic to it. This shampoo is loaded with flowers. So when I used it to scrub my daughter's head I have been sneezing and sneezing ever since. I don't have any severe allergies but some flowers make me sneeze. If you want to smell like grandma perfume,Neutral
I've been using this product for months (I have short fine natural african american hair). I spied it at the store and the fact that it is supposed to be all natural seemed great.Initially the first day I used it I HATED the smell. Imagine a person who has used way too much perfume. I used it again though and over time got used to the smell.My hair is thicker and growing much more in my opinion. I use this when I am styling my hair (twists) or when I just need to moisturize it. I recommend squirting it into your hand and rubbing it around first so it's not just a big white glob.I never wash this out when I use it. I use it like a daily moisturizer and my hair feels great. It's still dry (which is the nature of most people's natural black hair) but it's growing and getting better! Definitely NOT a wash out conditioner but I love it!,Neutral
This has a bit of a perfume smell but it's not bad.  It is also in the low toxic range. You can use a ton of the stuff without any buildup or greasy feeling.  After the hair dries it feels a little on the dry side. Average,Neutral
I sometimes use Shea Moisture's Organic Coconut and Hibiscus Conditioning Curl and Style Milk as my morning hair moisturizer. It smells nice -- and everytime I use it most wonder what kind of perfume I'm wearing.My all-time favorite hair milk is still Karen's Body Beautiful Hair Ambrosia --- which provides all-day moisture for my hair and comes in a number of wonderful scents. But let's face it: KBB's too expensive now. KBB's decreased the amount of Hair Ambrosia for their customers albeit they hide it by putting it in a more sophisticated branded bottle and use ml instead of the .something oz you're actually getting. $ plus shipping for  oz does not equal a bargain in my book.Shea Moisture's product is almost half the price of KBB's Hair Ambrosia ($.). If you can buy it in a Target store you'll save shipping worries. Their product contains top-quality organic ingredients. It's thicker than KBBs Ambrosia (because it has organic shea butter KBBs contains none). Yes Shea Moisture doesn't have KBB's variety of scents (like white tea honey and oatmeal etc;). But it still smells great. Also Shea Moisture's hair milk isn't as moisturizing as KBB's  Hair Ambrosia but I think that's mainly due to the lack of vegetable glycerin. A really dedicated natural diva could buy glycerin and still come out ahead (price wise) when buying Shea Moisture compared to KBB's Ambrosia.A little goes a long way with Shea Moisture too. With such a quality product at a reasonable price AND I'm getting more for my money -- it's hard (for me) to justify buying KBB's Hair Ambrosia anymore... I've only given it four stars however because it's not as moisturizing (for me anyway) compared to KBB's.SHEA MOISTURE ORGANIC COCONUT and HIBISCUS Conditioning Curl and Style MilkIngredients:Deionized water Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)* Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil)* Isopropyl Myristate Sugar Starch Silk Protein Essential Oil Blend Melila Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil Caprylyl glycol Sorbitol Esters Algae Extract Hyssopus Officinalis Extract Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf and Equisetum Arvenese Extract Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract Tocopherol (Vitamin E) Price $..*Certified Organic A little goes a long way,long way
I love this eye cream and will reorder. First of all I'm a contact wearer and tend to have sensitive skin. This product doesn't irritate my skin or eyes in any way. It doesn't have any kind of odor or perfume that I've noticed.I'd describe the texture as a creamy gel. It's lightweight and absorbs like a gel; however it's just a bit more creamy and it moisturizes very nicely. The skin around my eyes stays hydrated for hours. I can't say it's a miracle worker but I don't expect miracles from topical products. I'm  and have some sun damage. I have pretty realistic expectations.All in all I would recommend this product and I will be reordering it myself. Really nice eye cream!,Neutral
This product is awesome! I love it! It is a great light-to-medium coverage that feel light-weight and gives excellent moisture. I love that is is  SPF instead of the typical  that is in most tinted moisturizers and makeups. It does have a sunscreen-like smell but it is not very strong. My skin is relatively dry and my sense of smell is very sensitive so to have a moisturizer that can double as makeup and not give me a migraine from the smell is very valuable to me. I also have very fair skin with many facial freckles which are not covered but accentuated by this product in a great way. I cannot recommend it enough! I have had a good relationship with Physicians Formula and was hoping they would come out with a tinted moisturizer product that did not have the perfumes like their other tinted moisturizers - low and behold: here it is!!! Light and Freckled Face,Neutral
I love the idea of this product...a temporary bronzing lotion as opposed to the usual streaky uneven self tanner. Unfortunately the perfume in this product is so insanely strong it makes me feel nauseated. Too bad I would probably buy it by the case if it didn't stink so badly. Great color terrible scent,Neutral
I read all the great reviews and sat on the fence for awhile before ordering. I've usedSublime Bronze - Gradual Self Tanning Lotion . Oz. (L'oreal)and been very pleased so I figured the one-day would be very similar. Once ordered the gel came very quickly (from Brook's).  The pump on the bottle was defective so I had to remove the whole cap to try the product.  In the bottle the gel is a dark cocoa brown the color of chocolate cake...but I digress.  It has a strong aroma that I like strong enough that you could probably by-pass perfume or wearing any other scents.  I however will not be doing that.  I put the gel on only one of my pale February legs so I could do a side-by-side comparison (and before such time I wanted to wear this in public). Well the result was weird.  The color had a reddish tone which didn't suit me at all.  If anything my skin has blue undertones.  I would never tan this color.  Maybe it would be ok for someone with darker skin or reddish tones.  So as to not be unfairly prejudiced I even mixed gel with lotion to dilute the color and tried it on the other leg.  It was still weird.  Also even when dry it felt tacky to the touch.  Sticky-like.  I did not feel remotely sexy or attractive which is pretty much the point of why I wanted a one-day bronzer in the first place.  I took photos with a cheap camera but I'm afraid the quality is such that they're not worth posting (you can't really see what I'm talking about). My leg looked shiny and reddish. I really wanted to like this product,Neutral
In hopes of saving a little money I purchased this lotion instead of FOREVER AFTER ALL DAY MOISTURIZER  FL OZ AUSTRALIAN GOLD. Lesson learned. The reviews for the Playboy lotion were pretty good but after using the product for several weeks now I'm just not impressed. It doesn't seem to moisturize quite like the Australian Gold. I have to reapply regularly which is  frustrating. Although several people bragged about the smell I'm not a big fan. It's a little too much for me..too perfumey. In the future I'll just spend the extra money to stick with a product I know I love. I'll Stick With Something Else,Neutral
I did not get to use this product long enough to determine its efficacy because the smell was way to overpowering. I felt like I could just dab some on my neck and use it as a daily perfume. I figured anything with that much perfume couldn't be good for my skin. Besides I found it highly irritating to be bombarded by this overpowering scent ages after I had applied it. I am not a perfume wearer and I did not intend to have my face cream make me into one. Way too much perfume,Neutral
Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum comes bearing the promise that it will penetrate into the skin's surface to deliver a super-concentrated amino-peptide +B complex.  It claims that it will provide extra hydration for the skin to make it significantly firmer looking and regenerate its appearance.  It claims to be fast absorbing and non-greasy and to give a user younger-looking skin without drastic measures within just five days. The skin it claims will be plumped and look brighter and more radiant.  This particular skin product also comes to my house enthusiastically spoken of by some friends and acquaintances.I have been using this product for at least the recommended five days and I do believe I see some change for the better and brighter in my skin.  Mind you as I've recently said in reviewing another skin product I've reached the age --I'm retired after all -- where I've been spending heavily on department store products and cosmoceuticals that promise exactly the same results.  And I've also been investing in some procedures that promise the same results.  So maybe I really can't make this fine a judgment call and shouldn't be reviewing this product now or at all.  Nevertheless I do think I see some extra results.  And I do not appear to be allergic to this product nor does it appear to be upsetting my skin as some other products do: the package states it has been dermatologically tested so as to be non-comedogenic; that is it won't clog the pores causing breakouts nor does it appear to be heavily perfumed.The product goes on smoothly is pleasant enough to deal with and in comparison to some department store brands and cosmoceuticals is quite reasonably priced.  And it appears to deliver on its claims.  So what don't I like about it?  It is a Proctor and Gamble product and as a card-carrying PETA member I have been trying to boycott P & G's multifarious products for upwards of fifteen years.  The firm has a long record of treating animals terribly in its laboratories and to me no skin cream is worth the suffering of innocent creatures.  There are many other comparable skin care products delivered to market without animal testing: you've only got to read the labels to find them.  So I've been doing for fifteen years and so I will continue to do. It Appears to Deliver on its Claims,Neutral
I dabbed this on my wrist in the store to check color. It was perfect reviews online were great I needed good coverage for acne and so I bought it. I smelled it in the store and it didn't have any smell then. I guess since there's so many smells I didn't pick it up but when I got home and put it all over my face I noticed it smells really weird. Not like perfume like a lot of liquid foundations do... maybe a chemical smell. I tried washing it off with hot water and soap and it took foreverrrrrrr! This stuff STAYS! I finally got it off and could still smell it on my skin FIVE HOURS later! Maybe most people won't notice since they use other products with a smell but I only use fragrance free items so for me it was overwhelming and nasty. Good thing I bought it at Rite Aid where I can return it even though it's been used. :( Stays forever but stinks!!,Neutral
I really did not like this makeup. It is incredibly oily but at the same time it leaves a caked-on-makeup look on your skin even when it is applied in the thinnest of layers. The &#;nude&#; color is very yellow. I have redish-pink skin and it made me look almost green. You have to apply a lot because the coverage is not great at all. It kind of feels like you're putting actual paint on your skin because it doesn't disguise the flaws and just sits on top of your skin without blending or soaking in. The worst part is the smell which is VERY strong. It lingers for as long as you wear the makeup AND for a few hours after you've scrubbed it off. The only way to describe the smell is like a very elderly person's perfume. Somehow it just smells like every funeral home I can ever remember being in. Ugh it is definitely not worth the buy. Smells Awful & Cakes On Skin,Neutral
Though this is not one of my favorites I do like the scent. Unfortunately it fades rather quickly and I highly doubt I'll repurchase it. This perfume also arrived with the cap missing and had leaked (Amazon promptly sent me a replacement)! Smells good but doesn't last...,Neutral
Beyonce Heat By Beyonce For Women Eau De Parfum Spray .-Ounce /  MlI just stumbled across this scent while browsing the perfume aisle. I love trying new scents but I tend to be cautious because I have gotten some that as soon as I got home and put them on I hated them... Definately NOT the case with Heat by Beyonce. I have fallen in love with this scent and it may become my new signature spray. =) I usually do not buy celeb scents they just don't last very long or they go on way to strong and they are gone by lunch time or you have to spray on a gallon to make it through the work day. NOT with this one. I can put it on in the morning and in the evening I am still able to enjoy it. =) I have gotten a few compliments on this as well. I've only had it for a couple of days but I can certainly say I will keep it around.Just an FYI it doesn't take very much application either just a couple of strategically placed spritzes. Beyonce Heat by Beyonce for women,Neutral
I love the scent of this perfume it's very unique and seductive. Heat lasts all day and is just perfect! very seductive,Neutral
Well I'm not that big of a Beyonce fan but this perfume smells so wonderful.  I bought it a while back and it's almost gone.  I'm more into body oils nowadays and if they make it into a body oil I'm sure I'd buy that as well.  I really haven't worn spray perfume in years so this was a pleasant surprise.  If you like sweet fresh and flirty scents this might be for you! I Love It!,Neutral
it's so pungent musky and strong. it smells like an expired old fashioned 's perfume that you'd find lying around in a thrift shop. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Don't wear this to work for the lovE OF GOD. People are gonna think you stink. musky plummy old woman scent.,Neutral
not the smell i was looking for i just use it as when all else fails when i run out of the good stuff im more of a sweet flowery perfume girl i never smelled it before i bought it guess i wanted it because beyonces name was on it not for me,Neutral
i am so happy with this perfume! i went back to Macy's and bought the lotion! It's the longest lasting perfume i have ever tried! and i'm glad it does last long since it smells amazing :) i can't get enough of it!!! my boyfriend likes it too so that is always a plus LOVE it!,Neutral
This is a review for shade #. Revlon Colorsilk is reliable and inexpensive. Plus it comes in the kind of containers that can be recapped. If I am careful to mark increments on the bottles I can mix a smaller amount in a separate container for touch-up - which is what I need to cover well areas that are now coming in white just at the temples and making me look old can't have THAT!The rest of my hair is not naturally all one color. Parts have always been platinum blonde but the underneath is darker very close to this color. But this color adds wonderful depth and shine. It is really nearly a dark blonde when applied to my rather dark blonde hair but adds just a smidge of red that really brings up the overall effect. Instead of a bottle blonde it creates a natural look which is exactly what I'm after.Shades of color are impossible to put into words but I'm hoping my remarks might help you decide. It really is a quite-light and vibrant blonde-brown lighter I think than the package illustration.Beware the conditioner that comes with though. It is horribly perfumed and that perfume doesn't wash out and in the past has kept me from attending functions where scents are not allowed because so many people have difficulty breathing when subjected to this kind of allergen. Now I simply throw away the little conditioner packets and use my own non-offensive conditioner. Light Golden Brown: richness shine,Neutral
I love lotion. I buy lotion by the truckload usually because my stuff gets quickly swiped by my friends & family. (Or because I dry out faster during the summer & winter.) This is one of the - brands that I'll regularly use when I'm at home although I'll admit that my usage depends greatly on what is on sale at the time & how much I'm willing to spend. Curel normally isn't that expensive so I use it quite frequently when I'm looking for something that isn't a perfume lotion. (In my experience lotions for specific perfumes usually aren't that great at long-term moisturizing.)The original formula of Curel does have a nice light fragrance to it so if you are sensitive to fragrances for whatever reason or just want something fragrance-free there is one made without the fragrance.The lotion pretty much does exactly what it says. It moisturizes well & lasts a pretty long time. It isn't quite  hours for me but then I'm prone to drier skin than most people I know. I will say though that a little bit of this stuff goes a long way & depending on how much you slather on you will want to give it a little time to dry before going about doing what needs done. (Or wait at getting dressed if you use it on your legs or body.)Overall this is a product that works. Regardless of how many times I've purchased it it works each time & has won a spot in my buy regularly column for lotions. Fantastic stuff a little goes a long way!,little bit
I am  years old and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair. I have tried literally every shampoo brand on the market Tressemme Matrix Pantene Garnier Aussie Aveda L'Oreal and I even went all out and blew right through my $. of birthday money on stupid useless Wen...ha! what a waste that was! My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well. It was soft super sleek and had the highest level of shine that I had ever seen. But because I have naturally pin-straight but VERY thick hair I wanted more volume instead of having a flat look all the time. I saw this in my local Walgreens one day and decided that I would buy it along with my Suave products. The botttle is what mainly held my attention first. It was in a very nice packaging as well a yellow orange bottle with an orange-and-green cap. The price was also astonishingly cheap as well $. which is as much as my Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo. So I decided to give it a shot and at least attempt to try it. When I used this in the shower the first thing that I noticed was the amazing scent. It smelled mainly like a Nectarine or a Peach which I loved. It also did not cause my severe asthma sinus disease and chronic bronchitis to flare up as well (the Garnier Tressemme Aveda and even Wen made it flare up really bad to the point that I would be suffocating/wheezing in the shower.). This product also lathers extremely well and when I applied it to my hair and scalp it felt smooth and creamy. Even though this is a clear shampoo this did not strip the natural oils from my hair either. I was so suprised when I blow-dried my hair on the usual cool setting. My pin-straight thick and shiny hair was even thicker and was shining like glass.I have been using this product for about a month (along with my Suave of course!) and I constantly get compliments about how nice my hair looks. My friends (who use Wen) ask me What shampoo do you use on your hair? It looks so thick and shiny! and I simply reply Suave and Herbal Essences and they look at me dumbfounded. Even complete strangers from the doctor's office to my school teachers ask me the same question and I reply with the same answer. Even my hairstylist asks me what I use to make my hair so thick and strong. She herself looked shocked when I told her it was the $. bottle of Herbal Essences and the $. bottle of Suave Naturals.Oh and I forgot to mention this before but the amazing scent of this shampoo lingers for DAYS! Yesterday when I was walking home from school with my best friend she asked me what perfume I was wearing because it smelled so nice. I actually told her that It was the Herbal Essences shampoo that I was using. She jokingly replied That shampoo does it all huh?She's right. This shampoo has to be the best shampoo that I have used besides Suave hands down!.PROS:* AMAZING SMELL that lasts for days!* Great lather.* Intense body and shine.* No unnecessary buildup.* It made my hair stronger within  weeks of use.CONS:* Ummmm...NONE! Excellent product! :),Neutral
This is a great conditioner! I constantly dye my hair and this conditioner prevents it from feeling rough or straw-like it also keeps my hair nice and shiney. People are often complimenting me on the smell too assuming it is some kind of perfume. Love this product. Love this,Neutral
My favorite scent from the Salvatore Incanto perfumes.  It smells so delicate and subtle perfect for any season.  I always buy this scent. Smells Amazing,Neutral
I have almost all of the incanto scents and i must say that this one to me is one of the best! Each one of the bottle are really pretty and the blend of the scents are combined excellenly together. You know how with some perfumes you'll read the description of that particular product and when u get it you can just smell just one of the scents listed? well Salvatore Ferragamo really knows how to blend while making the most beautiful scent. I really love his products and with all of them the scents last all day. OMG,Neutral
I simply love this perfume it's really great and it shipped fast and without any damage. Its sweet fragrance is fabulous. My favorite perfume,favorite perfume
I have been using this for two weeks now. It has a very light foam wash to it that is not too dense but not overly foamy. It cleanses well with a very nice clean scent that is not overbearing.I know a lot of reviewers have commented on the `natural' part of the product. If you look at the ingredients I can see why it is questioned. However I think Johnson and Johnson were aiming at using plant and fruit derived ingredients with a very light scent that is not loaded with perfume. Plus it has the J&J; trademark of no more tears.I enjoy this cleanser and plan on using it on my newborn daughter. It is very gently but cleans well. J&J; is a trusted name in this household and this is another product I will be buying in the future. Gentle but great,Neutral
MY SITUATION:I am not a baby but was born with sensitive skin. For years I tolerated itchy scalp. After awhile my ears also started itching. My doctor suspected I was allergic to my shampoo and suggested switching to another type. I tried several shampoos over the last couple of years but nothing solved the problem. I was prescribed medication for my ears but preferred a preventative approach.WHAT ARE Sodium Laureth Sulfate Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate?My online research revealed that many shampoos contain an ingredient called Sodium Laureth Sulfate a foaming agent that produces that nice thick lather we love.  The problem is that some people find it irritating. I looked at the label of my shampoo and saw that it was the second ingredient on the list. It is associated with another ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which is also an irritant.I should mention that these two ingredients are *not* to be confused with another ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate. Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate is derived from coconut and palm and is considered safe. These three names are all very similar which can make things confusing.NATURAL PRODUCTS:I eventually found J&J;'s Natural Baby Shampoo which doesn't contain Sodium Laureth/Lauryl Sulfate.  This shampoo is in their Natural line of products. Although it's made for babies I hoped it would work for me because I have fine hair and sensitive skin.First of all it was difficult finding this shampoo locally. Many stores carry J&J; shampoos but not the Natural line. If they carry the Natural line it was usually out of stock. I went to at least five stores before finding it. Although I chain-link my errands I suppose it would have been better to just buy it on Amazon from the start but I wanted to try it before buying the -pack.RESULTS:Anyway the first thing I noticed is that this shampoo is watery. But I can accept that because it doesn't include those thickening ingredients that might be irritating my skin. Just be careful when you pour it so that it doesn't drip out of your hand.It also doesn't lather as easily as regular shampoo so you have to get over yearning for a head full of lather. I do miss the lather but it's a trade-off. I do miss the fragrance of my old brand but then again perfume can be an irritant as well.*Update: Please note that I received a helpful tip (see comment) to first lather the shampoo in your hands and add water before putting it on your head.However it does what it's supposed to do... it cleans just as well as my other shampoos. It doesn't leave my hair oily as I was expecting. So the bottom line is that I am happy with this shampoo and am willing to trade-off thick shampoo and rich lather for a mild and effective shampoo.PROS:- Does not contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.- Cleans gently but cleans effectively- Reasonable priceCONS:- Doesn't lather- WateryRECOMMENDATION:- In spite of the CONS I still recommend this shampoo to someone who is sensitive to other shampoos. I am still giving  stars since I like the idea of less irritating synthetics and more natural ingredients. Of course everyone's chemistry is unique so the only way to know how it works for you is to try it. At least it's not expensive. Hope this helps. Cleans my fine hair and doesn't contain Sodium Laureth / Lauryl Sulfate.,sensitive skin
Our youngest (as of this review almost ) has eczema on her arms and legs that we have to constantly watch.  We use Huggies Baby Wash extra sensitive fragrance free and I would say that this compares well with it.  We've also used California Baby and as far as we can tell all of these are about the same.  It's hard to really tell since there are quite a few other factors (humidity clothing diet etc)This does come with a foaming dispenser which helps distribute the wash more evenly.  You don't seem to get very much out of each pump - a good thing since that means less is wasted when the kids play with it.The scent is stronger than I would have wanted but not unpleasant.  Although they claim natural scents I would have still preferred something with a softer scent or no perfume at all.What seems to help our daughter's eczema is regular application of Aquaphor after bathingThanks for reading! Sudsy and scented...Note that Natural does not mean Organi,Neutral
I can really feel and see the difference with Biolage vs other shampoos. My hair comes out clean soft and full. the price for this is worth it for the big shampoo bottle alone but the balm should last a very long time as it is only needed x a week and very little goes a long way. The shampoo smells nice without being perfumey or overpowering. The balm has no scent and will weigh down hair if you use too much. I recommend pairing the shampoo with the Biolage conditioner of your choice (I'm using the bamboo one now.) Top notch product. Wonderful product,long way
Personally I like the product.I'm into making my own body salves and hair 'grease/dressing/pomade/cream'(whatever you want to call it).  My current concoction looks like a creamy mousse.  I simply added some of this Tropical Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) to it and I like the results.  Our hair seems to be growing and we've experienced no adverse side effects to date.  Our scalps have not been itchy since applying the product and the stickiness isn't an issue because I added this to a homemade hair grease/pomade (at least  capfuls to about oz of hair cream.I'm not going to mention all the ingredients but to give you an idea my homemade hair creams and body salves are made of natural oils such as virgin coconut oil extra virgin olive oil unrefined avocado oil jojoba a few nut oils true ivory unrefined shea butter(softened by stirring with a fork NOT MELTED!!) calendula essential oil tea tree essential oil myrrh ylang ylang extra...you get the idea all natural ingredients.  For the summer only I added about  drops of vegetable glycerine to it to pull moisture out of the air and into our hair.  Don't do that in Winter because the air is dry from the heaters and furnaces being on and it will pull the moisture out of your scalp and the inside of your hair to moisturize the outside of your strand which will quickly cause damage and breakage.  Vegetable glycerine is great for moisturizing during humid months.Also I don't get what the big fuss is about the smell.  It doesn't smell good or bad to me and since it's mixed into a hair dressing when I apply it I don't smell it afterward in my or my daughter's hair.I will say that I also bought the same brand JBCO Hair food which has a much more pungeant smell/odor than this oil.  I added some of this JBCO to it as well and applied that to our hair and scalp.  We still don't see what is offensive about the scent and I can barely if at all smell it once it's in our hair.  My suggestion is that one could add a good essential oil to the bottle to tweak the smell.  I'd only put up to  drops though for such a small bottle.  Essential oils are powerful with wonderful benefits but could make you sick if not diluted well.  Always remember that essential oils can be diluted with oil only so if you spill some or use it too concentrated on the skin or scalp take coconut olive any vegetable or carrier oil will do to clean it off.  Water won't do any good because essential oils are oil soluble.  Wash it off with the vegetable/carrier oil then wash that off with soap and water.  Another suggestion is that this brand of JBCO is also sold in scented varieties.  The only one I've seen so far is Lavender.  It's supposedly slightly thinner in consistency but people seem to like it and it smells good so the reviews say (I haven't and don't plan on trying it I'm satisfied with this original).If you're going to add essential oil to this JBCO I recommend calendula blood orange lavender...something with a nice scent.  You could use fragrant oils manufactured exclusively for fragrancing cosmetics/soaps/candles and the like but I wouldn't go that route unless you can find some made with plant oils and extracts instead of synthetic chemicals and no I am not talking about body oils that you wear like perfume.  I guess you could but I personally would not.Anyway I liked the way our homemade hair dressing and the Tropical Isle Living JBCO Hair Food worked before but adding the JBCO to them seemed to increase the results of what we were looking for:  shine manageability softening sealing and growth.This oil seems fine to me and I plan to buy much more of it. so far so good,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfume to wear when I am going out to dinner with my boyfriend because he just love the way this scent smells on me. Also when I wear this perfume to work my co-workers always ask me what am I wearing. Even when I am walking down the street I get so many compliments on this perfume. The perfume last for about  hours so I suggest you walk with a small one in your purse and re-apply during the day. The scent is very sweet consisting of violet and orchid. I recommend this perfume for anybody who likes to smell sweet. smells great,favorite perfume
I have never used anything for Halle I was online and looking for something new to add to my collection...I was inclined to buy it because of the raving reviews. This is my second time buying perfume online...I usually HAVE to SMELL my scents first. I LOVE LOVE perfumes...and I received this rather fast and so far soo good. I haven't worn it as yet. (hence I didn't want to give a full hundred) I have sprayed it though to get a sense of the actual smell. And I love what I smell so far. I had a friend who was with me when it arrived and she loved it as well. After I have worn it I will add my comments.... Love me some Halle......,Neutral
This is the only perfume I have owned that I used the entire bottle of! I own hundreds of dollars worth of perfume but this is the one I keep going back to every single day. I love love love this perfume. It has a light scent so it doesn't overwhelm which I love because strong perfumes tend to give me headaches. Every time I wear it it makes me think of cotton candy. It has a very sweet candyish smell. The only downfall is because it is so light it tends not to last all day unless you put on more than you normally would. I put a little more on than normal and at first it is strong but after a few minutes it fades to a good level. I was shocked to see it at my local dollar store in a gift box for % off after Christmas. I got the gift set for around  dollars and it was right after my other bottle had run out.I do want to add that since the second time I got the gift set I tried out the body wash but it smells nothing like the perfume. It is much stronger than the perfume and I smell it on my skin all day long. I do not like it at all...the scent of the body wash it much more floral. My favorite perfume!,Neutral

I give this  stars because it is a great deal for  oz and I love the way the mico BP feels smooth and penetrates quickly. But one star taken away for the perfume smell. Why Dr. Rhodan and FIelds why? Why add a scent to benzoyl peroxide? I don't get it. On it's own it has little or no smell. I hate when companies add extra smell and colors for no reason! It smells like old lady perfume to me So now I smell like an old lady when I roll into bed. It's not really bad but I am super sensitive to smells so I don't think I will be buying this again. This has added perfume/scent,Neutral
A lot of products similar to this use harsh ingredients to provide exfoliation and then have heavy chemicals to moisturize or treat acne but I really love this product because it's simplicity. It provides gentle exfoliation for skin without any dyes perfumes or chemicals. I appreciate that it's NOT designed to do anything but exfoliate with gentle tiny beads. It doesn't even irritate my acne prone skin. If I could give it  stars I would. Worth the cost. gentle but effective,Neutral
While I did like the clean look of the bottle and the fact that the shampoo itself is clear (no additonal chemicals to color it) I can't give it as high a rating as I would like.Fine Hair Solutions does do a nice job.  And it's available at a good price.  I don't like it as well as my Paul Mitchell shampoo for fine hair.  To be fair the Pantene Pro-V is much cheaper.My biggest concern may not deter others from liking this shampoo.  While there are a few safe ingredients I was concerned about a few of the chemicals listed.  I wish manufacturers would also stop adding fragrance.  If deodorant has it and hair spray has it and you use perfume how many fragrances do you need at one time?  But until more women feel this way companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix.  To be REALLY fair I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles.  Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos.While I am not chemically sensitive others are.  But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store.  So for the value oriented person who is unconcerned about chemicals I would say this is a good deal. Good product but.....,Neutral
How many different ways can they market conditioner? A zillion apparently. Well anyway this is just like all the other stuff on the shampoo/conditioner aisle in the store. Sure it's decent but do we really need a new conditioner? I say no. Just lower the prices of this junk. And stop adding perfume to everything. Let us put on perfume if we want not just because we took a shower we now smell like a flower store. And don't tell me I didn't review this product. This is a bottle of conditioner just like every other bottle I've ever owned. Different smell different bottle. Same old same old. Same old same old.,Neutral
I am not a Pantene product user however I use a conditioner every day.  I was pleased with the results of the Pantene conditioner on my hair but wish that Pantene didn't put so much perfume into this product.This Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Flat to Volume conditioner gives my layered shoulder length hair a nice shine.  It doesn't leave a noticeable residue so my hair also feels bouncy and light.The only negative is the conditioner's heavy perfume scent. The perfume scent is very strong out of the bottle and lasts the entire day on my hair.  Some might consider this a nice thing but for those who are scent sensitive the heavy perfume scent is too much.  It is not a necessary component of the product so I personally wish Pantene would make a non-scented version. stars because of the heavy perfume scent. It is so strong that I will not be a repeat user. Nice Product - Hair is Bouncy & Has a Nice Shine! Product Contains Heavy Perfume Scent.,Neutral
The amazing pine scent is what sold me on this product when I first smelled it in the store. The bottle is huge so it lasts a long time. The body wash is moisturizing refreshing and leaves my sensitive skin soft and smooth. Since I try to avoid body washes with chemical ingredients or perfumes I like that this one has no sulfates phthalates artificial fragrances or animal testing. When I use it the pine and ginseng scent isn't as strong as when I smelled it in the bottle but it's still a nice natural aromatherapy wash for the bath or shower. Refreshing Pine Scent,long time
I love this stuff!  I never ever thought about getting a serum primer until I kept seeing this advertized in magazines.  It seemed like it would just be another thing to have to keep buying.  Well it's worth it.  It goes on so well and doesn't feel greasy at all.  It just feels good!  And it smells good--nothing perfumey.  While I'm not totally certain it makes foundation look better I do know it makes my skin feel better--like hydrated. :) Ooooooooo La-La . . . .,Neutral
Right out of the box the little glass perfume container was very hot it was almost too hot to hold in my hands so I put it down and let it cooled for a bit. Once it cooled down I sprayed some on my wrist and it has a nice floral scent to it its pleasant and light.

I have been color treating my hair for years and years.  I finally found a product where I just use this after my color and it feels like soft subtle hair again. I have very thick wiry hair that needs a deep conditioner.  This one is not too perfume smelling and also keeps penetrating the hair long after others fail.I have never ever found a product I could use at home with the same results as a salon deep conditioner till now.I have purchased about three of these from amazon.  One from the mall kiosk where they sell the herstyler products (beware they rip people off at the mall).LOVE IT AFTER I COLOR IT I ONLY USE THIS!,Neutral
I used this on two different days without my husband's knowledge in an attempt to see if it actually does anything. He didn't act any differently than usual.The scent was a little strange. It wasn't super powerful so it didn't bother me a lot but it definitely wasn't what I would buy just as a perfume. I don't think anyone noticed the smell other than myself though so that's a plus. I didn't try to hide it with perfume because I thought that might skew the results of my experiment but I think that you could hide the scent pretty easily. Tested on my husband. No reaction.,Neutral

A few years ago I bought a pheromone spray that worked. It seemed to make people a little nicer to me. Since I had luck with pheromone sprays in the past I figured I'd try this out. It smells like cheap cologne for a teenage boy. I only sprayed it once and gave me a headache. Too much comes out of the spray. My husband didn't know I was trying out a new perfume. When he got near me he said Whoa! That's a lot of perfume! He didn't like the smell so I tried to wash it off. I couldn't wash it off so I tried putting my own perfume over it but that didn't help. My husband is normally very affectionate with me but this repelled him. I was thinking that this product didn't work. However I used it yesterday by dabbing only a little bit behind my ear and people did seem more at ease with me. I still haven't made up my mind about it. It smells like a teenage boy's cheap cologne.,little bit
I think when you use this it's more of a state of mind than anything else. Sort of a &#;if you think it's working then you'll feel sexier and if you feel sexier you'll look sexier..&#; kind of thing.  It smells a bit masculine but the scent fades quickly. I just put it on with my own perfume. Would I recommend this? Yes .. sure! It's a fun item. Smells nice ...,Neutral
I have the oil and the perfume. I prefer the smell of the perfume way more. Pleasant smell. I do think over the oil works better though but the perfume does not make me dizzy. So I think combining the two is best a little bit of both. I don't see a huge difference in how men act but my SO has been more attentive so I guess it's worth it. Great smell,little bit

I hate most perfumes they give me ( & my bf) a headache- this smells a bit like I bathed in gain- but better! I read these reviews before buying and the fact that it  layered  well was a big + for me- thought I'd  pay it fwd and say it is worth the extra $$$ to me! I love this stuff!,Neutral
Hello all! I was in the market for a new set of brushes and came across these. I was VERY nervous at first because it was amazon and I couldn't feel the texture. When I got the brushes there was the permanent marker smell that everyone is complaining about but when I aired the case out  and sprayed my perfume on the case the smell went away. It's still faintly there but nowhere near as much. After washing the brushes and letting them fully dry I applied my makeup and didn't get any of the shedding. The large brushes are not good quality whatsoever. They are not stiff or dense enough to pat on loose powder or to pick up your brush. Soft brushes are good but too soft of brushes can be a pain. The fan brush is tiny qith this set an really thin so i wouldnuse it to sweep excess makeup off the skin and definitely not for contouring. The reason I did give this product  stars despite the quality of the large brushes because every other brush in the set is fantastic! The shader brushes pick up color very well and work great. Also the eyebrow brushes and the sponge/smudge brush is amazing. Overall I will have to replace - brushes in the set but other than that I love this makeup set. MASH  PC Brush Set,Neutral
I know this is priced for the Marc Jacobs nameplate but it smells like something you could pick up at any number of bath and body boutiques for far less. It is a light golden fruity floral like so many others on the market. I was so excited for this launch but I can't bring myself to spend this much money on a scent that smells like shampoo. If you're looking for something similar at a better price Mariah Carey's Honey perfume smells almost identical to this. Waste of Money,Neutral
I absolutely love honey by Marc Jacobs. I'm hoping it's the real deal. I have been buying seeing and reading too many unauthentic perfumes being sold by Amazon. And frankly I'm tired of it.

Love this citrus-based perfume!  Lightweight and simple but still has an elegant finish that makes me feel like I'm dressing up.  Took one star off because it doesn't seem to have a lot of staying power (couple hours max).Side note:  Best price I've found.  Normally I'd buy from Sephora but even with their triple point promotiion going right now this price is $ cheaper than any other place. Lightweight citrusy perfume,Neutral

My hair is so thick naturally curly so frizzy I live in Florida the Sunshine State and the Super Humid State as well I've tried from A to Z to tame my frizzy hair from famous brands as Moroccan oil Ojon Straight Sexy Hair Alterna Caviar Paul Mitchel Awapuhi Keratin Products and so on. I could say these products help a lot but nothing seems to be good enough for my type of hair and this humid weather. I even have compared my hair with the weather totally unpredictable!!! Until I got this product on my hands...this is the only product so far which I could say bye-bye to the frizz for good even on a very humid day. Now I'd see my curls well define I have beautiful natural curls my mother is latina my father chinese my hair is from the mix of these two genes. Every body at work admire my hair and always receive compliments on how beautiful my curls look I used to have my hair on a pony tail most of the time. I found this product at Macy's the cost is $. so I don't really see any big difference in between Macy's and Amazon's price. I would buy it over and over again on dry or humid conditions I will always have it in my beauty products as one of the must have... I'd like to add something else to this comment of mine. First of all people are writing on their comments about STENCH to me that word is for something completely unpleasant and let me say this: I am a very selective person when I have to pick a perfume or even a disinfectant to clean my house strong smells get me headache and even nausea certainly this product isn't good because it's smell to me a good product is because it works...the smell of this product isn't like candy flowers or perfumes I wish it could smell the same as Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin but it doesn't! so when I apply this product I try to put some over my hair while is damp and after it gets dry as well I don't blow dry my hair. The smell goes away after a while doesn't stay on my hair for a whole day neither!...Now I don't understand the second opinion of a consumer she wrote: the hair feels rough after you rinsed the product off your hair YOU DON'T RINSE THIS PRODUCT OFF YOUR HAIR YOU HAVE TO LEAVE IT ON! The  oz. bottle cost is $. and I use my hair long I have very thick hair and believe me that bottle has been with me for months already probably from  to  months it lasts for ever!!!. Well every body have different opinions but I am just being honest that's all!!!!!! THE BEST OF THE BEST FOR MY FRIZZY HAIR...,Neutral
Thanks to a nice youtuber for suggesting this product because I will always purchase it. It offers great slip when used with silicon mix which I liked before any way.UPDATE: A year ago I discovered that this product is best used x per month in the final stage of washing. It doesn't moisturize my hair but it gives me decent slip so I use a moisturizing conditioner (leave on for  minutes) wash it out and follow it with Kanechom mixture (leave on for  minutes).  Also it has a perfume smell which I don't like in my hair product. I Really like this,Neutral
Even though this product is unavailable i used it -months ago and it is fantastic. I mixed it with toque magico emergencia treatment and it was the best my hair ever looked. i love the fragrance. its like perfumed butter it dissolves  easily into your hair. This product is great on afro hair wavy hair or dry damaged hair. i really wish Amazon would keep it in stock along with the Kanechom gloss and the Kanechom Crystal. These products are almost impossible to find because they are from Brazil. I really wish Amazon would be the official web sitefor kanechom. The entire line. If u can get Kanechom karite shea butter get it immediately and buy  at a time stock up on them they are difficult to find and its the best hair care line for people with dry brittle wavy curly breaking thick afro hair and alltypes of hair can benefit  from such a fantastic  treatment. best kept secret,Neutral
My wife has very curly hair and was always trying to find products to help control the frizz and tangles. I ordered this product for her to see if it would help. She really liked this product and said that there was a noticeable improvement with her hair. She found it a lot easier to brush and style and she was pleased that it wasn't overly perfume-y like other hair care products. She said she will definitely keep using this product. My wife loves this...,Neutral
I noticed an immediate difference after using this conditioner.  My hair was soft and non-frizzy and looked healthier.  So on that front it's a great product.  I'm knocking off a star though because like all the other Pantene products I've tried the smell is too perfumed and smells vaguely chemical.  This is a pet peeve of mine I admit and probably most people won't be bothered by it.  But before you buy it smell it and ask yourself if that's what you want to smell like all day. Works great but too perfumed,great product
My Hair: Long (just past shoulders) very curly and extremely frizzy brown thickPantene Curly Hair smells good. A little perfumey but light. My hair is really soft after using it. I tried it alone and with several different conditioners. No matter what conditioner I used my hair was still frizzy. I examined my dry ends after using it and they were a little better but still dry.This shampoo is nice but wish I could find one that really would eliminate frizz. Soft but Still Frizzy,Neutral
This tamed and smoothed my long salt and pepper hair without making it feel flat and lifeless.  I am loving this shampoo.Sometimes conditioner can weigh my hair down so I try not to use it that often.  I don't have to use any conditioner when I use this shampoo.  It gives my hair the perfect blend of bounce and shine with beautiful body.  I also like that it smells fresh and clean not like perfume.Pantene has always been a favorite shampoo of mine.  I'm happy with this line of hair product as it exactly targets what my hair needs! Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Shampoo,Neutral
I have not always been a fan of Pantene products -- but this one changed my mind.  First:  it smells great - fresh clean and not overly perfumed. Second: great bubbly lather that rinsed cleanly. I have naturally curly hair which tends to be dry.  This shampoo left my hair moisturized but not weighted down.  I was impressed with how soft managable my hair is and I think it tamed frizzies pretty well. Great- I'd buy this again,Neutral
Every hair stylist I've been to has always told me to steer away from products that list alcohol among the first ingredients Pantene being among them.I've tried hair products that cost between $ and $ with so little difference.  I don't know if it's because I have thick hair but there's only so much that topical agents can do.  Like others I've not noticed any difference in the end result with this conditioner.  What's surprising is that I haven't had to use as much conditioner as I normally do.  It goes a long way.This has a clean scent to it...not flowery or perfumey.  Does well in detangling hair and it might be more economical than other Pantene conditioners since less is needed.  No matter what your favorite is you always need to rotate products to avoid product buildup. Not too bad for thick/coarse hair,Neutral
Let me start of by saying....I am a African American female with thick coarse shoulder lenght hair. Its also permed and colored....This shampoo works really good and you only have to use a little at a time..ususally i have to squeeze like / times out of a regular sstore brought shampoo bottle....but no way not with this i dont i would say bout a  quater size would do me good....and it leaves my hair and scalp so clean and it smells fresh for days....i was riding down the road in the car with my sister and when we made to where we was gng she told am glad u didnt where no perfume today because you r hair smell good and strong but soft...i also use this with masque and leave-in....and its perfect for a daily wash or my once a wk wash....Do highly recommand this product to any one...i have using this for a month now...and nothing has gotten worse but better...for me..i looked in my local stores at the time i was comparing prices on Amazon while in Target and CVS Pharmacy in my local area...Amazon prices or a little bit cheaper and reasonable then those two stores....for DermOrganic Argan Oil products... BEST BY FAR,little bit
I've only used this twice so I will come back and update once I've used it for a few days or a week to review if it does indeed make the skin look better but I wanted to say something about the smell. I have found many creams like this have a very strong headache inducing perfume smell. This does have a strong smell but it does NOT give me a headache it reminds me of cucumbers or something. I can't quiet place it. The smell does not bother me at all and I am a person who is very bothered by smells. I've stopped using many skin creams and shampoo's due to smell alone. It's a kind of natural fresh smell. Reminds me of cucumbers. So far so good. A review about the smell,Neutral
Having normal skin I may not be the best client for this beauty product.Now at nearly  years I think my face could use a wrinkle preventer using a mystical 'Swiss apple stem cell' therapy  (chuckle).I followed the instructions by doing a thorough face wash I then applied the goopy thick cream.I was please to notice it is not highly perfumed. I was not pleased to notice that it does not blend into the skin.To begin I applied Eclos Cream in the morning before going into the garden to work. Not only does it block the skin from perspiring my face had small bits of grass and whatever else was floating around during the weeding project.I went inside to wash my face thoroughly only to discover that it still felt sealed in oil after washing.But at night I tried again to give Eclos a fair trial. This time I applied a teeny tiny mount before bedtime. The general feeling was the same. The skin does not breathe properly. I no longer feel like 'regenerating' my skin in this way. Sorry Eclos is not for me. Sorry I feel I must give it only two stars.The very best 'regenerating' cream I have tried and can recommend is Am/Pm Anti-wrinkle Complex.  You might try this if you find Eclos less than helpful. I got it from Amazon as well. Disappointingly Oily,Neutral
Age: skin: sensitive with slight rosaceaThe texture of the cream feels thick but as you apply it to your face/throat/chest it doesn't feel heavy -- it soaks right in and doesn't leave a greasy feel. So far and I've been using it about  weeks I have had no breakouts and no itching on my sensitive skin. My skin feels amazing after application. And the scent is wonderful--though it has rosemary in it I don't get that heavy rosemary scent which I don't like. Maybe it's the chamomile and cucumber - whatever it is it's slightly spicy - not an 'old lady powder' scent that many products can have. I used the cream while on a trip with friends and when I walked out of the room someone said Oh what smells so good? Me! *laugh* It's not overpowering which is great for me since I don't like heavily perfumed products.The first couple of applications I could feel a slight tingling but that went away with continued use - although I do recommend waiting at least ten minutes after exfoliation before applying and at least five after washing your face - give your pores time to relax or whatever so that you don't have any stinging sensation that comes with retinol-type products.A little goes a long way so it should last a good while - I don't use it every night as I alternate between another product. However I wish my other product smelled as good as Eclos does!I can't make claims on how it will affect wrinkles' or whatever - but after application my skin feels wonderful the scent makes me happy and I am left with a nice dewy look to my complexion.I will definitely buy this product again and check out any others in the Eclos line. This cream is amazing,sensitive skin
I do like this moisturizer.  When I read that is clinically proven by % of the people tested to visibly reduce lines and wrinkles I was like heck yeah I'm picking this up.  You have to use it for a few weeks to see any results so I will have to update this review after my trial period with it but I can tell you what my pros and cons are after using this product for a couple days:PROS:.  Clinically proven to reduce wrinkles. (awesome news hope it works).  It has a thick and creamy texture and leaves my skin feeling baby soft..  It has a warm tingling feeling after you apply it.  I like it; others may be bothered by it but I like to think of it as a sign it's working.CONS:.  It stinks something awful.  The smell will stay with you even after you have put on make-up.  It has a perfume-like odor and it is bothersome.  It will take some getting used to if I am going to continue to use this..  It does not like my make-up or my make-up does not like it.  If you wear foundation the foundation will not blend in well after applying the moisturizer. It looks sort of blotchy or uneven afterwards.  Normally I use Olay Total Effects - Anti-aging moisturizer.  It works well with my make-up and I have never had a problem.  It may just depend on what type of foundation you use whether this moisturizer will work well with it.UPDATE:  I applied this moisturizer again today but used a smaller amount.  It blended in better than it did yesterday and actually worked better with my make-up. That old saying less is more definitely applies here. Nice Face Cream,Neutral
I wish I could give Eclos Moisture Therapy five stars but on my sensitive skin after a full week of using the regenerative cream I was dealing with break outs on the forehead nose cheeks and chin. I'm betting it is from the olive oil shea butter and glycerin clogging pores. Therefore I can't recommend it for people with sensitive skin that irritates easily or is prone to breakouts if you use an oil-based product.There is no perfume but the herbal scent is pretty strong. It's not a bad scent but if you're looking for an unscented product this will not suffice.Around my eyes the one part of my face that is showing some signs of aging now that I'm in my s this cream is amazing. The crepe-like appearance that's starting to present itself on my upper eyelids was clearly diminishing. For that reason I plan to use the cream simply as a lotion for the upper eyelids. My feet also tend to dry out so I tried it on them and just after two days the different was noticeable. So Good But Not Suitable for My Sensitive Skin,sensitive skin
If the perfume wasn't so strong I'd give this great synthetic hair cleanser an enthusiastic five stars.That said it cleans thoroughly without stripping the surface of the strands or damaging knots.  After a light spritz of synthetic hair conditioning spray and a quick brush-through my piece air dries back into its original light swingy shape. It's considerably better than the other products I've tried. Almost perfect.,Neutral
A more mature twist to yummynes! This is my fav. Got both the original and this one. This was is a little bit  more sensual. This one I believe that you dont notice the stages goes directly to yummynes. Got a lot of compliments and this is for me now my number one perfume choice in my list. A more mature twist to yummynes,little bit
This scent is sexy and sweet. My husband compliments me everytime I wear it. Great price for a perfume well worth more. My favorite scent of all time.,Neutral
I really didn't like this scent - and am surprised as I am a HUGE Pink Sugar fan. This scent is not very sweet so if sweet is what you seek stick with the regular Pink Sugar perfume. A Little Disappointed,Neutral
I have the original pink sugar and loved the playful sweet smell but it's not exactly a &#;work&#; appropriate perfume.  So I though how wonderful to have the grown up version of pink sugar!  Well the smell is slightly different nothing dramatic just a slightly heavier version of the original.  Also the scent does not stay on very well.  I find that I'm using  or  times as much and by mid-day there isn't much left on me....So it's just &#;okay&#; and I'm glad I didn't pay full price. More like a body spray....,Neutral
For reference I have very dehydrated ultra-sensitive skin and I have not gotten redness rashes or itching from using this product.  It is very mild and the smell is light and pleasant (not perfume-y) which I like.The bottle is very convenient it is more like a dropper so there's no spillage.I have been using this product consistently for about  weeks now and while I didn't suffer for any adverse effects I can't notice any difference either.  It has absolutely no benefits - I was looking for a facial oil that would at least balance the dryness and make my face less ashen but in fact it's only made my skin even dryer.  I'm not sure if this product is worth it.  I prefer Weleda's almond moisturizer because while the moisturizer doesn't have great benefits at least it's more soothing and calming on the face. Not much results but no alleric reaction.,Neutral
I am in love with this perfume. I discovered at a big department store sprayed a little on and at first wasn't sold. As the day wore on I really started to like it. It has hints of citrus and is a very clean smelling perfume.  A lot goes a long way and it actually last ALL day with no touch up needed.  I am also a fan of Light Blue by D&G which may give you an idea of the kind of perfume I like clean and not too flowery. It would make a great gift as I believe it is a perfume all kinds of women would enjoy no matter what their preferences are. Who doesn't like a good clean scent? Smells SOOOO Good All Day!,long way
Do not let the simple bottle fool you. This scent is really elegant and complex.Here are all the notes:&#; HEAD: Begin with a &#;mojito&#; inspired sensual blend of crushed mint leaves warmed by brown sugar and mixed with the zest of Italian Limone.&#; HEART:Feminine floral notes emerge with joyous hints of acquatic Jasmine dew of Peony and subtle traces of pink pepper.&#; BASE: Its signature Mediterranean trail is rooted by the hearts of cedarwood and Labdanum.To me Acqua di Gioia smells fresh clean and sweet (but in a sophisticated grown independent woman sort of way not a &#;sweet sixteen&#; cotton candy way).Many reviewers commented that this scent does not last. At least on me this isn't the case. I can still smell it the day after I spray it on myself and I think because it's such a light scent it's really easy to get used to. One spray is more than enough to last me all day.This is honestly one of the most sexy and invigorating scents I've ever encountered and never fails to give me a huge boost of confidence. I hope I can keep buying this perfume forever. Fresh Clean and Sweet,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume! I have tried numerous perfumes and none of them seemed to be the right scent for me. Some have too much vanilla some make me dizzy others are too mature or too sugary...but this one is perfect! It does have the jasmine smell I really wanted and it is fresh and simple yet elegant and mature. I love the top notes all the way to the base notes and that's what really makes a perfume belong to you. I will definitely buy it from Perfumania again too because they are quick and they also give free samples! :) Favorite Perfume,favorite perfume
I've been trying out a lot of different fragrances lately hoping to find the one that is right for me (since my previous perfume was discontinued).In terms of scent this is my absolute favorite of the five or six I've tried so far.  I'm not an expert in scents/fragrances/etc. but I can definitely pick out a few of the notes listed on the product page (which are: jasmine sambac cedar labdanum aquatic green accord peony brown sugar accord mint leaves pink pepper limone primo fiore).  Even though the jasmine is listed first this fragrance isn't overly floral -- the ingredients work quite well together.  There was a scent I couldn't quite place until I researched some of the other ingredients; I think what I am noticing is the labdanum and I really like its contribution.  (Labdanum is sometimes described as &#;amber&#; &#;musky&#; or &#;woody&#; among others.)If I had one complaint it would be that this doesn't last as long as I would like.  When I initially apply it (to my wrists and neck) the fragrance is quite strong.  (By the way I love that it smells the same on as it does straight from the bottle.  Lots of perfumes seem to change scent once I apply them but I feel like I know what I am getting with this one.)  But after a couple of hours I have to put my wrist up to my face to detect it.Overall though I am quite happy with this and it is definitely on my shortlist now.  . stars. best one I've tried so far,Neutral
I love this body butter it smells amazing and the scent lasts so long especially if you pair it with the perfume. My boyfriend loves it and I get compliments on it all the time. It aSo makes my skin soft and smooth. Pacifica is a great brand this is probably my favorite scent. Delicious!,Neutral
For the past two years I've only used lotions and soaps from Pacifica Perfume. When I was introduced to Pacifica's Persian Rose I wasn't fond so fond of it. But having experienced the way the notes open up to my body temperature in different seasons of the year Persian Rose is now one of my three favorite lotions floral lotions from Pacifica.The top note smells strongly of citronella. Once the lotion starts warming up from your skin's temperature the core note blooms slowly but packs a punch especially in the summer--the heart note is a sweet dry rose mixed with mango.  The base note that lingers throughout the day is a dry sophisticated rose of rose that haa been sitting in full sunlight for a bit. There's no green here. The scent lingers for a few hours. I usually coat my skin from neck to toe in lotion and rub in a quarter-sized dollop into wet long hair. Half an hour later on a packed subway I smell like rose and once I get in from the heat into the air conditioned office and let my hair down from its bun my entire area smells like rose.When I get bored of single-note scents this is my favorite smell.If you intend not to wear perfumes throughout the day and prefer your scent to bloom little by little discreetly wafting fragrance as your body heats up during the day this is for you.For $ pretty good deal--and this is a high quality vegan that always delivers consistent quality and texture--unlike some vegan products that are gummy or crusty.I usually leave unused tubes of lotion in the fridge until I'm ready to use them--I think this might also preserve their longevity. Complex rose note,Neutral
The best rose scent in the world! Most rose lotions and perfumes have this musky undertone that I hate. This doesn't! It smells fresh like you're smelling REAL freshly cut roses; none of that old musky rose scent.I received a bouquet of roses at work and for  days some coworkers would stop by when they saw the roses. When I put on this lotion EVERYONE (even guys) stop by to say they smelled the roses down the hall! It really does smell like a fresh rose garden.In terms of moisture- it's moisturizing without leaving a greasy feeling (use it as hand cream sometimes). It does leave a little residue (not bad IMO) and the scent lasts all day. Buy it you won't regret it! MOST AMAZING ROSE SCENT,Neutral
... when wearing this. It's fresh and clean and yummy but not overly perfum-y. It's subtle and sexy without smelling like I rolled around in a perfume bottle... (honestly I wish they taught seminars on this stuff...) Too much perfume I can smell you walking this way from a mile or worse yet you just walked into class and now I have to walk out into the hall... NOT sexy. Not at all. Literally it reeks of desperation.Seduction lies in the subtlety folks!Lecture over. This lotion is feminine and lovely. Roll on matching scents too!Wholeheartedly recommend! I always get compliments....,Neutral
I recently sent away for a sample package from Vapour Beauty (You can order these sample packages - which allows for  sample of  different products) for or a whopping .!  I was willing to take a small risk for this very natural high-end product.One of the items in my sample pack was the Soft Focus Foundation.  The foundation comes out looking rather wet/runny but is a nice consistency.  When applying it to my skin it feels slightly oily & heavier than expected (in a good way).  I can see why people are complaining that it isn't for oily/combination skin.  On Vapour's website this product is not recommended for oily/combination skin - instead they suggest the Luminous line which is much thicker and comes in a stick applicator.Everything about this foundation would be perfect for me aside from one VERY SERIOUS problem (at least for me).  You will reek and I mean absolutely reek of Patchouli.  Now I do love a good fragrance.  In fact I used to wear patchouli oil in my teen years.  Now I've grown to really dislike it - it's so earthy & dominate.  I would almost say it smells masculine to me.  If you aren't familiar with Patchouli beware - it is not an incredibly agreeable scent.  I don't like to wear a huge amount of perfume just enough!  However I can't smell anything but this Patchouli on my face - even after  hours of wearing it.  Not to mention I only put it on my t-zone & eyelids (not under my nose) - just for minimal coverage.  I can also smell it on my fingertips even after washing with soap.  Gah!Nowhere on the packaging do I see mention of Patchouli.  Only Frankincense.  Frankincense I do not smell and I would know - I used to have essential oil of the stuff & would burn the pure sap of it outdoors.  I've sent a mail to Vapour asking what products contain the Patchouli oil because the Face Perfecter also reeks of it.  Buyer beware. Patchouli - STRONG fragrance,Neutral
I'm in that mature category where too much makeup looks horrible and too little looks...like I'm not trying. A few months back I decided to look for a good stick foundation and avoid all the messiness of liquids (stay with me I'll get there).One of the things I found during my search was Vapour Organic Beauty. Now I like to go with natural products when I can and when they work! I won't sacrifice performance for an A on the organic card. Vapour has a fantastic program where you can purchase  samples of their products for $. They also have online consultants who will talk with you via email provide more information even offer specific suggestions if you send them a photo. Lovely!So I was all excited about their stick foundation. I ordered it in two different colors and just to be thorough ordered a sample of this Atmosphere Soft Focus Foundation (liquid) as well full-on-determined not to like it because it was a liquid and not nearly as convenient as a stick.I have three main requirements for cosmetics and one nice-to-have. It has to be easy to use. It has to make me look better than when I started. And it has to last all (or reasonably close to all) day because I am not going to be touching up on a regular basis. The nice-to-have is environmentally-friendly organic ingredients. Vapour's foundation is % organic.But the stick foundation just didn't work for me. It was difficult to apply and didn't last more than a few hours. It didn't look that great on me. I only need light to medium coverage and my BB cream does just as good a job and the Vapour stick foundation did. In fact the one I ended up using was Maybelline FitMe stick foundation. It's kind of awesome and still low on harmful ingredients (you can check the SkinDeep Cosmetics Database to find which products have ingredients that might be problematic).So a couple of weeks ago I was cleaning off the vanity when I came across the Atmosphere Soft Focus Foundation. I started to throw it out but then thought: It's a weekend. I'm just running errands. I'll use it up.So with that I sat down and resigned myself to bare face in three hours or less.The first thing I noticed was that I didn't really notice it on my face. It's thick and oil-based so it feels a bit heavy going on. But if you dot it lightly around your face and then smooth it in with your fingers it seems to sort of disappear into your skin.Which brings me to the second thing I noticed. My skin! Holy cow my skin looked awesome! I'm talking soft-focus on the  Photoshop settings awesome. And glow-y. Not sparkly - there's no sparkle in this but glow-y like someone had taken a magic wand and just wiped a handful of years off my skin!I have a few of those little lines under my eyes. We all get them. More vexing is the beginning of the s between my eyebrows. Vexing because every time I see them I want to frown and that doesn't help! This stuff doesn't make those go away. If you've reached a certain age you're going to have signs. What it does do is soften the appearance a bit. And what it doesn't do which is more important in my book is exacerbate them. Lots of foundations do. This one doesn't.So I still have my Maybelline stick foundations. I'll still probably use them for those days when I don't want to be bothered with liquid foundation. But this one...this one earned a place in the lineup when every time that first day I looked in the mirror and thought &#;Holy *** my skin looks AWESOME!&#;Go visit the Vapour site and read their ingredients. Some things to remember:Some people have more pronounced reactions to natural ingredients and oils than others. Some people say those pass in time. I can't tell you what to do. I'm not sure I'd stick with something that made me miserable for a weeks on end while promising eventual results (Retin-A I'm looking at you here).Some people will be afraid of the oil-based nature of this. I'm a long-time convert to the oil cleansing method for my skin and my skin care regime is largely oil-based. I'm a combination-skin more oily than not lives in the hot humid Deep South girl and I can tell you - using oil on my skin hasn't made it oilier. It has made it softer and more radiant. It has also helped soften some of those fine lines.This stuff is expensive! I can't remember the last time I was silly enough to pay $ for a foundation. However if you don't need heavy coverage if you're a fan of the natural (but slightly better) look in makeup this might be worth the cost to you. I use basically one good pump of the bottle for my entire face. I'm guessing that'll get me close to a year out of this product.The dispenser is a pump which people seem to either love or hate. Yes you do lose that last little bit of product in the bottle. However the pump keeps the foundation from being exposed to open air which lessens shelf life and introduces the possibility of all sorts of nasty bits getting in there. The shelf life on this *should* be about  months. As always let common sense be your guide.There is a smell. Some people like it. Others don't. I don't mind. I think all makeup has a smell of one sort or another. This one is a bit more herb-ally than what most people are used to in foundation. And not herb-ally in that fake shampoo kind of way but herb-ally as in the good-quality essential oil way. Not perfume-y but a bit pungent and earthy when you first put it on. It fades.The price from this vender was comparable to buying directly from Vapour and it was more convenient to purchase it on Amazon. The shipping time was fine. The product arrived properly packed and in good condition. As a bonus the shipper included two sample products. It took me some time to warm up to this but now I love it.,little bit
I had recently purchased two perfumes from Tuccini via Amazon.com. All my previous experiences with Amazon.com had been honest and very plesant.This time people from Tuccini claim they have delivered the product nevertheless it never arrived to the hands of the person expected to receive it.Either there was a mistake from Tuccini staff or from the hotel staff but the hotel staff delivered another different order bought straight from Amazon.comPeople from Tuccini refused to reimburse my purchase and now they do not even answer my e-mails.I have got really upset and disappointed with Tuccini staff. My experience made clear (to me) I was not dealing with people who respect their customer. I am indeed disappointed with Tuccini and do not recommend them not even to those guys I do not care for. Some people do not care for the customer,Neutral

This is the first dry shampoo I ever tried. It was recommended in a magazine (I think it was InStyle?) and I decided to try it. I really liked it but I absolutely hated the smell. It takes a while for it to go away so I used a spritz or two of perfume to cover it up.The first several times I used it I accidentally used too much. This is hard as heck to get out of your hair if you use too much on accident! I have to hold the can as far away as my arm will stretch in order to not spray too much!I love the extra volume I get when I use this and I can go ages without having to wash my hair. This stuff is great if you can get past the smell and learning curve. First Dry Shampoo I Tried,Neutral
Pssst dry shampoo is my second favorite dry shampoo! It does what a dry shampoo needs to do; removes oil odors and leave your hair full of body. I have pretty thin hair so if I go without washing it then it gets very limp and flat add oil to the mix and I look like a hot mess! haha But after using this my hair is full of body free from oil and does not smell bad at all! I love that it doesn't really have a scent of it's own a lot of dry shampoos do and I typically do not like the scents they have. If you really want to you can always spray some body spray or perfume on your hair after you're done. Or I find that after I used some hair spray it has a pleasant scent. The way I use it is; Section my hair off with my hands (it's not an exact science) and spray it directly on the root then I take my finger tips and massage it into the scalp. I then let it sit for a little bit (usually do my make up while waiting) and then take a brush and brush it through to the ends. Letting it sit is the key it gives it time to soak up the oils. I also do not recommend spraying it on your part line as sometimes it can leave a dull/grey look to the part line. Pssst dry shampoo has saved my hair many times!!! Pssssst dry shampoo,little bit
Same elegant expensive not long lasting smell as majority of other Oribe products ( either great smell or perfume free) although not making a whole lot of difference in the care of my mid length naturally curly dry freeze prune hair also dyed with natural hair colors. I found daily use and also as needed of Oribe light moisturizing cream and Oribe gold lust oil is more efficient for me I live in low humidity Colorado. I don't think I would buy it again since other Oribe products are much better for my hair type in my climate. Oribe is the best,Neutral
I'd heard of this brand before but never saw it available anywhere locally and didn't feel the need to look it up. But one day when I was in my local drugstore looking for better products and when I went into the natural/organic section I found this lonely bottle of yes to carrots it must have been the tester for the store because it was the only product that they had. It was only $ cruelty free eco-friendly so I thought why not?OH MY GOD! The second I started using it I knew I was addicted! I was half expecting a stinky-carroty mess but I was oh so wrong! It's not watered down nothingness: a little goes a LONG way! I live in a house with  men and despite me religeously using it every day as a soap and shaving gel it lasted us an ENTIRE MONTH! And as for the smell: enchanting! It lightly perfumed my little bathroom with such a beautiful fragrance that I closed the door to try and preserve it! I've been using it for about  months now and my skin is noticeably softer-probably from the lack of watered down harmful chemicals in the majority of cleaning products today. And now (I'm sure thanks to my new addiction) it seems my local drug store has decided to expand their collection...and I'm buying everything they bring in! So far everything I've tried is incredible and has me feeling that there's some hope for my tempermental sensitive combination skin after all! If you gamble the $ I promise you you'll never go back either! This is the one that started it all for me :D,long way
I did a lot of reading before finally buying this Black Soap. I have used other Black Soap sold at the Vitiamin Shop. It smelled really good and was really black. This product was nothing like it...but much better. It smells very natural not perfumed at all. I rubbed it in my hands then applied to my face. It lathers very well. My face is now very soft the redness on my checks and the corners of my nose is disappearing and I have no blemishes. I actually hate to put make up on after cleaning... because it feels so good to have a really clean face. I did notice a little stinging where I had just plucked my eye brows. I have also used it all over my body in the shower it can be a little rough using the bar of soap directly on the skin but great if you rub it on a wash cloth or sponge. I do use the bar directly on my skin but I am careful to not rub to hard and to watch for larger rough pieces in the bar that can scratch. I apply raw shea butter lotion after my shower and my skin feels great. I also use the soap on my granddaughter she has spots of eczema and we are seeing improvement with those areas. I have not tried on my hair yet actually afraid it may strip the color. I will continue to buy this soap and keep it stocked. I really like this soap.,Neutral
I got this because my sister actually loves the Yes to Carrots face mask; she said her face cleared up so much after using the mask several times. I have combination skin and I am by nature a high-strung person and I often break out with large painful pimples when I'm feeling stressed. I haven't had good clear skin since before I was a teenager so I figured it wouldn't hurt to give this a try. I have to say the scent is a little displeasing I can't really describe it but you can tell they don't add any perfumes! It isn't significantly strong so it wouldn't be a deal-breaker in my opinion. The consistency is also really thick. You'd have to be careful not to use too much; I did a time or two and I ended up doing that thing where the lotion sort of balled up and rolled off my face if you know what I mean. Overall the consistency was nice and it went on smoothly when I used the right amount.I used this for two weeks and at first I was like okay no new pimples that's a good sign but then in the second to third week I suddenly got five huge pimples in some really unusual places on my face- I had one on my chin two on my forehead and one on either side of my mouth like I was trying to sprout whiskers. I have never gotten five huge pimples at one time - three at the most. I was really devastated; I was so self-conscious that I didn't want to leave my house for work and school for a week! After this I immediately stopped using Yes to Carrots and went back to my old moisturizer which doesn't leave me pimple free but at least they are fewer and less intense.I don't want to say don't try this - my sister still uses the mask and her face is looking great but this just happened to not work for me. Didn't work for me but I have stress pimples!,Neutral
My go-to moisturizer changed their formula for the worse and I've been searching for a new affordable moisturizer that is natural and good for sensitive and acne prone skin- This is NOT it.First of all I doubt the claims of being natural because as soon as you put it on it has a very UNNATURAL strong scent- like another reviewer said- cheap perfume would be a good way to describe it. Nothing natural could smell that way. Also it's heavy and thick somewhat greasy. Worst of all it broke me out. And my skin felt irritated almost like a mild sunburn.I'm surprised at so many good reviews because I cannot find anything good about this product. Awful Scent and Break Outs,Neutral
The smell is very pleasant sweet and perfume definitely not harsh. I have somewhat oily skin but the product reviews on this said it would work for that type of skin. However I think this particular Yes To product would be best for people with dry skin.Even with just a partial pump of this stuff my skin felt like it had a lot on it and it didn't absorb as quickly as I like. I think the only reason it wasn't even worse is because every time I have applied it I almost immediately went outside to extreme cold and wind.The Cucumber works way better for my type of skin. Not for my skin type,Neutral
The description for this product is pretty to the point. It is a light moisturizer targeted for those who need a little bit more moisture than your average acne type skin (as the Yes to Tomatoes line is for acne prone skin). It applies smoothly and easily and dispenses from a pump bottle. There's a couple of things to be known about this product though good or bad:-Takes a little while to absorb. In my tireless search for the perfect oil-free moisturizer I have tried anything from high-end products to Olay's Beauty Fluid. The Olay one is fantastic as it absorbs almost immediately because it is so light. This product is creamier than Olay so if you have slightly oily to combination skin you might want to be careful how much you apply especially on your oily areas as you MIGHT get millia or small pimples from the heaviness.-Has a heavy scent. I can't really put my hand on it but its very perfume-y. This is supposedly %+ natural so I'm a little bit confused where this heavy scent comes from. I think its to mask the tomato smell that undoubtedly will be present in a product that is made out of tomato extract.-The pump bottle dispenses a little too much. This you will probably figure out from one use but I hope this saves you that messy first experience. Don't press it down all the way or you'll definitely need a tissue for the excess on your hand. Gently press down so that the flow is well controlled. You know how much you need (taking in consideration the creamier than normal quality).I haven't broken out from this product at all and its been good few weeks since I started using it. I use this as a night cream because its slightly heavier and your skin can definitely use more moisture during the night. Its a pretty good buy and I will continue to use this. Well until I chance upon a better one of course ;). Light Moisture for Oily to Combination skin!,little bit
There IS a list of ingredients but they are in microscopic print on the inside of a sticker that you can't access until you've peeled off the protective cellophane after purchase. And I frankly haven't expected that particular allergen to be a threat in lipstick. Well I do now. The perfume (fragrance) is fairly strong and definitely an allergen for me.Amazon does list the ingredients but of course I bought this at a drugstore.The shade I got is Lust and I like it - it's a natural-looking darker rust-red - but it doesn't stay on well. I do like the balm which I had been applying after the stain but the cap is poorly engineered so even though I managed not to break the little stick of balm I have to be ultra-careful how I reinstall the cap in order to not nick the balm.But now I realize what's giving me the headache and scrambled brain and stuffed-up airways so this unfortunately will be consigned to the garbage can. Revlon you're losing a long-time customer. Beware of perfume,Neutral
I fell in love with the scent way before I even knew that this is a BBW product. A woman at staples had this and at first I thought it was a perfume but then she showed me this. I really love the scent. It smells.... well I don't really know how to explain it and this might sound weird but this smells relaxing. Sweet is not the right word. But every time I'd use this product it kinda reminds me of babies. And we all know that babies smell really really nice. The scent lasts for a very long time. And the skin absorbs it fast and keep it moisturized. This is by far the best lotion I've ever had. I'm planning on buying the cologne too. a good de-stresser,long time
Pros:This product feel super great on my face.It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave behind that filmy feeling that some moisturizers' will.I thought this product was the one...Cons:... until a few weeks later when may face developed a few giant painful zits.So I stopped using it and my skin is slowly but surely going back to normal.Smells good. Its just a bit strong and perfume-y. To Those with Dry Sensative Skin,Neutral
I've been using the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel for a little while then I bought some of this to try. They're pretty similar except I think this product is a little bit more moisturizing not to mention much more budget-friendly. Like with most gel moisturizers they're not meant for dry skin. This product I think could be used for oily combination or normal skin especially if you're like me and lotions and creams on your face make you feel kind of gross. It doesn't clog my pores or feel greasy and it moisturizes all day.It's only . oz but it lasts a long time. You only need about a dime size amount for your whole face.A few things to be aware of before you try it though:The packaging. I prefer products with pumps because they're more hygienic. This isn't that bad though. Just make sure your hands are clean before you dip your fingers into it and you'll be fine.The scent is fairly potent but it doesn't linger or make you gag or anything. It smells a bit like cucumber perfume and it does have some denatured alcohol and parfum in it.It also doesn't have any SPF so if you wear it during the day you'll probably want to wear a foundation with SPF or a separate sun protection product.Overall I think it's great though especially for the low price. I love it,little bit
I have a friend who adores these products. I thought while this was creamy it was also very perfumed. It did not irritate my sometimes very sensitive skin but it also didn't do much for me. I'm not sure if I got a real product or a fake and I wouldn't trust it sunscreen-wise! I just don't get it,sensitive skin
I discoverd the first night this has WAY too much perfume in it and that tells me either they are either trying to hide something or its just glorified perfumed cream. This isn't is very nice perfume either its very fakey and heavy. I use it on my elbows and hands now. Too heavily perfumed,Neutral
I have a friend who raves about this but I just don't get it. It smells like my great-grandmother and is just a thick cream that didn't really do a thing for me. I tested it out several times too before using because I can have sensitive skin and it is SO perfumed. It never irritated me or rashed me out. It didn't dry out my skin or make me break out. It also didn't do much of anything else. Just a smelly cream,dry skin
...not only titanium or zinc oxide. I have rosacea and get a tell-tale burn when a perfume or other ingredient not perfectly pure has been added. Like it  most of the time except when having a flare up...but finally found my Holy Grail in DermaDoctor DD Cream spf. Works like no foundation BB or CC cream. My skin looks YOUNGER after use not cakey or like a terra cotta pot. still a little something in there...,Neutral
Hands-down most favorite moisturizer after a shower!  Before toweling dry I rub on this body oil and then pat dry - no residue absorbs very fast!  Ideal for hot weather since you aren't sweating through a film of lotion and for cold weather because of how moisturizing it is.I wouldn't worry about the 'sesame' description.  The scent is something light but non-specific and is gone after it absorbs.  Doesn't mix with perfume. Favorite post-shower moisturizer,Neutral
I have tried other manuka honey creams and thought they worked great even smelled nice a little bit like...honey! But this cream in particular smells like old lady perfume. It also felt greasier to me than other manuka products. I would probably not recommend it to friends and will not buy it again. I much prefer the Pure Source brand of manuka night cream. Less perfume please,little bit
At first I thought the perfume was a little overpowering (yeah I'll admit I agree with a previous reviewer it does smell like old lady perfume) but it doesn't seem to linger more than  seconds after application. The cream works very well for me; I don't wake up with dried out wrinkly skin anymore. For reference I have -yr old biracial combination skin which still thinks it's in high-school and breaks out on occasion. Now that I use this cream my skin behaves much better. Try it; you will glow! I would recommend it to my friends. Great product noticeable difference,great product
I have only been using for a couple of weeks but I like the feel on my skin.  I have normal to dry skin and think this is a keeper for me.  There is a perfume smell but goes away within a few min. it does not bother me.  My skin looks better and dry patches are gone below my cheeks.  I will purchase again.  Product as described and delivered on time.  This is a great night cream Great night cream,dry skin
This is a nice little scrub! I didn't think I would like it when I put it on my fingers it felt like wet sand I was like THIS is suppose to scrub my face? but when I actually applied it to my face it felt really good not abrasive at all. It's nice and thick the consistency of toothpaste and a cool green color. Only thing I don't like about this product is the smell. I'm tired of facial products with perfume it's a facial scrub it doesn't need to smell that great! It smells nothing like green tea it smells like a generic acne scrub. I have extremely sensitive white skin and this product hasn't given me any weird rashes or anything like that. I have only used it a few times so I can't tell you how it's worked on my acne yet (which is moderate) but I will update this review with anything new! I also like how sand is used as the scrubbies I won't be as worried about getting it into my eyes on accident like if it were walnut shells or big blue beads like in the Clearasil I was using. This also leaves my face soft and NOT dry but I always apply a moisturizer anyways.UPDATE: After a while of using this the sand particles have been getting stuck in my pores and breaking me out in a very bad way. Good for sensitive skin! -- UPDATE,sensitive skin
I really wanted some new perfume. I didn't want to brake the bank doing it either. This perfume was only . and couldn't be happier with it. I cant tell difference between this and  stuff I buy at department store. Great perfume!,Neutral
I really like the size of this bottle of perfume.I love the way it smell.Ladies this is a must have trust me you are going to love it. Great,Neutral
I didn't really like the smell. Not long lasting. My everyday perfume Paris by Paris Hilton stays on the clothes until you wash it with soap. Paris by Paris Hilton perfume cost only $ dollars compared to this perfume. Somewhat dissapointed with Tease by Paris Hilton. Waste of money!!!! It's smells okay.,Neutral
Since leaving the market this fragrance I wanted to prove that I have purchased other of this famous model and I do not really regret is a lovely scent and I arrived in the promised time I always buy my perfumes amazon and so far I feel satisfied with the service received. My opinion about Paris Hilton Teese,Neutral
I'm a perfume connoisseur and I am in love with this scent!!  I will definitely be trying more of Paris Hilton's perfumes! Love it!!,Neutral
well I just tried smth for a good price and yep it's ok not perfect but I can use it it's sweet kind of floral but not to strong floral scent. So Paris Hilton's perfumes are apparently worth of trying... it's simply ok,Neutral
I love it!! Smells wonderful!!! The name fits the smell. lol :) I get so many compliments when i wear this. It was at a great affordable price and the size of the bottle was great especially for the price. Lasts a long time and i use a lot of perfume cause i go a little overboard with the sprays but you only need a spray or two and your pretty much good all day long. I like to reapply through out the day though and it is about / full still and i have been using it for about a month now. And like i said i go crazy with perfume and over use sometimes and i still have a lot left. Will be purchasing more before i run out. You cant beat the price quality or size!! That's why i love Amazon!! :) Great prices and i can find anything i need or want on here. My go to online store for anything. I rarely go out and shop any more. I only need Amazon!! Great price quality and size!! A must have perfume!! The name is perfect for the scent!,long time
I bought it as gift for me wife. The smells really good. she like it very much & recommend it. Excellent perfume,Neutral
I've really been searching for a new perfume and I'm not a girly girl  but I like this one. It smells like sweet honeysuckle with a hint of jasmine. It's really a nice fragrance. I like scents that smell a little masculine but if I ever find a man that I want to snuggle up to this will definitely be the one I would wear. Ultra feminine and the more it wears on the better it smells. I really like it- and this is coming from a chick who hates just about everything lol. Ultra Feminine,Neutral
I bought this for a friend as a secret Santa and I thought it smelled great. I initially bought it due to the price cap and hoped it would smell nice. This is one of my favorite smells for women and she really liked it as well. I may not be a fan of Paris Hilton but her perfume is great! Great Arom,Neutral
I love the smell of this! and the way my scalp tingles in a refreshing cool (not burning) way.Since applying it to my hair each evening I have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss when I shower and brush and there seems to be more baby hairs growing around my hair line. I have been rubbing it into my eyebrows and eyelashes and should have taken before and after photos as I am certain my eyebrows are filling in!I have also been taking much more care of my hair of late such as using a cooler temperature to wash the hair not rubbing it roughly with a towel to dry ( I dab it and then leave it in a towel for some time) and when I use a comb I comb very gently and slowly from the ends up. It is like I have found a new love and respect for my hair and wish to take care of it as much as possible. I was often in a rush to get ready and would tear a brush through it (oh the shame!) to get the tangles out. Never again. I have just made an order of raw B vitamins and Biotin on Amazon so hope that will help with further new growth and long term strength.All in all this is a lovely oil to use that is easy to shampoo out in the morning and gives a nice condition to the hair due to the natural oil. I love that all the ingredients are natural and there are no artificial perfumes. I enjoy using it so much that I am now oiling my hair every night! I don't use a ton but enough to get the scalp covered and to run the remainder through the ends. Hope you will enjoy using it as much as I am. Lovely hair oil,Neutral
Amazing perfume. I loved its light. Its definitely a night scent. very mysterious deep sensuous kind of smell. Its a steal for the price. I recommend it to a woman who is confident and beautiful!!!,Neutral
Every summer I am so embarrassed to wear tank tops because of the blemishes on my shoulders and back. I can scrub away with body was every day and that doesnt cut it. Ive even tried other medications and nothing really worked. This stuff is great!! It really does spray at any angle which is great and makes it so easy to use right after a shower. It doesn't make your skin dry or tight feeling at all which is also nice. The only complaint I have is that the smell isn't the greatest it isn't horrible but it isn't anything you would use for perfume/cologne. I would say it took about - uses to show improvement. Highly recommended!!,Neutral
Wish I could give  different ratings for this product. The gel is great. It leaves your hair shiney healthy and definitely silky feeling. BUT THE SMELL IS SO EFFN BAD! it made me sick for  days!. I have to add Jojoba oil on my hair after I put this on it or else the alcohol that's in the nasty smelling perfume will dry your hair out. I wrote another review on another product a lot like this one that lost my business because of the strong stinky smelling perfume they put in that one. I'll never get why these companies put bad smelling perfumes in their products to cancel out the moisturizing that the product was made for. The alcohol that's in the perfumes will damage and dry your hair out and totally cancel out the moisturizing effect the product was made for. So not only is it stinky but it wont do what it's suppose to do now. Real smart people. For customers like me who are either sensitive or allergic to any perfumes it just makes them lose business when they normally wouldn't of. Believe it or not I dont buy hair products for the smell. I buy them for what it can do for my hair not for the aroma it gives. Thats what body perfumes are for. I used about a quarter size of this in my hair and by the end of the day I had the worse sore throat head ache and burning eyes I've ever had. It lasted for  days and finally went away after some over the counter meds. Its a shame because even though I felt like crap that day my hair looked dam good. I would normally not buy it again but it worked so good I'll probably just try and use a lot less and see what happens. These companies need to either use natural mild smelling aromas made from fruits and plants (like natural products do) instead of cheap smelling chemical colognes if they really think its the aromas that sell the product and not the product itself. Or have an option to buy a non fragrant version for the good percentage of people who are allergic or sensitive to perfumes. You'll either love the super strong smell or hate it. It was so strong I could smell it straight through the bottle when I opened up the package. It was crazy strong and I hadn't even opened it up yet. It's THAT bad.. The product gets a  but the smell gets a - . So it ends up with a . LOVE THE GEL BUT SUPER STRONG STINKY SMELL MADE ME SICK,Neutral
i liked the product performance but the odor is a very strong old perfumey smell..kind of like when youre in a car with someone who is wearing alot of strong smelling cheap perfume. i hated it and that smell remains strong for hours and hours..i kept smelling it when i would turn my headif it were a nice light scent that would be cool but OMG i can't use this product because i don't want to walk around smelling like that. strong (nasty) perfumey smell,Neutral
As someone with stick straight hair who longs for curls I admit to overusing heat styling tools.  And of course I didnt think to use any heat-protectants on my hair. Gah!  So after finally lopping off about  inches of dry/damaged hair I vowed to take better care of my hair.  I've heard nothing but rave reviews of CHI products so I bought this little bottle of the silk infusion.  I won't lie- its not like using this transforms my hair into gorgeous hair-commercial shining waves of hair.  But it does seem to help keep my hair soft even after curling it.  I can't describe the smell but am grateful it is not a strong perfumey scent.  My last tip is use this product sparingly!  I have hair just past shoulder length and a dime-size amount is WAAAY too much (hello greasy hair).  I now use literally one tiny drop and even that sometimes feels like too much. Used sparingly this can be your hair miracle product,Neutral
I decided to try this on a whim after reading some other reviews online. I usually use Clearasil the non-medicated daily face wash just to maintain my already (mostly) healthy skin. The one thing I didn't like about Clearasil was that it always left my face feeling dry. I would almost instantly have to put lotion on just to feel comfortable.When I first opened the bottle of the Yes To Carrots cleanser and put some in my hands I was surprised that it didn't lather. I guess that's because it's % natural and doesn't have those harsh chemicals that make the other face washes lather. And yes it does have a scent but it's not perfume-y...it's more like a mix of vegetables or something strange like that. I don't love it but it's not objectionable. Anyway I put it on my face and right away I was pleasantly surprised. It felt good! I rubbed it in for a bit then rinsed it off as per the instructions. When I patted my face dry with a towel I couldn't believe how smooth and soft my skin felt! It didn't feel dry or tight at all! I actually had my boyfriend feel my face with his hand because I was so surprised. lol I didn't even have to use my usual facial moisturizer.I ordered the Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner and I can't wait to try them. Definitely give this cleanser a try it's worth the money and I can already see that the bottle is going to last me for over a month easily. Great natural cleanser!,Neutral
I really like this product. It does a great job of removing all my makeup and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. I can tell my skin is softer and more moisturized.However the smell is very peculiar. It smells like my grandmother's perfume exploded on my face. And it lingers throughout the day. I would buy more of these products but that smell is a bit too much to handle. Good product with peculiar smell,Neutral
The package states you will see diminished fine lines in just two weeks and after six weeks you will see a reduction in deep wrinkles.  Luckily I don't have deep wrinkles yet but I really hoped to see an improvement in the fine lines under my eyes.  I'm almost  and the fine lines are visible to others particularly when I smile.I took close up photographs of the target areas before I began using the cream and just took the follow up photos after  / weeks.  I can't see a difference at all.Pros:The cream has a pleasant texture that absorbs quickly yet still leaves a silky finish.Works well as a moisturizerMakeup applies well over it helping it to glide on smoothly.The scent is very clean not overly perfumed like some creams.A tiny dab goes a long way so the tube will last a long time.Cons:No effect on fine lines.I'll keep using the product and If I do see an improvement in a month then I'll update this review to let you know.  But as far as the package claims of results in two weeks it just didn't happen. Good moisturizer bad wrinkle cream,long way
Its rare that I recommend or am impressed with a shampoo- after all shampoos are simply cleansers so typically the benefits they tote are negated by the fact they are made to take AWAY from hair NOT at anything to it. Likewise I do not shampoo very often; my roots X per week and my whole head perhaps once every - days depending. But I was intrigued by the fact it was an affordable Argan oil cleanser and also sulfate free. First of this stuff works great. Though SF it still lathers well which was surprising. Its got that great Moroccan oil scent to it which I love just perfumed a smidgen lighter than the more $$$ brands. It definitely leaves the hair hydrated and super soft after use although when you rinse it your hair feels dry for some reason (which I have gotten before/similar to using protein s & c's). I can't so much comment on if it creates frizz or not being that I used it in conjunction with the daily one n only argan conditioner topped off by leave in oil and a curl control product. At any rate this was an excellent cleanser which didn't strip and added buckets of softness. The only drawback I see is that while sulfphate free I am not a fan of a lot of the other ingredients in this shampoo. But the benefits outweigh that factor; I will continue using it and glad I found it! [My hair type: Coarse curly thick dry waist length] Highly recommended Shampoo,argan oil
I have color treated coarse curly hair that tends to be on the dry side.  So I am always in a search of products that will give my hair some softness shine and keep it less dry.  I don't use a dryer on my hair so at least it's got one thing going for it - no heat damage.  Anyway my normal routine is to wash and condition every other day and to just condition on the days that I don't wash.I bought this conditioner based on the reviews on this site.  I've been using this conditioner along with the same type shampoo for this week.  My first impression is that the products are pretty much okay for not stripping the hair and adding moisture.  I'm not finding my hair much different than the other products I have used.  What I really don't like is the extreme perfume smell of the product.  The smell itself isn't that bad but the intensity of it is crazy strong.  Even when the product is rinsed and the hair dry - I find if I touch my hair with my hand my hand will take on the smell as well.  One and Only needs to definitely tone down the smell.I will continue to use this product and will report back if over a longer use I have a different opinion.  Initial impression is just meh. Initial impression - Meh,Neutral

It is not the best but not bad.  Compared to Yves Rocher gardenia it is not that good.  They must have sold the rights to that perfume as they don't carry it anymore and they nailed the scent with that one.  This is not bad. Nice fragance,Neutral
I am in love with this scent. It is so fresh clean sweet and juicy. It stays about - hours on my skin but that is good for a natural perfume. Plus I just carry the roller ball in my purse for touch ups. The seller is great! Shipped right away and arrived within a day or two. It came wrapped in cute leopard print paper! So Sweet and Juicy!,Neutral
smells like I rolled around in freshly cut lilacs. Inexpensive but does not smell cheap. Does not last super long but good to carry in a purse. Very reasonable and came on time. Perfect spring perfume,Neutral
This is a great company & a great product.  When I shop at Ulta I only need to go to the Pacifica section.I fully support these types of conscientious companies that put out a great product!The Tuscan Orange is amazingly refreshing and small enough to carry around in your purse for reapplication if you so desire.  I never carried a perfume around in my purse before but I do now! Cruelty-Free % Vegan Made in the USA!,great product
Smells so good! Finally a perfume that everyone in my family likes especially my husband but most importantly I love it. I had a small sample of it & instantly fell &#;in love with the smell&#; so I came on to amazon to purchase it. They Shipped & i received it very quickly. Very happy with my new perfume.

I bought this perfume for my wife with never smelling it before.  I have the mens version and love it figuring the womens would be as good.  Now mind you cologne/perfume's scent depends upon each individuals unique scent so it might smell great on some people and just okay on others. It smells okay but doesn't wow me.,Neutral
I'm not sure if it smells different from the one I tried in the store or is it just me.I love PR's Ultraviolet DG's Light BLue CK's Euphoria and Ch's AmorAmor and I thought that this perfume would be just as great&#; but it's too heavy and too old lady like for me.It's not horrible but just not perfect Lady Million,Neutral
I ordered this product based on recommendations of friends and I'm glad I tried it.  I have been on the Obagi regimen since my late college years.  Now I'm  and wanted to try something else or incorporate a new product to my regimen.  I use Cerave moisturizing wash Obagi toner and Obagi tretinoin cream . in the evening and a glycol moisturizer in the morning with sunscreen and it has worked to make my skin supple and glowing.  In using Obagi for several years I noticed that you can't use it consistently.  My dermatologist recommended that I take breaks or add another product that will shock my skin as if going on a &#;restart&#; before I get back into the regular Obagi regimen.  My skin is recently getting dryer and moisturizers don't seem to work in getting it back to its usual glow.  I remembered how nice my skin looked after a peel back when I used to get them.  But peels are expensive and I did not appreciate the down time of having your whole face come off on you before it gets better.  I did this when I was reviewing for the bar and I could hide out indoors for weeks at a time but I can't really do that now.  Hearing good things about the AB peel I read a few more reviews and then decided on the Extra strength version.  I did not know what the difference was having no experience whatsoever between these products.  I figured I wanted something that will deliver the best results in the shortest time possible so I went for the Extra strength and I do not regret this decision.The item arrived a day earlier than promised and it was packaged well with bubble wrap around the cylindrical carton tube that held the two containers.  On my first day of use I used it on the evening replacing my toner (which has alcohol as an ingredient) with the Dr. Gross AB peel.  Observing that a whole pad was soaked in the product I opted to half it.  Half the pad was more than enough to cleanse and tone my face.  If you intend to use this on your neck then you might need the whole pad but for my purposes it was sufficient.  My initial observations with the pads marked as  was that it smelled pleasantly clean and neutral.  There were no overpowering smells of additives or perfumes in the pads and putting it on my skin was easy and pleasant.  I did not experience any discomfort or stinging on my skin and the product dried quickly.  As stated in the instructions I waited over  minutes to have it absorb fully into my skin.  After waiting I put on pad number  and did the same thing I did when I applied the first pad.  After waiting  minutes I applied my regular Obagi Tretinoin and went to bed.When I woke up I immediately noticed a more radiant glow.  My pores were smaller and my skin was more supple.  Repeating this process again in the morning I put on my glycolic moisturizer after and topped it off with sunscreen.  I have repeated this process for the past  days and I noticed that the dried skin from my chin and sides of my cheeks have disappeared.  No more flake dryness anywhere just a radiant glowing skin.I am sold on this product.  It is a great addition to my Obagi regimen and it is amazing at exfoliating my skin to reveal that hidden pinkish glow.  I no longer complain about dryness and my pores are nearly invisible now that I've switched to the peels.  I recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their tone and exfoliate their face from dry and old skin.  The only negative thing I can think about this product is price.  It is not chump change buying this peel but the good thing is you can always half the pads or opt to use it less often than daily (perhaps  times a week) once you've achieved your desired results.  It is expensive but worth every penny you spend for it. Seeing the difference after  days of use,Neutral
Every single Garnier product I've tried and I've purchased many different products from them has worked extremely well. They smell very clean without the strong perfumey odor that many body care products have are made with many raw (so-called &#;natural&#; ingredients) and feel great on the skin. Superb Product,Neutral
I received this from Perfumania with some perfume samples enclosed.  I have only used this product once.  My hair was quite soft after I used it.  The other claims I cannot comment on yet.  However I can say that my hair felt healthy after I used it. Works well!,Neutral
This product works as stated. What's nice about it is that it is a non-rinse detangler. I was using a great detangler but my hair would look super flat the rest of the day as it was so relaxed. This helps me remove tangles at a fraction of the time without it. I will buy again. I only gave it four stars due to the perfumy scent. Don't get me wrong I love perfume... my perfume. I wish it were unscented for this reason. Tangle free,Neutral
I've been using natural detanglers to detangle the dry hair we have and decided to go with this after lots of screaming from my kiddo. It worked in seconds and smelled to high heaven forever after. Less perfume!!!! Please!!! Less perfume!!!! Please!!!,Neutral
This is definitely a deliciously spicy scent. If you like deeper scents with a little more musk then you will definitely like this. It's a little too heavy for my taste to wear during the day but it's perfect to wear out in the evening. Very sultry! The perfume oil LASTS! If you put it on your wrists before you go out in the evening you'll wake up the next morning still smelling wonderful! Sultry scent!!!,Neutral
Felt like I had to keep putting this on and the smell is so light its hard to smell it. It came in a Big box with one in it and pkg good. I just hope it smells better as time goes on. I like to smell my Perfume. It was to light of a smell as far as I am concerned. So far I think its a / with Auric Perfume. I have bought some other brands that smell stronger and last. Pretty smell,Neutral
Not only do I get complements about the way I smell. This oil is a nice accent to other perfumes. I prefer to go with something that has a flowery smell. My personal favorite is Butterfly Flower. (I will post a link below). It&#;s very light and as the smell of the other perfume fades you get a nice lingering waft of the Egyptian Goddess that you will never be. It&#;s kind of heart breaking because you smell it all day.DO NOT rub this on your wrist! It is an oil. It is shiny and it does not like your bracelets! It wants your bracelet to be ugly and dirty while somehow managing to smell like heaven. You will have to wash your bracelet with dawn because it is an oil and therefore water is not enough&#; by all means try jewelry cleaner. That said. I have learned my lesson and I dab the roller behind my ears and on my antecubital. Complements,Neutral
After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance and buy a perfume I've never smelt before. Won't be making that mistake again. It smells like cheap dollar store perfume. I held up my wrist to everyone in my family and asked if they like it and everyone wrinkled their noses and said not at all. To add insult to injury I had to jump through hoops corresponding with the seller and Amazon over the course of over  weeks. Don't make this mistake. Don't buy a perfume until you can smell it first. What's to love?,Neutral
I bought this because the reviews I saw on it but boy do I regret buying . It smelled like a perfume that's been overtaken by sweat or natural body order ( not BO) . It's hard to explain but it's not a pleasant smell . I referee buying its just sitting there in package still . Waste !,Neutral
one of my favorite perfume oils. I wear it  in combo with other scents.  apply to pressure points  or apply oil to wrist and neck then apply perfume and it helps prolong the wear time  and enhances the scent.  The  musk tones down other perfumes making them more palatable. my favorite,favorite perfume
EDIT: // ***REVIEWERS*** I have learned from other users of this product that Auric Blends has changed the Egyptian Goddess scent in the last six months or so. It seems my review is not of the original scent and according to them the original scent is far superior than the new watered down and altered scent which is what I have reviewed. PLEASE TAKE CAUTION that the older reviews of this scent are reviews of the scent you can no longer attain and the more recent reviews like mine are reviews of this different version of Egyptian Goddess. It's a shame but let this knowledge aid you in your decision about this. Please pay attention to only the more recent reviews of this scented oil. Thank you.***Okay so I just received this roll on oil perfume and the moment I opened it I sniffed the bottle. I could barely smell anything so here I am confused and wondering if the less positive reviews were true and this perfume really had little to no scent! Not only that but the scent wasn't sweet although I don't think I really knew what to expect.Still I decided to give it a chance; I rolled some on my arm.  minutes later I notice I can smell it a bit. I brought my arm up and sniffed- aahhhh! There it is the scent was much stronger! The perfume needs a bit of heat to strengthen up and emanate properly so definitely don't judge it by sniffing the bottle.As for the scent a lot of reviews are very general about the actual scent so you might not know what to expect of the scent. I'm definitely growing to like the scent myself. I gave it  stars because it wasn't what I was used to but it's definitely not an offensive smell.The smell is not sweet. There is a slight musk to it and the smell really does change according to your body chemistry. Sometimes it smells like incense to me or an earthy and warm scent sometimes it smells like a fresh river and other times it smells like a sensual massage oil with a bit of spice to it. It's really difficult to describe now that I'm trying haha!BUT I can definitely say the scent is correctly named. When I smell this perfume I imagine being in a lavish Egyptian temple as a queen with a papyrus-laden river flowing nearby. It smells queenly it smells exotic and regal. No old lady nonsense but a scent gives off an aura of mystery sensuality and power. It's lightly scented so it's nothing that will make you sneeze.If you'd like to sweeten it a little bit a drop of Pure Instinct blends with it quite nicely I must say! It still retains its aura but with a non-clashing hint of sweetness.I'm used to more sweet and floral scents so this is quite the change for me but I am certainly adapting quickly. I only applied the oil to my arm near my wrist and it's been  hours and I can still smell it in a pleasant and non-overpowering way.It's a keeper! Definitely Give It A Chance To Shine Before Judging!,little bit
I purchased these when my usual cleansing towelettes (Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes Refill Pack  Count) were out of stock at the commissary.  I know that Pond's has many quality products since the original version of these face wipes is my go-to whenever I need a back up or feel like a change and I really like them but I didn't like the Evening Soothe version of this product at all.I think that Pond's towelettes in general leave a little bit too much cleanser behind which feels kind of filmy to me but that is not a huge flaw because I can simply rinse my face when I'm done using the wipe.  However the overly-strong perfume that was added to the Evening Soothe wipes was entirely too intense for my liking.  I literally avoided inhaling the fragrance while using because of the copious amount of scent then spent a lot of time rinsing my face off when I was done.I know that everyone is able to tolerate different amounts of perfume and that to some people these are not too strong at all but to me this was too big of a problem to be able to continue use.  To be fair I will say that I do not use perfume on a daily basis and when I do use it it's in very small doses.In all I personally wouldn't recommend these particular face wipes unless one really likes heavily-fragranced towelettes. Too much fragrance for my taste,Neutral
These were a surprising find -- I love everything about these little towelettes.  I began using them in October after reading a review in a magazine and was immediately impressed so much that I included them as stocking stuffers in all of the girl's stockings at our family Christmas.  They're so convenient at night time.  All I have to do is grab one swipe it across my face and neck and I'm good to go. So much easier than having to mess with cleanser water and a washcloth.  They are surprisingly effective at removing dirt and makeup even eye makeup (though they might not work on heavy mascara) and they smell fantastic.  I was very skeptical about the self-sealing foil package but it works quite well and I haven't had any problems with the towelettes drying out.I like to use thePonds Wet Cleansing Towelettes Morning Refresh -Count (Pack of )h in the morning and these in the evening -- but I use the evening wipes much more consistently.  These leave my skin soft and clean but not at all goopy or sticky like a heavier cream cleanser might.  I would think they'd work well on normal of just-slightly-dry skin but might not be the best for acne-prone or oily skin.  The morning refresh towelettes seem a little more astringent so I would recommend those for oilier skin.  They do have a fairly strong scent which I find very clean and appealing not perfumey or cloying but if you are sensitive to scent you might want to give these a pass.  Overall though highly recommended. LOVE THESE!!,Neutral
I would have given this a  star rating if the smell was better it's very strong and perfumey but they do a good job exfoliating and cleaning my skin.  I have noticed that I break out less using these and it's so easy at night. Nice Wipes,Neutral
I love everything about these towelettes -- the convenience the scent the effectiveness.  I tried them after reading a favorable review in a magazine and was immediately impressed so much that I included them as stocking stuffers in all of the girl's stockings at our family Christmas.  They're super convenient to just grab and wipe and they do an effective job of removing grime and makeup -- although I don't know that they could tackle heavy mascara they leave my face feeling very clean and fresh in the morning. I feel like my skin is so fresh and glowing after using these in the morning that I have cut back on using foundation and often just use a little sunscreen and blush.  I also really like the scent which is clean and pleasant not perfumey -- but if you're sensitive to scent you might want to give these a pass.  Overall I would recommend these highly -- and the Amazon price is great. LOVE THESE TOWELETTES,Neutral
Best perfume in the world! I love the scent get so  many compliments from both women and men.  I just love it.  time for a new bottle! Best perfume!,Neutral
This perfume smells lovely. It's very floraly with a hint of sweetness. The bottle is also very pretty. It's a nice addition to my perfume collection. I gave it  stars instead of  only because it's staying power is less than my other perfumes. It seems to fade after a half day maybe even less. Lovely,Neutral
Fast shipping. The perfume is great everywhere I go people ask what perfume I have on. If you are looking for a perfume that lasts long this is the one for you. Love this perfume,Neutral
I was surprised and really liked the scent of this perfume. I wanted for my wife and I bought it. Now she feels happier because I really like the smell. That delicious arom,Neutral
This is one of those perfumes you MUST have in your collection.  It's a great fragrance that has just the right amount of everything: femininity citrus floral patchouli.  I imagine this would smell great on all females and it's great for day or night. In my opinion Gucci Guilty is the kind of perfume you would want if you were only allowed one fragrance for the rest of your life. It's just a classic scent that is not too overpowering so it never gets old. And I love the bottle - gold greatness! SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS!,Neutral
I first sniffed this scent in a fashion magazine and I had to have it. My sweetheart and I have affectionately labeled this perfume sex in a bottle. It just oozes sensuality and sex without being overbearing and too powerful. It is very feminine but strong at the same time. When I wear this I usually wind up with a nose or two in my neck sniffing which can be a little uncomfortable but it's a huge compliment. I would not say it's for teens but I would say YES this is for a grown up woman as it is a very mature scent. I personally find no flaws with this perfume but every woman has her idea of what the perfect perfume is. Just as I sing this perfumes praises someone else might totally hate it.Bottom line...It is in my top  fav perfumes and I will continue to wear it. If your tastes are similar to mine I do recommend this perfume to you. Love at first sniff,Neutral
This is perfume for women who love perfume. It is heady floral delicious and very sexy. It can be worn night or day. May be heavy for office use (but I just use less) WOW,Neutral
Delicious! This perfume is so lovely with a gentle scent that is not overpowering yetgets your attention. Would purchase again Gently beautiful,Neutral
This isn't a scent I wear everyday but that doesn't mean I don't love it.  It's really feminine but hardcore as well.  I think I remember reading a magazine article a few years back saying they added the smell of leather which a lot of people hate but I love the smell of leather.  It is very unique and you won't find another scent that is exactly like it.  It's totally rock'n'roll and that's becoming more popular lately.  For me it's a good smell.  The bottle is adorable and though it's not the highest of high class designs you're paying for something that works well.  I've had this for two..ish years and the spray on the bottle still works well.  My Jennifer Aniston perfume basically fell apart after less than a year and it was three times as expensive when I got it. love this scent,Neutral
Outspoken was the fragrance that got me interested in the floral/fruit fragrances.  I'd leave  the Avon catalog open to the scratch patch just so I could smell it in the air.  I'd use a sample wipe then put the pad in my bra to keep the fragrance going  It smells delicious: not too flowery with a touch of freshness and depth added by the leather notes. It just makes me happy to smell it!  When I saw it for sale on Amazon for a reasonable price I've ordered a small bottle. Between the infrequency that I wear perfume and the collection of perfume I have it will last for awhile.  Meanwhile the attractive black bottle will be on display. SPEAKING OUT,Neutral
I tend to wear my hair with as little product as possible most days.I have natural thick wavy hair that likes to frizz. Currently it's about shoulder length and it's mid-summer. Its been getting braided and worn in pony tails often and taking a beating from sun exposure and pool water. This cream works pretty good at taming down the biggest frizz and gives it some shine. Has a bit of a perfume smell but not over whelming for me.  I would use it again and since it's fewer than five dollars will be willing to try the shampoo and conditioner also. Works well and low cost,Neutral
To me this fragance its actually a mixture of a lot of perfumes of the 's aqua di gio ck one and some others. The main problem againts this version is the projection and duration does not last more than  or  hours tops but smells like a paradisic modern island its actually very good luxury and refined like a exotic fruit.What i like to do to have a more powerful and lasting duration its to spray  in my hands and use it like a cologne you gotta try :) last more and has a smell no lady could resist. Versace's elixir,Neutral
This is a heavy heady and spicey perfume for winter use. Unfortunately there is too much musk or cinnamon or some other note I find unpleasant. In tiny doses not bad but overall I would not purchase again. not for me,Neutral
Update: Since my initial review I've been able to wear it once without disliking it.I have Queen of Hearts' predecessor Queen and gave it an unreserved -star review. I expected to like Queen of Hearts even better but I can't seem to get used to it. I mainly get overpowering jasmine or something similar something candy-like maybe the cinnamon others are describing but to me it's like a cinnamon air freshener and something kind of sour like rubber. After an hour it turns into something inoffensive but indistinct for me and faint. Maybe my sense of smell is just getting burned out from the initial intensity but if I liked this perfume I think I'd be disappointed in its longevity certainly compared to Queen which is a marathon runner when it comes to longevity.I'm finding that perfumes can sometimes grow on me after a few tries or on a different day in a different mood so I'll keep trying it and update my review if my opinion changes.The packaging is the same beautiful presentation as Queen's but in an even lovelier color scheme deep turquoise and gold instead of Queen's red and gold with the box lining and insert done in turquoise. It's a shame the only turquoise that shows up on the new bottle itself is on the flat part on top of the cap. Not working on me.,Neutral
I love this perfume and the other one also. It smells so sexy and sensual will always buy this one Love this,Neutral
I really enjoyed this one. It is a very classy scent. The packaging the bottle and cap makes it look as a much more expenxive fragrance. Quite a nice perfume good for nights out. Kinda spicy/sweet. Too bad its lasting power once applied is so short. It's OK I guess.,Neutral
i honestly expected a more expensive smell like Queen but its not. i love love love Queen..this is a more floral smell but it softens into a nice just sutle smell. i would wear it for small events where you want to wear perfume to have a slight scent that the only way to smell it is if someone had their nose to your neck. i wouldnt put it on strong as it has a super strong smell at first. it reminds me of original Amarige to be honest just cheaper. nice,Neutral
I agree with reviewers who've called it long-lasting not overpowering and smelling like a store that sells perfume oils and incenses. It is subtle and sensual and a little goes a long way.  I don't love it more than Queen but each has it's place. I just realized Queen of Hearts reminds me of Avon Night Magic. VERY GOOD,long way
Got it today it is pretty intense to me on the smell now that doesn't mean thats bad. I am quite surprised by it seeing that the color of the perfume itself which it is of a light color. It has a strong musk smell and a softness to it at the same time. It reminds me of my other perfume I bought a while back called: BVLGARI (Jasmin Noir). Which has the same intensity and its of a darker color. Queens perfume lasts a long time so far I've worn it for a little over  hours and counting it has the same potency as it did the moment I did applied it on. I personally think this is not a cheap product but a pretty well made perfume and it last. The bottle is cute with the design I like the heart which cleverly details it to have a pulsating look with an illusion to the bottle. It appears to be something she thought well of in the design. I would recommend this to a girlfriend. :)  Oh and its inexpensive..to boot. Great Perfume...Queen. :-),long time
Wow I did not think that this perfume would smell so good I got it Ross the other day for only $ dollers and do not regret buying it. It has a sweet soft flower scent to it witch are smells that im drawn into. But if sweet and flowers are your style then get this you will detnitly like this!! Give me that sweet stuff!,Neutral
I didn't think this scent was as knock your socks off as some of the other reviewers but it is acceptible.  I don't love it but it's definitely adequate for every day wear.That being said the thing I REALLY do like is the convenience of having a rollerball perfume to carry in my purse!  The size is easy to fit anywhere and the lid is tight fitting so I don't need to worry about any leakage. It's great for on-the-go touchups in restaurant bathrooms after working out at the gym while traveling in the car and more. You can discretely apply in confined spaces without gassing everyone in the area out with a spray.I wish more perfumes came in this format - I'd definitely buy them! Mediocre scent but great convenience!,Neutral
I got a sample of Twirl to try before I buy. I must say this perfume is lovely.  Its sweet floral and soft.  Everything blends perfectly together.  I wore this scent  days ago.  I put it on my neck and shirt. It lasted all day!! My husband said I smelled wonderful and what was I wearing? I told him it was Twirl.  The same shirt I wore  days ago was still sitting on my recumbent bike today  days later (shame on me) and I could still smell the perfume on it.  I will def be buying this soon.  A def good buy. Awesome scent!,Neutral
OMG SMELLS SO FLIPPEN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!! I love it so much! Fits the warm weather too! YAY PERFUME! :D I can't even begin to describe how good twirl smells! :P MMMMMMMMMMM!,Neutral
Unlike me who loves the strong female scents think Chanel Mademoiselle my fiancee is not a big fan. I received a sample of Twirl with a purchase a few weeks back and it didn't take more then a week or two before my amazon order of this perfume was completed. My fiancee say's it smells like me and don't find it over powering and I love that it reminds me of clean clothes and femininity. The only downside is that it doesn't last long on my skin. And although it won't burn the midnight oil on those late autumn nights (I love my Chanel Mademoiselle to much) it will serve as a good scent during work. Not overpowering fresh and clean scent,Neutral
I'm a Guess fan. And everything by Guess looks like of good taste to me. And it wasn't different with the perfume. I love how this one smells and how it stays in your skin. I love the scent of this perfume.,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume. It smells GREAT! It is very soft and seductive. I can wear this for work or play. Every time I wear it I get so may compliments. Great PRICE..I love Guess Seductive,favorite perfume
This is my favorite perfume and you can't beat the price!  I get a ton of compliments on this scent.  It's not over-powering and lasts all day.  I can't smell it on myself but others can.  I always spray the center of my chest which tends to be the first place to warm up in even mildly stressful situations and it seems to radiate the scent nicely... I've noticed I get the most compliments when I feel a bit flushed.  The scent is hard to describe - it's not floral it's just plain sexy. Smells fabulous!,favorite perfume
I was curious to try these out because I've really enjoyed other products from Ole Henriksen (TheOle Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask . Fluid Ounceis a favorite and I also likeOle Henriksen Sheer Transformation Age Defence . Fluid Ounce.) so I was curious how the wipes would compare to the drug store brands of wipes I've previously tried.So far my feelings are mixed at least for my skin type.  On the positive side the cloth feels both substantial and soft on my face and appropriately saturated with cleanser.  It was moist enough to clean my whole face easily but not so wet that it was sopping.  I also enjoy that unlike theAveeno Active Naturals Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads  Countthese don't seem to leave any residue behind and don't require any rinsing.  I love it because it truly does save time and makes it a more convenient option when I need to clean my face on the go quickly like at the gym.I especially enjoyed the scent of these.  It's a very pungent orange vanilla scent that makes it much more perfumed than other wipes I've tried.  Of course it means it also may not be the best option if you are sensitive to scented products.  (I think theSimple Radiance Wipes  Countare a great option if you are looking for something less scented as I really liked those as well.)As far as how well they work I thought these did a good job of removing makeup.  But at times they did seem to sting my skin a little but thankfully this didn't happen every time I used them.  (Though I do think the aforementioned Simple wipes are a tad better for sensitive skin.)  I also can't say that I've seen the benefits of the active ingredients in these wipes. I haven't exactly experienced any brightening tightening skin repair or any of the other benefits mentioned on the brand's website.  However I certainly didn't expect to either.Overall I thought these were on par with the brands of wipes I've previously used and possibly like the Simple wipes a bit better since they seem gentler on sensitive skin.  However I do think the scent of these is really differentiating and makes them feel like more of a treat and could make them a great choice for people with normal/less sensitive skin. Love the scent but cleaning power doesn't 'wow' me.,sensitive skin
Added some of this citronella oil plus some orange oil and perfume to my body lotion and the mosquitos hate it. Haven't been bitten once since I started using it. Repels mosquitos,Neutral
I have used Carmex lip moisturizing in the tube for yearsCarmex - Lip Moisturizing Tube Original Balm - . Oz ( each). I like that product a lot so decided to try this skin care healing cream.The good news is that I like this cream too. It has a light fragrance that I do not mind. I'm sensitive to overly perfumed scents and this is not strong nor objectionable.I squirt about an inch long strip of this on the back of one of my hands and then just rub in in with both hands. It's not greasy and absorbs quickly yet leaves a soft moisturized feeling on my skin.I can't say that this is the best or my favorite hand cream because it isn't. But I can say that I like this and I find the tube convenient to use in the car. It's not expensive like my favorite hand cream is and it's what I'll grab first when my hands are feeling a little dry. If I need to bring out the heavy artillery then I'll go get my favorite cream that goes on a little thicker and does leave a more greasy feeling on my hands.This is a good body cream at a fair price. Very nice cream that absorbs easily and leaves a non-greasy feeling on hands,Neutral
If you want a moisturizing lotion go for it it if you want something that smells like green apple then leave it alone.  This lotion smells wonderfully just like green apple while in the bottle but once you rub it on your skin the scent is gone within  seconds.  I purchased this because I was wanting a green apple scent but dislike perfumes. I could've gotten  unscented &#;pure&#; body creams anwywhere for $. This was a mistake on my part. I will not  purchase any &#;scented&#; lotions from this label after having  this experience unless I plan to leave it in the bottle with the cap off so I can actually tell that it has a scent. Does NOT smell like green apple!,Neutral
This perfume I ordered strictly based on the reviews and without ever smelling it (which I never do!). It smells absolutely awesome and I have had a ton of compliments. It is a clean sort of jasmine like smell and it seems to last a really long time. The shipping was fast and I thought it was an excellent price. Will definitely be ordering again soon! A+++++ Perfect,long time
Womanity is the type of fragrance I could go on and on about.Upon first spray it is very VERY intense and even overwhelming - there is something smoky and even masculine about it that I was initially uncertain about. However as it wears it transforms into a sweet and slightly salty beautiful absolutely fascinating utterly captivating scent. It is very long lasting - when I spray it on my wrist in the morning (a single tiny spray) I can still smell it the following day.I think this makes a great going out scent and will also be great for the summer. I have worn it at work though I am always hesitant because it is initially so strong... If I put it on a few hours before I have to go to work I find that the intensity has worn off by then but then again you never know how sensitive other people's noses are. So it's important to be cautious with this one.You also have to keep in mind this is a polarizing fragrance because it does not work well with a lot of people's body chemistry - very few people love it and a lot more seem to hate it in the fragrance fanatic world (just read the reviews on fragrantica and you'll see what I mean). This is actually what initially got me interested in Womanity - I feel a little extra special knowing that I am one of the few lucky people who can wear this unique perfume and smell fantastic all the while.This is my first Thierry Mugler fragrance and I can say without a doubt that I am officially a fan!(FYI I purchased the . ounce bottle from Fragrancenet - the juice was not pink but a light yellowy-orange color which tends to happen to fragrance that has sat around for a while - do not let this turn you off! the fragrance is still legit and the price is beyond fantastic) Beautiful Mysterious Unique Perfume,Neutral
Another great favorite from Bvlgari. It smells very masculine spicy maybe a hint of sweet. It reminds me of classical men perfumes it is similar to the scents of calvin klein's contradiction and euphoria only better and stronger... i find it to be long lasting...but this is not something you want to spray generously as it can be overpowering...my girlfriend loved it and said it smelled very manly and sexy... Masculine long lasting and great,Neutral
Love love love it it give my hair volume and shine. It has a perfume scent if you're sensitive to smell it may be too strong for you but other than that I LOOOOVE IT. Great stuff!!!,Neutral
For an item that you are going to put on your face this certainly is a highly perfumed product. Covergirl Natureluxe Silk Foundation is supposed to be something with coverage to it but that isn't really the case. I felt like I had put a really stinky moisturizer on. It really did not enhance my complexion the way I had hoped. I suppose I could use it as a moisturizer and apply my makeup on top of it but the smell is just too much of a deal-breaker. So I guess I pretty much threw my money away on this one. I really do not care for it. Sorry but no.,Neutral
This styling product provides the definition I need without extra stiffness or flaking. The product smells good but doesn't overpower my perfume. It's definitely worth the purchase--especially for a hair... Excellent product,Neutral
I work an office job where my desk often feels like a super highway of papers. This leaves my hands dry and cracking. It's hard to find a lotion that's unscented but doesn't have the classic unscented smell.  (Putting hand lotion on almost hourly means if it's perfumey I'll be gagging by the end of the day). I also wanted natural without sacrificing effectiveness. Enter Yes to Carrots! It has a light natural smell that wears off almost instantly. It's not greasy at ALL (something I despise in hand creams) and soaks into the skin quite nicely. I find in winter I sometimes need a little more than this lotion can give so I have a travel sized jar of the Yes to Carrots body butter I keep with me. (This one however is a tiny bit greasy. But it absorbs well enough that I'm not too bothered by it).I should also mention I have skin that will break out even on places like my arms if I use too heavy or scented of a lotion. Not with this product! I've even gotten desperate enough to put it on my face a few times and had no break outs what so ever. It's gentle and effective. My favorite lotion by far,Neutral
this is the best hair oil everHIGHLY RECOMMENDEDthe fragrance smells like a perfume  more than a hair oilit feels sooo light that it will leave your hair feeling incredible it'll never make ur scalp hot or feels annoyingAlthough it didn't soften my Hair at all coz I have an unruly hair which is impossible to manage without a hair dryer . It made no difference to me except the quality for this product was excellent best hair oil ever,Neutral
I have been using Lumi*Essence for several months.  It is very creamy when first applied but then melts right into the skin so there's no greasy residue.  While I have well-entrenched areas of hyperpigmentation around my eyes and upper cheeks Lumi*Essence use along with other products in Sweetsations' line (toner eye area treatment moisturizer/sunscreen) have brightened my skin and kept the areas from getting any darker.  No redness or irritation no reaction to any ingredients in any of the Sweetsations line all smell delightful not too perfume-y.  Highly recommended for purity and scent (pleasant but not overpowering).Update May  :  After using this product for more than a year (along with other products in the Sweetsation Therapy line) I am happy to report an overall evening and lightening of my entire face.  As part of an overall healthier lifestyle and improved self-care regimen Lumi-Essence has proven invaluable.  If you are in this for the long haul and not just seeking a magic bullet quick fix I'd go with the entire line of Sweetsations Therapy skin care.  I am very pleased with the tone and texture of my skin.*Addendum //:  Use as directed continues to replenish and renew the texture of my skin.  Application of small amounts of Lumi*Essence to my neck and throat keep the skin supple and less crepe-y after a weight loss of about  lbs. over the past eight months.  Nothing else I've used has the noticeable effect of Sweetsation Therapy's skin care line. Great Scent Great Absorption!,Neutral
Coach's Poppy perfume is awesome! Very young and fresh. Great for teens and preteens as well as adults! Also has a relatively long lasting time. Great perfume.,Neutral
I love love love coach poppy perfume!!! I have tried all the coach perfumes available and this is the only one I like!! It's a sexy not overbearing kind of perfume  it lasts all day a little goes a long way makes my husband melt and I get many compliments when I wear :) great to wear any season for any occasion!! Came packaged excellant and $ cheaper than in local store :)) Fabulous,long way
I purchased this perfume several months ago and love it as much as the day I bought it. It is a light very girly scent which stays on for a full day. Lots of other perfumes I have bought (some of which have been more expensive than this one) seem to wear off mid-day which is super frustrating. This perfume however seems to stay on all day and I can still smell it at night when I come home. I usually put  sprays on my neck/chest area and a couple on my wrist and rub them together. It is such a wonderful smell. I will definitely keep purchasing this perfume for years to come. I would highly recommend other coach perfumes as well because they all smell so good! One of my favorite perfumes,Neutral
First let me say there is nothing WRONG with this perfume. I just think that for the price tag and for the quality that usually goes along with the brand it's nowhere near as good as it should be. What I get from this is well plain and simple poppy flowers. This is something I'd allow my prepubescent daughter to wear. There is no depth and maybe just a tiny bit of sweetness. I think if Coach threw in a ton of vanilla and a little bit of spice to create a whole lot more complex oriental-type scent this could be a real winner. That being said if you are looking for a simple everyday summer perfume that won't offend perhaps you'll love this. I feel like it's for kids and well... I'm a woman! It's just ok.,little bit
Bought this as a valentines day present for my wife and she loves it. I can't complain when she wears it. It's a perfect perfume that isn't too powerful. - sprays will last all day when my wife wears it. The wife loves the smell!,Neutral
I was looking for a different perfume but at a great price and of course I found it on amazon! I absolutely love this scent it is long lastly and goes great with any occasion or time of the year! great perfume,Neutral
There is one thing I have a weakness for; that would be perfume. I love trying new perfumes so I decided to pick up the Coach Poppy to give it a try.I am very picky about my scents. I don't like it to be too brash; I wear perfumes that have more of a soft flowery smell. That said I can spend hours at a perfume counter spraying various perfumes on the little sticks. I try not to do this too long and try not to be judgmental of one spritz; as we all know perfume smells completely different when you spray it on yourself.Poppy is expensive but there's a reason. It actually stays on me all day. I do two spritz on my chest and spray my wrists to rub it on my neck. I love coming home after a long (and sweaty) day and still smelling the fresh smell of this perfume. My fiance has given me MANY compliments which frankly had me sold. The smell is perfect for work.This is more of a day scent whereas I switch my perfumes if I go out at night. I highly recommend Ed Hardy by Ed Hardy Women or Victoria's Secret Vixen (found at victoriassecret.com) for nighttime use. New Favorite,Neutral
As a toner the conditioner does its job. However it doesn't seem to condition well at all. The shampoo is very strong-smelling actually the smell of both the shampoo and the conditioner is intense.It's heavily perfumed I'd describe it as a very chemical/floral scent or an extremely old-school grandmother smell. (No offense to any grandmothers out there!) That being said this product does help with toning out yellow/brassy shades in blonde hair.If you leave the conditioner on for a few minutes you can really see the toning effect however the formula of both the shampoo and the conditioner is very runny and hard to apply evenly. (Plus the smell!) I find that my hair doesn't feel particularly clean after using the shampoo(and that terrible scent lingers on my hair forever afterwards). And it doesn't feel especially conditioned after using the conditioner. But it DOES tone out brassiness. So at least there's that.(But oh god THE SMELL). The smell!,Neutral
Well first of all: love the price. Could you believe that my local drug store (CVS) offers this combo for $. ??? Are they out of their minds? Secondly love the shampoo and conditioner. Wonderful moisturizer for hair adds shine and flexibility. My hair feels silky after each use. So easy to manage no tangling. Oh and did I mention the smell? This combo smells SO GOOD that I wish this company made their own perfume smelling just like the shampoo and conditioner. Smells Great And Does Exactly What It Says,Neutral
Some fragrance free products contain masking fragrance - a chemical added to negate all the smells found in an item. This lotion does not have that. I am very sensitive to perfumes in lotions and breakout into a rash or hives. I can sometimes tolerate beauty products with masking fragrance - other times I cannot.This product does not contain a masking fragrance. It is a thick lotion that I like to use on my arms and legs. I find it a bit too thick for my hands. This definitely takes away the itch of dry skin. Recommended. Creamy No Masking Fragrance and Does the Jo,dry skin
I would like to say though that I just don't think self tanning is for me. I've not used any others so I can't compare it to anything. Here is what I did not like.  The smell.  OMG I don't know what that smell is but it didn't go away.  I have a small seborrheic keratoses spot on the side of my leg near my knee that completely blends in with my skin and goes unnoticed during the winter months but if my legs get sun in the summer it turns white and sticks out...with this stuff it turns a super dark brown. LOL I should just get natural sun and put this stuff on it with a Qtip LOL. Seriously though even though I exfoliated and did what the directions said around the knees and elbows they still got too dark.  The mitt kept coming off my hand.  I might just be really bad at applying self tanner though but the smell ... I just can't get over that. I could still smell it after my shower and perfume :( I hated this product,Neutral
I have been an avid tanner for years. I have tried every UV bed spray tan and tanning lotion on the market. I have olive skin when I'm tan so I try to go for the natural brown and not orange look. UV beds were addictive until at age  I had to have a tumor removed from my skin. Seriously if you use conventional UV tanning I guarantee you'll care when you get tumors/cancer and your skin will seriously age by . I now have a scar on my chest less than cute! Spare yourself the scarring if all you care about is looks.I had a membership for sunless tanning that seemed to be the only way to get a regular tan somewhat conveniently. At home tanners never got me as dark and were all streaky when applied.THIS TANNING SPRAY AND MIT SET IS AMAZING!! This stuff is sooo easy to use and gives me an instant dark tan with the bronzer and develops to a very natural colored dark tan over a few hours so that by the time you shower and rinse off the bronzer you are tan underneath. This DOES NOT rub off on clothes and goes on so easily. I spray the mit about four or five times and rub it onto my skin. The fantastic thing about this spray is that you can add more or continue to blend it into skin and it doesn't get all dry and streaky like other sunless tanners. I've never had to leave streaks due to too many layers of tanner or too many attempts to blend it. The combination of the gloves and mit completely prevents my hands from staining. The mit makes application incredibly fast and smooth streak free. This stuff dries amazingly fast (you can still add more to the dry parts to add more color or even out a streak) and doesn't get on clothes. Where I used to have to carefully apply lotion wash my hands a million times and stand around naked waiting to dry now I quickly apply this and immediately go get dressed. My skin always looks tan now. It takes only about five minutes to apply over the whole body. There is literally no inconvenient aspect to this spray. It is as easy as drying your skin off with a towel only you're applying tan. It lasts for about three days and then when it starts to fade it does so evenly and without patchy spots. You can even add contouring to your body (think extra cleavage and instant abs). I am so excited to find this product. I am canceling my spray tan membership which will save my hundreds a year I don't have to worry about skin damage AND I can easily look great every day. Amazing.Update: This is still my favorite tanner months after my original purchase and after trying several others including mousses and sprays. I just ordered my second Fake Bake kit. My mitt wore out around the time that I ran out of tanner. It was still usable but had little pills on it that caused streaking. I had also been using it with other tanning products so if I had used it alone it would have out-lasted the Fake Bake spray. So you get a new mitt every time you buy this product and the mitt lasts through the use of the entire  ounces. I washed it after every tan application with warm water and whatever hand soap I had on hand. I then let it air dry. I did cut the plastic pump bottle tube so that it was not longer than the bottle is tall. I will do that again with my new one. This product smells so good that I actually get complimented on what scent I'm wearing as if I'm wearing perfume. It's a tropical coconut smell. The reason this is hands down my favorite tanner even though I've found one that is darker (St. Moriz Dark Mousse) is that it is so easy to apply and dries so fast that as soon as I set down the bottle and wash the mitt I can go get dressed. It always looks really even not splotchy even when I'm being lazy and apply it without much attention. Even my most hard-core tanning friends don't like tanning every day because their products are a hassle and they have to wait an hour to put on clothes. You could easily use this every day. Takes me  minutes tops and always looks better than being pale! BEST FORM OF TANNING!!,Neutral
I bought this thinking it was a leave-in conditioner.  It didn't really condition my hair that way... obviously because it wasn't a conditioner.  When I realized this I thought Duh of course it's leave-in.  You leave-in hair spray and gel and heat protectant too.  So I thought that was kind of misleading.I guess the product is okay... no different than any other product I've tried  The thing that really makes me give it two stars is the fact that not only is it nothing special but it is an ATTACK on the senses.  WAY too much fragrance.  I like me some fragrance in fact I like the way Eversleek smells but holy hell this stuff is way way too much perfume.  I find it easier to just use some heat protectant some argan oil and be on my merry way. It's only okay,argan oil
I think SPF  is the minimum sun protection factor anyone should be using on the face/neck.  I've used this all summer and now going into fall also and even though I've been outdoors sometimes hours at a time not once has my face or neck been burned. However if you have very dry skin this won't be moisturizing enough used alone. As soon as the furnace starts up I will probably need to use another more potent moisturizer in addition to this. It's a little perfumey-scented but it dissipates after a minute or so.  Once it soaks into the skin it doesn't feel sticky or tacky; however as far as doing anything for lines wrinkles or firming don't count on that unless you are young and showing the first signs of aging. A great SPF lotion for the face/neck questionable for very dry skin,dry skin
NOTE:  The picture Amazon is showing is incorrect this is not in a tube it's in an air-pump bottle.  I have uploaded a photo of the correct item you will receive.A little background:  I'm + dry hormonal skin I'd been using Olay's Regenerist and Total Effects with some Neutrogena items thrown in also for quite awhile but I'd hit a point where they weren't working so well for me.  So I picked up a few samples of Lancome's Genifique serum.Now after a few weeks I can compare Lancome's Genifique Youth Activating Concentrate and the L'Oreal Youth Code Serum.  In case you don't know L'Oreal owns Lancme.While I loved what Genifique did for my skin I couldn't justify spending $ for  ounce of serum. Youth Code is even better not only for the price but this:  After comparing these two serums their ingredient deck is almost identical except Youth Code contains two beneficial peptides that Genifique doesn't have as well as Youth Code contains N Hydroxysuccinimide which is an ester used in skincare that helps reduce dark pigments and inflammation of the skin.  Additionally Lancome's Genifique contains castor oil which I'd rather not ingest through my skin or my mouth (yuck!).The only bad thing I can say about the Youth Code is I notice a little more perfume-y scent to this compared to the Genifique but it dissipates in a minute or so.Youth Code has taken my skin up a notch from the Olay products.  I'm using Youth Code until something better comes along -- my skin is looking great and I'm saving a ton of money over the high-priced Genifique. Similar to Genifique but better & less expensive,Neutral
First I have to laugh at the reviews of heavy perfumed and I had breakouts  let's be real - you are very sensitive to smells obviously because this is no way perfumey!  And anyone can have a breakout from trying a new product.  So if this made you break out then yes this is not a product for your sensitive skin.  I think people w/sensitive skin should be buying sensitive skin products only.  Makes sense yes?  For us normal skin people - this cream is awesome!  It does what it says.  Regenerates.  I noticed a difference in two weeks.  Glowing smooth moist skin.  I use a little in the AM with my SPF and of course at bedtime - bedtime is the best for using your face creams as it gets to set all night.  You don't need a lot so it lasts a long time.  (Hint: for women to decrease wrinkles - use satin pillow cases only - also the satin does not absorb all your face creams like cotton cases.;)  I worked for a plastic surgeon and know all the prescription creams and treatments out there and you don't have to drop hundreds of dollars.  Perfect price for a great cream. GREAT moisturizer that makes a difference!,long time
I'm actually very pleased with this product. Of course at my age it's not going to do miracles but it definitely does lend the skin a quality of luminescence for a more youthful appearance. I was worried about skin sensitivites because the night cream does have a slight perfume. Many products don't work with my dry senstive skin but I've had no problems with either the night cream or the lotion.So after trying it now for over two weeks I am very happy with the product and would not hesitate to add it to my skin care regime. An Appearance of Youth,Neutral
I'm always hesitant to try new moisturizers or cleansers because I have terrible allergies to anything that is even the least bit scented.  The moisturizers in this set do have a light scent which was pleasant to smell but unfortunately did cause my eyes to water and my nose to clog.  It has a very smooth nongreasy feel on your skin which I really liked so I wish it were available in an unscented version.  The eye cream is unscented and is really wonderful.  I always wake up with slight under eye puffiness.  The applicator on the tube has a cooling metallic tip that you use to rub in the cream.  It instantly makes your eyes look and feel less puffy.  I will continue to buy and use it regularly.  If the moisturizing lotion and cream come in an unscented version I'll be buying those on a regular basis as well.For anyone whose skin is starting to show signs of aging I think this would be a great set to try.  I only used the moisturizers twice and my skin was already starting to look better.  If I didn't have perfume allergies I know it would have been my new every day moisturizer. The Eye Cream is a New Favorite,Neutral
I've never been a faithful conditioner user but I'm hooked on this stuff. I was a little worried the Moroccan argan oil would leave my hair greasy. That hasn't happened it all. I really think it's making my hair shinier and I know it's softer and easier to style because it's less frizzy. The conditioner smells amazing like some kind of expensive perfume but the fragrance is subtle and not at all overwhelming.  My hair is naturally fine wavy and easily weighed down so I don't condition the roots just to be sure I don't lose volume. I'm really happy with this conditioner and I've been using the matching shampoo as well. Smells great leaves hair soft and shiny,argan oil
This is one of my favorite perfumes. Very light scent with a pretty bottle. I have the smaller size that I carry in my purse to freshen up with throughout the day. I wish this scent lasted longer. One of my favorites,Neutral
I like it!! The perfume got in time and in perfect conditions. About the perfume it is Ok I thought it would be awesome as other Britney's perfumes however I noticed that smells a little bit light (for me). It delicious but if you like to wear all they your perfume you should spray it several times... It's OK,little bit
I will either end up giving this perfume away strong perfumes bother me andI bought this before I had asthma but Britney's perfumes are good but rememberless worn is best. have asthma cannot wear perfume,Neutral
I opened up the rollerball that I bought as a tester and the kittens came running over to smell this fruity/musky delight. I have never seen pets appear to enjoy perfume. Anyway it is not very sophisticated but pleasant a very nice scent as described in other reviews. Suitable mainly for younger women under  and casual wear. Enjoy! My cats came running,Neutral
you to buy perfumes Brithney because I really like but this is the best I get super fast in perfect condition I think it is the best perfume has an extensive durability and is nice to everyone what I like most is its besides price that I can not believe how fast I get there I recommend this perfume to girls from age  to adult  to  years is sweet floral smells delicious! love this perfume,Neutral
I think Britney has very good fragances. I love the bottle and concept for her Fantasy Twist. I wanted to give a try to this perfume and so far I can tell that I am not dissapointed. Very floral femenine and last enough on my skin. Very radiant,Neutral
I love this perfume a lot. I'm picky about perfumes and this one is amazing. So refreshing and sweet with a small hint of floral. I don't like other Britney fragrances but this one is awesome! Fruity fresh and happy,Neutral
Noticed a darker tan with this lotion from the very first use! So it does the job....I also like how it goes on nice and smooth when applying it. The smell is alright not bad.. You can't ever expect to smell like you put fresh perfume when stepping out of a tanning bed or stand up. Over all it's a good lotion. I would probably purchase another one once this one is done :) Does the job.,Neutral
I was not 'blown away' with this product either.  It works ok but this one has a super strong odor that stinks! I will not buy this again but will use what I have until it is gone.  Thus far my favorite tanning/bronzing lotion is the Playboy (although it has a VERY strong perfume odor to it but the results are great!) Another ok product,Neutral
I thought this would smell great like a Victoria's Secret store. Nope it smells like an old woman's cheap perfume.  It moisturizes about as well as any oher lotion but I'd rather have one that smells good. Old lady smell,Neutral
smells very good when im lazy to use perfume ill just use this aloneand id smell good the whole time..i dont understand why others complain about the scent. love the smell,Neutral
The first note is blackberries-not too sweet though. It fades into a softer scent as the day goes on. I don't smell much magnolia sadly I was hoping for a closer match to BBW discontinued Magnolia Blossom. This isn't very close but it is still a great perfume. smells like blackberries,Neutral
This is a sweet smelling perfume. But not too sweet. I love it. .oz lasts a long time. I have had mine for about  months now. I wear it everyday with  sprays a day. There is a little more than half the bottle left. LOVE,long time
Man I LOVE this perfume!  Smells incredible and I get so many complements wearing this. The bottle is big and lasts forever. This is definitely one of my HG perfumes. I'll buy this over and over. Love this!,Neutral
I love fresh crisp scents and this is just what doctor ordered. It is perfect for summer. It is light and flirty ideal for daytime. The only minor sad moment---this perfume does not last on me for too long only ~h or so. Such a fresh scent!,Neutral
I usually use Nutrogena Rainbath as a shower and bath gel and I like it very much. However I was running low and wondered if we had any more in the bathroom cabinet. Alas we didn't. But we did have three -ounce bottles of Dove beauty body wash. Evident;y my wife has been shopping around again looking for the perfect product. Well I'll give it a try.The Dove reminds me more of a lotion than a body wash. It smears on like an ointment and then rubs around rather than breaking into a sudsy lather. It seems almost reluctant to mix with water. It has a nice very light fresh scent rather than a spicey or perfumey scent. To me it's not anywhere as zesty as the Neutrogens Rainbath and I much prefer the more lathery body wash of the Neutrogena. Does it do the assigned job? Well it seems to. I'm satisfied. Does it moisturize my skin? I can't answer. If I had to choose between the Dove or Neutrogena which would I take? Neutrogena. Without question. We also use it on our three-year-old son and it seems to work and he seems to like it. Well I have my preferences and my wife has hers. One thing is certain. With three -ounce bottles we're going to be using the Dove for a long long time.Gary Peterson Good But Not My First Choice.,Neutral
I thought it would smell way better.  Smells like a cheaper perfume for an older lady.  I was disappointed.  To be fair I will say I didn't buy it from Amazon. Strong and doesn't smell expensive,Neutral
The perfect summer scent!  Fruity and sweet; very tropical.  The scent does wear off rather quickly though (which is why I took off  star) and has to be reapplied throughout the day. Purchased the . oz here on amazon.com for less than the price of a . oz bottle sold in Sephora or Ulta!  A great addition to my perfume collection. Escada Taj Sunset Perfume,Neutral
I purchased this at my local Perfumania and blow is my review from fragrantica.com:This is a tropical mango-ey beach-side-fruity-cocktail drink perfume through and through. This is my personal favorite of the Escada summer fragrances at the moment (I have owned/tried Moon Sparkle Rockin' Rio Sexy Graffitti and Born in Paradise) because it's sweet but not headache-inducing (I am not a gourmand person) and the mango note is the strongest note by far. If you like mango you'll love this. I would say that it is closest to Rockin' Rio but more...mango-ey lol.There isn't much development in the scent meaning I don't really smell any of the more floral/woody/musky scents even hours into wearing the perfume. The lasting power is decent but not incredible; I can spray this around PM and still smell it only myself when I sniff my wrists at PM as long as I'm not doing too much and running around all night.Overall I think it's a really nice girly summer fragrance and I would recommend it to a friend. Fruity tropical drink frangrance,Neutral
If you want to smell like a sweet sticky tropical alcoholic drink then this fragrance is for you. Hopefully you don't want that and in that case steer clear of this perfume! Ick,Neutral
Dove Visible care renewing creme based body wash has a clean fresh fragrance that goes with my more expensive parfume perfectly. You know how some body conditioners have complex cheap smells; that you can't wash with & then put on your perfume of choice.This one in particular works very well if you wash first then use it like a rinse. Rub it on as a conditioner just like after washing your hair; then rinse. You can wash with it too but I just like it this way best. There is a softer look to my arms legs and feet; that was noticable within  days. Don't forget to add a little body lotion to your routine. Yes this stuff works but it doesn't work miracles. Please no more cracked heels ashy ankles and ashy elbows! conditioner for your skin,Neutral
Well I'm impressed. This is by no means a face-lift in a jar but after using this product along with Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor (New Packaging) and the Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth FactorI have noticed a difference in my  yer old skin.This product makes a wonderful base for your foundation make-up and never feels overly greasy. It just makes your skin look a bit dewy and moist. The perfume-y smell disappears shortly after applying it. It absorbs quickly into your skin as long as you do not use too much of it to start.The lines and puffiness in the skin around my eyes have lost some of their harshness after less than  weeks of using twice a day. My under eye area looks a little more youthful.I come from the generation that thought is was wonderful to sun outside at the beach all day using baby oil with iodine in it to deepen your tan and now my skin is paying the price. I have looked long and hard for something that will help just a little and I really think that this trio of products fits the bill.Let me repeat ---> you will not see a huge difference in the deepest wrinkles (at least I didn't) but you will see a softening of those lines that powder and eye-shadow and foundation can get trapped in. I presume that with longer use I will see a bit more improvement to my face and that's all anyone can ask for. Skin Looks Dewy,Neutral
I am not a fan of this perfume.The scent is ordinary nothing special.I sent it gift.The only thing that i love is the design. Not a fan,Neutral
I love this perfume!  To me it smells like sweet grapefruit but not in a too citrus kind of way.  Just a lovely unique sweet smell.  Not too young for me (I'm in my s).  A new favorite!  My boyfriend loves it on me too :) Love it!  Sweet and fruity,Neutral
I ordered this perfume based in the good reviews on Amazon. I was looking for some fresh sweet fragance and good thing I wasnt wrong when ordering Pure Pink. It smells so delicious the bottle is cute and last long in my skin. I am gladly surprised by the perfume as well for its price. Not all cheap things are a waste of money. Nice Nice Nice,Neutral
I decided to try fairest nude because a lot of reviewers mentioned the color as being subtle and great for them. I am brunette with fair to medium skin tone with a few freckles. I do not like bright lipstick. Unfortunately for me fairest nude was exactly the same shade as my skin which made me look like a mummy. Also it had a perfume-y smell that smelled like an old lady's garage sale to me. I got a headache from the smell within ten minutes. It was worth a try but I will have to throw this one out. Fairest Nude: smell nearly killed me and the color made me look like the living dead,Neutral
Ok let me start by saying this stuff is not for the faint of heart or for beginners.  If you are just beginning to tan this will probably burn you like your first day on vacation in Florida without any sunscreen and you are from a northern state and never get out there as it is.  I've used a lot of different lotions; including some fairly powerful tingle lotions like Bombshell and Pink Diamonds.  At my salon I was warned that Pink Diamonds was more powerful than Bombshell but I disagreed.  I've used Luminary that I've ordered through Amazon before also and that has a SIMILAR effect to the Obsidian...but not nearly as powerful.  Let me start by saying THIS IS NOT A TINGLE LOTION.  This is just a standard silicone bronzer like Luminary by Designer skin but a step more powerful.  This is supposed to be the strongest bronzing lotion that Designer Skin makes as far as I know and after trying it I wouldn't doubt it.  So I begin like I always do; with application.  Depending on time of year (I live in Indiana) I put my lotion on just before getting into the tanning bed.  If I begin to feel warm or sweat I'll turn the fan on before hopping in (which is sometimes odd in late December but this has been an odd year with days that the temp was in the 's.)  The first thing I noticed while applying this lotion was a general warmth.  I also tan nude so I apply even below the belt and this turned out to be a mistake.  I've applied tingle lotions below the belt and generally I've never had a problem but I got so worried with this that I almost decided not to tan.  I've never felt that kind of warmth from a regular bronzing lotion and in certain (private) areas this was more than just a warmth...it was downright uncomfortable.  I decided to just be a man about it and go through with it.  I wasn't about to waste an entire application of the strongest Designer Skin bronzer on the market.  Immediately I noticed extra heat in the tanning bed (which is normal.  The stronger a lotion is; the more heat you will feel because its like you are getting more sun into your skin just like a high UV day in Florida where I grew up.)  I pulled my full  minutes in the bed; which is the maximum amount of time allowed per day in the type of bed I was in; (on a side note I had decided not to use the regular bed at my salon but what they call a Sunstorm which has burning bulbs above you and bronzing bulbs below so you do  minutes on each side for an even BUT STRONGER THAN USUAL tan.  This may have been another mistake with this lotion.)  So I finally get out of the bed and immediately feel like I'm going to fall over.  It was like instant sun-poisoning; I felt nauseous weak and shaky and I probably could have passed out at any moment...BUT I WASN'T GOING TO TELL ANYONE THAT LOL.  I've always rotated my lotions daily and I have  different bottles of lotion right now ( Designer Skin and  bottle of Australian Gold's Sinfully Black.)  I read somewhere that rotating lotions allows you to get the darkest by giving you a broader spectrum of light coverage.  I've always used my Luminary about once every  weeks due to the strength and more as a touch-up than anything else.  From this point forward the Obsidian is taking the place of my Luminary (which I'm almost out of) and considering it feels even stronger than the Luminary I will not be using the Obsidian in anything other than a regular bed (which at my salon consists of regular bulbs and  high pressure facial bronzers.)  On a last note this lotion is amazingly (surprisingly) powerful and should be used in moderation.  If you can handle using this every day in the best bed your salon has available more power to you.  I'm sure you'll be getting comments about how you look Mexican in no time; I'm always getting comments like that as it is but my ancestry is half European Jew so I have the olive complexion that gets dark fast already.  However; until you are used to this lotion...PLEASE BE CAREFUL.  I think people can actually hurt themselves with this one.  Make sure to drink plenty of water before going to tan with this one and of course don't spray any perfume or cologne directly on your skin before tanning or while letting the bronzers work for - hours after tanning.  Perfume and cologne absorbed through open pores can intensify heat sickness so just use common sense and be careful.  Also maybe the first couple times using this lotion go a little less on your usual time in the bed to see how you'll react (AGAIN THIS STUFF IS REALLY STRONG!)  One last warning for those who didn't notice the earlier warning lol; keep away from private areas...actually just keep it away from any sensitive areas of the body and all mucus membranes.  This lotion will get you dark but it won't do you any good if you kill yourself doing it; then you'll just look good in your casket (like you died on a tropical vacation!) =p  Happy tanning all. HOLY COW; THIS IS HOT!!!,Neutral
the smell is very perfumey but I love it also it is oh so hydrating and I even used it when I stopped tanning for awhile. It is hands down one of the most moisturizing after tan lotions I have ever used I also have semi sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin at all smells amazing!,sensitive skin
These were great foaming soaps for our family bathrooms. Even though they are marketed as a baby product we enjoyed them for family use in hand washing.The foaming makes for good clean hand washing with less mess than most liquid soaps. My kids tend to make a mess on the sink with some liquid soaps. This one makes for cleaner hand washing.I also liked the gentle scent. Strong perfume like scents really can bother my allergies and I am sensitive to strong smells. This was a nice gentle scent. Good Foaming Soap for Family Use,Neutral
This product really did the trick on my wavy frizzy bleached hair.  They have a tutorial on L'Oreal's website saying to put this from about the middle of your hair down.  I put it from about my ears down because my hair is down to my waist then whatever is left on my hands I quickly gloss over the top of my head trying not to get it near my part.  No greasiness and no frizz.  Some people have mentioned a strong odor I personally didn't find it to be that strong but if you are sensitive to perfumes in your hair products you might want to see if you can try this from a friend before you buy it. Love it,Neutral
These are no nonsense no perfume all purpose cotton rounds that don't leave any of those annoying little lint balls. I use them for astringent makeup remover cleaning my cats teeth and eyes. No perfumes or dyes. No fancy packaging. I love it. The cardboard container fits right under the sink. Economical and Convenient,Neutral

If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes for example a person wearing SPF can be exposed to the sun without reddening for  times longer -  minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of % plus certified organic ingredients and FREE OF; fragrances perfumes additives softeners thickening agents gums alcohol biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone Oxybenzone UV Chemical absorbers paraben phthalates PABA and  dioxane. BABO has % ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with .% ZO. But ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. ZO is like mud the higher the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so for many high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy. One needs to try different mixes to find the mix acceptable to them based on ingredients feel and performance. For a small investment sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn pain cancer medical bills pain killers etc. that come with skin exposure to the sun. Read Ingredients...,Neutral
The smell just isn't my favorite. I guess I like more sweet or fruity scents and this one is too musky and heavy. I'll wear it every now and again but I wouldn't repurchase it. Everyone says its a light perfume but every time I wear it I get a headache and no other perfume has done that to me. It's OK but I wouldn't repurchase,Neutral
I was able to purchase this perfume at a local citi trends clothing store! great deal! and it smells soooo good!It is a fruit smell very fruity almost like a grapefruit mixed with orange and sweet sugar I love it! the . ml bottle is BIG! this is more than enough perfume to last you a few months!!AWESOME!! LOVE IT!,Neutral
I must admit I had no expectations regarding this product. I bought it because there was a P&G; coupon here on Amazon. I must say I was pleasantly surprised!The product is a series of green and white layers which mix when dispensed. The result is a heavy cleaner with just enough abrasive power to clean without harming your face. The dispenser is a great pump that has a wide base and large pump head so it can be operated one handed.It rinses very easily leaving your face feeling really clean and refreshed. The smell is clean but not overwhelming so if you have issues with perfumed products this should be okay.  Note that this product is only  ounces so take that into account when doing a cost comparison.I usually buy only Neutrogena products; however the way my face feels after using this Olay cleaners will be added to my regimen especially this one. It is a keeper. Wonderful gentle cleanser,Neutral
This is a good scrub at a good price. The problem is the perfume smell is overpowering and sickening. I would not buy again because of the strong scent. I like the Philosophy scrub a lot better - it's more money but lasts longer and doesn't smell. Good product icky smell,Neutral
These have a nice soothing feeling. Removes my foundation easily as well as eye shadow but not mascara. The good thing is that the product isn't overly perfumed since that can irritate my asthma. Doesn't break me out. And it seems to moisturize  nicely.I'm having it sent every couple months automatically and love not needing to have to remember to pick it up. these won't remove your mascara but,Neutral
I use a L'Oreal waterproof mascara Revlon waterproof eyeliner and DermaBlend cover creme as my facial make-up.While the Olay cloths can remove the facial make-up - it fails horribly at taking off the eye make-up.I have to rub so very hard to remove the make-up that I'm worrying about damage to fragile eye skin.The cloth has some sort of perfume/chemical odor and burns my eyes for several minutes after use.I love all of my other Olay products so this was a big surprise for me. Perhaps the formula has changed to make it go from a product that so many have loved to one that I found to be disastrous. Perhaps Formula Has Changed?,Neutral
This is a very good mild facial scrub that you won't hesitate to use on a daily basis. Only a small dollop is needed for full coverage. There is a very mild citrus scent which is detectable for a few hours after use but is not heavy enough to be cloying. (I am sensitive to perfumes potpourri and the like and this cleanser did not bother me.) There are a modest amount of scrubbing beads in the product and these feel smooth on the face and there is no irritation after application. Once the scrub is washed off your face feels smooth and quite clean.My skin feels clean and refreshed after using the scrub and that is pretty much all I expect from a product of this sort.Recommended Very Good Daily Cleanser with Mild Scru,Neutral
Aveeno does not dissappoint!  I thought that since I have mildly sensitive skin this product might break me out but it did not.  In fact it made all of the little bumps on my arms go away and also cleared up some blemishes on my chin and neck area.  This scrub also smells wonderful-not perfumey just nice mild and clean smelling. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from mild blemishes.  I do not agree with the label that says this is a daily cleanser though...I would only suggest use it every couple of days or once a week.  Hope this helps! Excellent!,Neutral
Yah. I'm a guy. And I'm reviewing this - a woman's facial cleanser.  Well equal rights right?!?  This stuff doesn't scrub as much as I'd like.  If you're looking for a scrubby facial cleanser this ain't it.  It's a very gentle type of facial scrub.  Also - I found it to be heavily perfumed.  Like excessively so.  I mean - women wear enough crap already - perfumes makeup moisturizers etc.  All those smells can combine to smell like a giant mess. You don't need MORE fragrance on your face if you ask me.  This stuff made me smell like a girl.  So if you're a girl you'll probably like it.  I felt it was too strongly scented once my face was rinsed off.  I will use the whole tube - so if I notice better or worse shaving after using it I'll let you know.  Stay tuned kiddos... I'm a guy.,Neutral
This review is for Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum  Ounce. For what it is this product is satisfactory. Is it going to work miracles? No. However what it will do is to moisturize your skin giving it a more full supple appearance. It contains both retinol (i.e. Vitamin A) and glycerin which work together to lessen signs of aging moisturize and restore smoothness of skin. The texture and scent are pleasing with no greasiness or strong perfume odor. Neutrogena Wrinkle Serum,Neutral
I'm a licensed California esthetician and I typically buy only salon/spa type products for my skin. I had read some reviews on other sites about this new product and since it was an inexpensive Retinol product I decided to try it.I have always had very deep lines around my neck even as a kid. As I age (I'm now ) I am now battling lines on my chest forehead and my smile lines around my mouth and eyes. I thought sure I'll try this for the two weeks most people said where they saw the difference. I didn't expect much but thought it was worth a shot.Let me just tell this story; I was at a party last night talking to a woman in her s and at one point she mentioned that she kept meeting young people in their s and wanted to make older friends too. I said I had the same problem but I'm also more comfortable knowing who I am in my s. She stopped and her jaw dropped and she said WHAT? I thought you were ? I started laughing and yelled for my friend from across the room to make her repeat it! And that is when I went home and looked and YES this product is making a difference!My neck lines are much smaller and less deep. My forehead lines have almost completely vanished and my chest skin looks tight and soft. I can't believe it! In just two weeks! I put this on at night so I wasn't paying attention but I wish I'd taken a before and after!The bottle is nice and can be turned to close off which is great for travel and it's sturdy enough to handle being thrown into an overnight bag or purse. The cream smells really nice very mild scent and not perfumey and it spreads well and absorbs well into my skin. I don't feel oily or sticky at all.I've used glycolics so my skin is used to these types of products so I haven't felt any tingling or itchiness which is normal. If you do just mix it with a small amount of your regular night cream without an exfoliant or acid and use it that way. Or just every other night too. I use it every night on my face neck and chest. I think I just might be addicted.I have only written one other review for a skin care product before so this isn't my usual thing but I HAD to write this because it really works and the price is nice and it's just an overall great product. I'm very impressed. Good job Neutrogena! Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Lives Up to the Name,great product
I'm and have been using SPF  or better since I was  years old.  I've got really good skin but time eventually starts creeping up on you.  I've been using this for almost a year now now and I can't say it's a miracle worker but it definitely helps!  I'm mistaken for a  something regularly (haha!). I'll give this some credit but also being good about using sunscreen every day for  years :)).This is NOT a really moisturizing lotion so if you have dry skin you may want to combine it with a moisturizer.  I have normal to oily skin that tends to be sensitive and I've had no problems with this.  I use it with a spf  cream in the morning and at night I use a night cream in addition to this.Combine it with a weekly exfoliator (I use the neutrogena hand held one you use every other day) and you'll have a great combo (otherwise you may wind up with a few spots that are dry and flaky).All in all I'd say it's a good buy (and not overly perfumed IMO). Works well!,dry skin
What I liked about this product is:) Texture - non greasy which is rare to find in face cream.) Pump - I like the distribution method where I pump it into my palm) Good size and amountThe main thing I didn't like - and this might be just a bad or old batch - was the scent. My product smelled like over due perfume.In terms of how good this product is for my skin - I can't really tell but on the other hand when can you really tell? Great texture not sure my skin is better,Neutral
Always like to try new serums and it's usually difficult to come up with something to say about them...we all age and who's to say whether something slows the process or improves your look really?This feels quite nice when you put it on very silky almost like a liquid powder. It vanishes quickly and leaves your skin feeling softer. Just be sure not to use it as your only lotion. (The directions actually tell you to apply it under your usual lotion). If you do your skin will feel drier than usual...not that it will LOOK drier or flaky. We are using it with Neutrogena's hypoallergenic lotion (my partner) and Vaseline intensive (me).Feels fine & we think we see improvement after a couple weeks & isn't that the most you can ask?UPDATE: We stopped using this. It seems to add to problems with acne despite its not being a moisturizer. One of us is sensitive to perfumes & the scent here is strong. That could also be the problem.It was kind of like a foundation rather than a lotion. We'll take a pass on this. Kind of like powder--use with lotion!,Neutral
Very very good at removing makeup and not drying my skin.....it is a good non perfumery cleanser...try it.  It's a good one. I am almost  and it works for me and is very reasonably priced... Like this cleanser,Neutral
i like how gentle this feels and that it doesn't leave me skin feeling too dry.  the smell is nice.  not too perfumey. i use it nearly everyday,Neutral
I feel that because it is milder formula it does not work as well as regular RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.It is definitely gentler.I would like it more if it did not have strong perfumed smell.I just don't get it why do they have to scent products like this cream at all. It's OK.,Neutral
My wife and I both have fairly thick hair.  This shampoo does a great job of leaving it feeling clean and soft.  The fragrance is subtle and natural not an overwhelming chemical perfume.  I can't say much of anything about the color-preservative claim.  I haven't noticed any difference in my blond hair or my wife's chocolate-brown hair.  The shampoo leaves it soft and shiny and my wife doesn't get fly away hairs with this product.  In that respect it's similar to other Aveeno shampoo products we've used all of which have been pleasant alternatives to the industrial strength stuff. Another Aveeno Winner,Neutral
Background:I switched to this Aveeno Living Color shampoo from my what I have currently been using for the past few months Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions Frizzy to Smooth Shampoo. I have VERY thick long brown hair. I am  but started getting sporadic grey hair in my early 's. I have enough of it now that I dye my hair every  weeks with a deep brown hair color from  L'Or&eacute;al Paris Feria. Because I dye my hair such a dark color I can tell right away if the shampoo I am using is helping or hurting my hair color preservation. My hair is so thick that if I don't plan on curling it I need to flat iron it just to keep it under control.Differences:Scent:The Aveeno shampoo definitely does not have the same perfumey scent that Pantene shampoos have. You actually need to hold the Aveeno to your nose to detect any scent and the smell it does have it not the greatest. It doesn't smell bad but it's not going to make people say oh wow your hair smells greatTexture and performance:It feels thick like honey the hand. It also doesn't lather up to a bunch of foamy bubbles while washing your hair with it. However it cleans hair very well and leaves hair super smooth. This reminds me of a VERY EXPENSIVE shampoo I tried  years ago that had the same design. The shampoo was over $ for a small bottle and used in very high end salons. The shampoo was designed to help maintain expensive hair coloring and styles. I stopped using the pricey shampoo after I stopped spending $$$ a month at the salon to maintain my hair color. This shampoo is working just like the very expensive shampoo I use to use! It is keeping my deep hair coloring nice and dark but at a fraction of the price.Differences:One major difference I have discovered in using the Aveeno shampoo for thick hair vs the Pantene shampoo for thick hair is how my hair drys when I don't use a hair dryer. On days where I don't plan on going out I will sometimes just pull my hair back into a ponytail or up into a hair clip after my shower to save my hair an extra day from the damaging effects of blow drying and ironing. Usually (while using the Pantene) doing this would cause my hair to end up very frizzy and hard to brush through making me regret not blow drying it. The Aveeno shampoo instead makes my hair look just fine without blow drying it. It seems to tame it keeping it from looking wavy frizzy and out of control giving it a smooth and sleek appearance.Recommendations:I would recommend this shampoo for those with THICK hair who also color it and are looking to make their color last as long as possible. Fine hair thin hair and even some with medium hair will most likely NOT enjoy it's effects as they may find it makes their hair too limp and without body. I also highly recommend this shampoo for those who have long hair that sometimes would prefer not to blow dry it. Aveeno for thick hair vs Pantene for thick hair,Neutral
I colored my hair first because I wanted to try Aveeno Living Color Color Preserving shampoo with freshly colored hair so I could really tell if it made a difference. After several weeks of using Aveeno I can say that it did.I have had very little fading of my hair color. The Aveeno has a nice very light smell just clean smelling not perfume smelling at all. The biggest thing that I noticed was how soft my hair is. I have thick wavy coarse hair which I also color and straighten so soft is not usually a way I describe my hair but each time after using Aveeno my hair feels soft like a baby's. I can say that alone is worth sticking with Aveeno. I really like it and will be using again and again. Thanks Aveeno soft hair! Unexpected Benefit: Soft Hair,Neutral
This made my hair soft but it took a few uses to determine it was the reason I was sneezing had watery eyes and a headache. The scent is very strong (and bad!!) and it made me have miserable allergies due to the scent which stayed in my hair for several hours. If you have allergies to cheap perfume and cologne DON'T buy this. This is going in the garbage! Not for people with perfume allergies!,Neutral
This is just not a very exciting shampoo.  It has a strong perfumey scent and it did leave my hair very clean.  I found that a little went a long way and that I had to use only about half of this product that I normally do.  I guess my hair color looks good when I use it.  So as far as performance it was fine but I definitely wouldn't pay extra for this product.I have no idea why it is billed as Aveeno Naturals because looking at the ingredient list there didn't seem to be anything particularly natural about them.  Comparing it to the ingredient list of my Nature's Gate shampoo there was no contest.  This product is just chock full of chemicals.Basically I wouldn't bother spending the extra money on this product as it just doesn't seem to have enough going for it to merit it. Nothing special,long way
I have always been a fan of most Neutrogena products especially when I am not able to purchase the more expensive brands such as Kiehls.  There is no obnoxious scent or perfume odor.  Just a neutral facial cleanser that works up into a nice lather.  The lather easily cleanses the face as it claims at least mine and I get that nice clean feeling afterwards.  There is only a hit of firming effects but I am not at an age where that is a concern for me so all the better.  Nothing worse than having an over the top tight feeling that accompanies many facial cleaners.  Good choice Love It,Neutral
One of my main requirements in a facial cleanser is that it NOT have a heavy perfume-y smell because it seems like my skin cannot tolerate those types and the smells often make me nauseous.  I was very happy when I received this in the mail and opened it up to give it a sniff test.  It does have a very light pleasant smell but it is not heavily perfumed.I have used this twice a day (morning and night) on my combination skin.  It does a very thorough job of cleaning off my make-up although I haven't really used it around my eyes.  I use a special eye make-up remover for that.  I have tried make-up remover pads on my face after using this product and the pads come away clean so it seems like it is doing a good job of removing make-up and oil from my face.  I rinse with plain water and I cannot detect any soapy residue left on my skin.  My skin has not been irritated or had any unusual breakouts from this product.If you are looking for a natural product facial cleanser I would recommend that you give this one a try.

I was SO HAPPY when I discovered this in the isles of Walmart. A natural face cleanser with the Neutrogena name? Brilliant. I checked out the ingredient list of course and then impulsively purchased it. All the ingredients are plant-derived except for one (I think. I don't have the bottle with me). It has a liquid (more on the gel side than the water-y side) consistency and a weird smell - not bad but definitely shouldn't be made into a perfume anytime soon. Some days I would dilute it a bit with water and some days I wouldn't but I always got the same results in the shower: stinging and after the shower: not that great.It wasn't a horrible cleanser (my face did feel clean) but it didn't give me results that I wanted. It made my combination skin quite flaky and greasy...not oily but greasy and while it cleared some whiteheads on the sides of my face it gave me acne on my neck...It was weird. I don't like it but I will have to try the other products before I can completely discard this one as I really liked that the packaging was green (the ink was printed onto the bottle and not paper on top of the bottle). And if I remember right the ink was made of soy. But I could be wrong. Overall it was just a weird experience. Weird.,Neutral
The one thing I can depend on Neutrogena is to come out with skin products that make you feel good.  I've been using their soaps on and off since I was a teenager and have never been disappointed.  The Naturals line is something new and I was very curious to try it.  I have been using it the past week and I just love the way it feels.  It's a very light soap lightly scented (not overpowering and not perfumey -it has more of a woodsy scent).  I use it once a day at night (I use another Neutrogena product in the mornings) and while it is not harsh I feel it is doing a good job with cleaning off residual makeup and dirt left on my skin after I have used my makeup remover.  I would definitely buy this product again.  Highly recommended. I love all their products!,Neutral
I love this face soap. It is creamy lathers up really well and leaves the skin soft. Most facial cleansers either make my face feel stripped of all moisture or greasy.Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser  fl. ozs (Pack of )does neither.I usually have to use cleanser made for sensitive skin because I react to perfumes and harsh chemicals. This facial cleanser felt wonderful on my skin after several uses and I had no negative reactions to it.I would definitely purchase this product again for both me and my pre-teen daughter. Fresh wonderful gentle clean,sensitive skin
Let me say upfront that I'm past the zit age.  Well past it.  And even when I was a teenager they were few and far between.  So when I tell you that the morning after I first used this cleanser I woke up with a huge zit on my cheek you will understand why my first thought was Great Godfrey Daniels what did that stuff do to me? Possibly I was just experiencing some kind of deep cleansing action... bringing problems to the surface... whatever.  It hasn't happened again -- for which I remain grateful -- and my skin looks and feels good so that's really what counts.What I like about it is that it doesn't dry my skin out and it doesn't smell like cheap perfume.  What I don't like is that it doesn't really lather very well and it does leave some dirt which a quick swipe with toner and a cotton ball will show.  Both of these issues are minor compared to the fact that it contains no parabens pthalates or any other icky and potentially dangerous chemicals.  Whether all the added vitamins and botanicals help my skin... well that's hard to judge.  All I can say for sure is that I don't mind using it and my skin says thanks when I do.  That's good enough for me. It must be doing something!,dry skin
It's a nice lotion with the following good properties:. Doesn't smell (at all no fragrance in it). This is very important since I don't like anything smelly on me even if the smell is not lasting.. Truly safe to use on the face: most stuff I've tried plugs pores and gives you pimples (except for L'Oreal's aftershave). This is great and rare.. Has no greasiness at all nor does it leave a waxy layer on your skin. It basically dries up quickly and disappears there's nothing unusual about the skin after you apply this thing after a minute or two.. Just as they claim it's nice on all body parts. I used in on my face (both after shaving and not) hands arms and legs: all worked fine.. No parabens in the ingredients (also quite rare still).. Cheap enough to be used liberally all over your body.Bad properties: none that I can see (so far; will update this review if anything transpires).Bottom line: good stuff recommended. After trying a million things most of them much more expensive I settled on just a few options: L'Oreal aftershave this thing here and Cetaphil (a bit waxy but otherwise also very good).Btw I just saw it in Wegman's for five-ninety-nine on sale (regular six-ninety-nine; both better than current price here). Always check local prices: don't assume online prices are best. They often aren't.PS. Thanks to commenter LazyChick: indeed I overlooked that there are two kinds of this thing and that bebeblah reviewed the other perfumed version: mea culpa; apologies to bebeblah; I edited the review.//: discovered a flaw: doesn't preserve very well -- I just tossed a couple of bottles of it because they developed a strange musty smell over this summer. No change in consistency or color but smell is strange so I assume something went wrong in it. No parabens has its costs I guess. No problem during the winter but in the summer it goes bad. Maybe I need to keep it in the fridge? Something to try. Good on all accounts,Neutral
Smells nice but not overpowering has high SPF and Neutrogena is a good brand. I use it whenever I plan to spend some longer time outside. The scent is nice but still can use a perfume. It goes on slightly white but becomes clear. Will definitely purchase again. GREAT SUNBLOCK,Neutral
I am not sure how my daughter feels about the perfume but she was thrilled with such a cute bottle. She did take a sliht smell and said it seemed nice. Purchased because of bottle,Neutral
I love perfume and love sampling and trying new ones! This sounded good.. But not for me! It's very strong and smells like the little bars of soap from a hotel you get and my husband said it was awful and not pretty.. So a no go :( but they did ship fast and good if you decide to buy! Not for me,Neutral
Bottle was less than the price of a  oz in the store so fabulous bargain!!!  The bottle is big solid heavy and adorable.  The perfume itself I found to be fairly typical of the spread offered at Walgreens or the like.  It's not a BAD perfume though I did find it to be a bit vanilla-y and floral for my tastes even though vanilla was fairly far down on the list of notes.  It was the first thing I picked up.  It may just be how it's reacting to my personal body chemistry.  It  also leans on the generic side...I really don't think I'd be able to pick this out of a line up of scents.  It's not  long lasting either but I expected that. You would have to spritz it on your clothing rather than skin to get a good wear time.  I have quite an extensive collection and I've found that the celebrity endorsed perfumes (Britney Spears Paris Hilton Halle Berry Beyonce etc) are all wonderful scents but the staying power is a bit short compared to say Clinique Happy Heart or Chanel.  This is made by Coty who makes some great scents (one of my all time drugstore favorites was Ghost Myst!)  but with little potency.  Even though I wasn't over the moon about the perfume itself it does smell good and is totally wearable.  Combine that with the awesome price it's offered for through the Amazon warehouse (I paid $ with shipping for a .oz) and the fantastic display value of the bottle itself...I do like this and would recommend it.  I will likely order Katy Perry's Meow as well just because I am so thrilled with the value and the bottle...and it may turn out Meow is more to my tastes. FABULOUS deal!  Adorable bottle!  Perfume fairly typical.,Neutral
I. LOVE. THIS. PERFUME. lol i smells really nice. its kind of floral-y and it smells really sophisticated. the only problem i have with it is the fact that it DOES NOT last on my skin at all. idk why tho. so it might last really long on your skin. so give it a try  :) Beautiful Scent!!!,Neutral
I admit it. I was first attracted by the adorable cat perfume bottle - I really really wanted it! However I couldn't find any stores locally that sell the perfume so I could smell it. Fortunately I received this as a gift and I am very pleased.  The bottle is even better in person than online and it is much bigger than I expected.  I have uploaded a picture of it next to a mass market paperback book and they are almost the same height.  The scent was also a pleasant surprise. I prefer fruity sweet fragrances.  This one is fruity but with a musky undertone.  It's not easy to describe a scent but I'd say this is a more mature fruity as opposed to the bubble gum fruity of stuff like Love's Berry Sweet (which I also wear).  Plus unlike other fruity splashes that fade away in less than  minutes this has lasted over  hours and still has a nice scent.Overall I really like this fragrance.  And I find myself being tempted by Katy's Meow scent in a similar bottle... love the bottle love the scent,Neutral
I am in love with the cat bottle as well as the perfume. I am looking to try Meow to see if it is as good as Purr. Very satisfied.  :) Love it!,Neutral
Picked up a bottle of this perfume for my wife for Christmas this year. She thinks it's great and so does the rest of the family. The cool-looking bottle is just a bit of icing on the cake. I would definitely recommend this product to women or to guys who are out looking for a gift for thier lady-friend(s) or sister(s)! Cool-looking bottle and great scent that both turn heads!,Neutral
I was really excited about this. The bottle is soooo flipping cute that I almost can't stand it. It's very original. However I don't feel that the scent is original at all. I'm not going to say it smells bad or anything because it doesn't. But the smell just reminds me of a lot of perfumes. There's a generic smell to drug store perfumes that this is very close to. So a huge part of me just can't justify it. I paid for a pretty bottle with a generic scent... Scent's will pick up differently on everyones skin. On my skin it smells mostly fruity powdery. The scent does change through the day which is interesting. I like more what it smells like hours after having it on haha but I'm afraid this is just a cute decoration to have and I suppose support for Katy haha Cute Bottle Okay Scent,Neutral
I love how sweet and gentle this perfume smells! I am very picky about the scents I wear especially since my family members are allergic to most perfumes out there but this one just works with me. I am not saying that the scent is for everyone just mentioning that I love it. For the price and how large it is? This is an amazing deal! Celebrity perfumes are extremely expensive let alone retail markups! I was almost surprised when I opened this up because I expected something smaller like you see at the stores but this will last me a long time! Amazon is the online Costco of the world :) Great Price and Size,long time
I just reviewed a &#;touchable finish&#; spray by Cristophe and linked back to this Suave spray as a comparison - and then discovered that I never wrote a review here. I have been using this spray for several months and am very happy with it. I have tried more expensive sprays - and am willing to pay the premium if I found something I felt was worth it. While Elnett and Sebastian are setting the standard in the salon industry these days they are at least x more expensive than the Suave Professionals and IMHO not worth the price. This spray holds just as well while leaving your hair &#;touchable&#; as the more expensive sprays. I only dropped a star because of the fragrance - I prefer unscented sprays and although this is mild it is still a bit sweet for me. But the scent doesn't linger and won't interfere with your own perfume so it's only a minor nuisance. A great product at a great price... Salon quality product at a great price,great product
I love the hairspray.  I think it gives a moderately-firm hold without looking like you sprayed glue on your head.  My husband says the hold isn't strong enough but it's because he also uses a firm hold gel so his frame of reference is different and he's holding a tight haircut vs. long locks.  For women's bangs and curls it will hold them without making them look plastic.  I like the smell too it's light and fresh and dissipates quickly so it won't interfere with your perfumes or other products. Moderately-firm hold good smell nice misty spray.,Neutral
I usually buy Sheer Twilight but I was looking to try something different and decided to give the Scarlet Blossom a shot.  The texture lather and scent are all really nice and the price can't be beat.  Although I really like the subtle scent that lingers on my skin afterward it is strongly scented out of the bottle. For that reason I can only use it occasionally so as not to become turned off.  I recommend it if you're not too sensitive to strongly perfumed body washes (or if you are only use it occasionally like I do). Nice but overpowering at times.,Neutral
I didn't like this.  I received it with a broken top but still decided to use it.  I didn't like the smell it interferred with my perfume. Vaseline Body Lotion,Neutral
The plum and sakura blossom is a nice scent. It does smell a little bit like perfume but it's not too overpowering. Dove,little bit
I bought this a few weeks ago when I was looking for a new body wash.  I was hesitant about trying it because I tend to have oily skin and was afraid this would make me break out.  I was plesantly suprised when it didn't break me out and my skin is actually more clear after using it for a few weeks.  I cannot stand heavily perfumed body washes and this one is not overwhelming.  Although it was a bit on the pricy side compared to what I normally use I will continue to use this in the future. New favorite body wash,Neutral
While I don't usually like an unscented body lotion I do like this one. It moisturizes very well and is not greasy at all. The moisturization lasts all day even on rough patches. It does have a VERY faint smell to it not enough to call it scented though and it is not a perfumey smell. The price was great here at Amazon which is what prompted me to buy. I am glad I tried it. Moisturizing,Neutral
I keep coming back to Vaseline lotions the quality is great and the price is right. Fancy scented lotions are a rip off in my opinion....get a lotion to care for your skin spend money on a good perfume (not cologne or body sprays) if you want to add scent. Est&eacute;e Lauder has a nice range find one that fits you :) Forget all the others,Neutral
I was looking for a roller perfume that didn't cost an arm and a leg and was small enough to fit into my bag so I can refresh my scent throughout the day and came across this product.  It smells very musky and calming which I like and makes me feel fresher. Smells divine,Neutral
This perfume smells very very nice! I have had A LOT of compliments on it. I don't know if it is true that these oils smell different on people but for me personally I would buy it again. LOVE!,Neutral
every time i wear this scent i can't keep my husband off of me!...and i'm not even wearing makeup and i need to brush my teeth first!!!  if i go to the grocery store after applying this perfume i have men asking me what isle is the pasta on or for my phone number.  i have now labled this product to be used with the utmost discrestion.  powerful stuff!!!! ;-) this is a secret weapon!,Neutral
Very nice we love this perfume.Long lasting  good smell and we are regularly buyer of Auric Blends products.-HP Very nice perfume,Neutral
This is one of the most fabulous perfume oils that I've ever purchased!!! It smells like I think angels would smell.......if they have a smell....Just heavenly. I would certainly purchase again.... Auric Blend-Love,Neutral
I literally smelled like moth balls and cheap perfume--It just isnt my scent. I am sure that it would be appealing to others but unfornately not me Just not for me...,Neutral
I like it but scent go away in  min .  smells very soft but u can  notice that it is oil - not just perfume- it has that distinct oil scent I like it but scent go away in  min,Neutral
I get compliments every single time I wear Love. Egyptian Goddess is second in line. I used to pay up to $ for perfume and there is no reason. The oils I buy from Auric smell beautifully and stay with me throughout the day. Best perfume I have ever owned,Neutral
I Love the Dove body wash in this scent but in the deodorant it has too much perfume and it gives off a sweet chemical scent. Also after a couple of uses it all crumbled apart. Do not buy this. Broke inside the plastic & smells like chemicals.,Neutral
I bought it relying on the reviews I read.... well we all have different taste so in short the perfume is in a nice bottle smells simply ok but is more suitable for elder women I guess... I am  and cannot use it (not because it's strong but it reminds me of old perfumes smell from s that my mom used to spray on). will give it out as a present. it's ok,Neutral
How much do I love Queen Latifah and her perfumes. Queen of Hearts smells so good and it lasts all day which I love so much. Thank you Queen Latifah keep those perfumes coming! You got yourself one loyal customer! Soo yummy,Neutral
I'm a Queen Latifah fan and have been wanting to try her perfume. This scent is very nice but I felt was too old for me. I like more sweet scents but that's just my personal perfume preference. My mother though really liked this scent. It just depends on want you enjoy. But all in all great price for a perfume. Womenly scent,Neutral
people ask me what i am wearing it smell good and last all day i even bought her other perfumes they all smell real good i love it,Neutral
I have tried several different products to tame my colored and heat damaged hair. I've tried too many leave in products that just weigh my hair down and make it oily. Most shampoos that I use leave my hair more dry than before I showered which sucks because my hair needs to be shampooed every day or it will be super oily. With this product I don't have to worry about that I can even comb through my hair when it's still wet. Plus it smells AMAZING. I couldn't believe it it smells more like a good perfume than a shampoo. My boyfriend loves it. I got this product in a department store for $. but it was worth every penny. I will definitely be buying this over and over again. John Freida Full Repair Shampoo,Neutral
Been wearing this perfume I really love it and I did it realize how big the bottle was but it will last me a while and it stays on a long time it smells so good iam not just saying this they have this at Kohls so I have smelled this before this was a great buy and a great size bottle for my money the seller was fast this is my other favorite perfume know and the bottle is pretty to you get your moneys worth for get designers perfume this is just as good and can afford. Seller did a wonderful job packaging it came in the mail as in the picture awesome perfume another winner for me that's why I keep coming back to amazon I get my moneys worth on here. I love this perfume must have,favorite perfume
This perfume smells okay not very similar to the original and wears off very quickly. Not happy with this product....I'll just give it to my neice or something. Smells okay but wears off very fast....,Neutral
This perfume smells just absolutely lovely!! It has a lite sweet/floral to it. the bottle is just so cute I put it on my dresser so it could stand out lol. I spray it everywhere! I love it!!! La Vida Loca Smells Very Good!,Neutral
the smell is ok i have an impression body spray of the real perfume aswell and it smells better then this. i just wish it was a bit sweeter like the body spray i have. the bottle was cute. my grama said it was a cute bottle to. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone though. its good as an air freshener. i spray it around my room. the scent doesnt last long either. oh well. i had better impressions. eh...,Neutral
I know that it must be kind scary to buy these type of perfumes but let's be honest when they do a right product I really don't care for the name but for what my friend will be smelling like. I mean you wear this perfume but most people would love it or the way it does smell but they really don't know if is the real deal or not so this is great. I am going for what I got not for what is in the stores. also it was fast delivery... once again.. great..,Neutral
Smells NOTHING like viva la juicy in ANY way possible. I was very disappointed with this purchase. It smelled so heavy and gross. It was very bad. Sometimes even if the impression doesn't really smell like the real thing it at least still kinda smells good. This does not lol. Like a completly different perfume itself,Neutral
i  love it it is light want buy real perfume  it good for pricebuy and wear everyday cheap price for money clean i love smell,Neutral
I recently ordered this perfume which smells close to the same thing. it is a little off but you have to remember that it is after all only an imitation of the real deal. The seller i purchased it from was not so honest about it though as it was way smaller than the size i ordered. I would probably purchase this perfume again but not through the same seller as i don't want to have another disappointing experience. perfume is great but beware of seller,Neutral
I purchased this from bestseller. It arrive quickly and undamaged. My impression of this impression of Vera Wang's Princess Precious was very good. I can't say how it compares to Princess because I have yet to smell it. The bottle and cap are quite plain as you may expect from an inexpensive perfume. But the spray applicator functions very well.The reason I have rated this  stars is because of the scent. It has an initial smell of cotton candy vanilla and a fresh cool rain. They combine very well to make an unmistakably friendly fresh feminine and outgoing type of fragrance. The scent is sweet but by no means overly sweet. After about an hour on the skin it had transformed to include rose as the cotton candy faded. The cool rain remained but became less noteworthy and gave more of a background freshness. The vanilla remained consistent. Ended fresh with a subdued sweetness with equal parts rose cotton candy and vanilla. Different pleasing evolves very nicely on the skin.,Neutral
I performed a side by side comparison of this PRECIOUS perfume with the original PRINCESS by Vera Wang and the result is not bad at all.This bottle is in a pretty heart shape and the fragrance has a staying power.  First spray will not smell anything like the original since impressions of original fragrances would contain more alcohol -- so wait a few seconds for the dry down.  This PRECIOUS fragrance dries down to a soft powdery scent just like the PRINCESS fragrance except that PRINCESS is  sweeter and stronger. However despite being weaker I have to say that I fell in love with this scent it's so soft and fresh ... hints of sweet vanilla lingers without being overwhelming just like PRINCESS.The price is unbelievable especially if you are used to buying quality fragrances at almost a hundred dollars (some are even over). I am giving this  stars since it is a wonderful fragrance at a superb value! SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON WITH PRINCESS by VERA WANG,Neutral
I was restocking some old faves to feed my Auric Blends body oil addiction and was feeling adventurous and decided to try something new.  My initial impression was YUCK! this is going in the trash.  Well took another chance and put some behind my ears.  Cut to  hours later doing some cardio at the gym and I'm thinking that someone sure does have some nice perfume......yeah it was me.  Try it.  You may be surprised.UPDATEIt's been a week and I must say this stuff is kind of awesome.  It changes so drastically when worn compared to the horrible smell in the bottle.  My husband who hates Patchouli told me he really loves the smell which was a big surprise to me.  It mixes nicely with most other oils it adds a touch of earthy to anything sweet or musky. Surprised,Neutral
I believe the lotion I got is fake. I have been an avid tanner for about  years & I have tried all sorts of lotions. The consistency of this lotion is watery & there is no berry smell but a light perfume like smell. Putting it on my face it felt like Vaseline. The back of my lotion where JWOW's signature is her name in full cursive. On the Amazon items display photo it is just a large pink J.My local tanning salon has limited lotions so I am not able to compare lotions. I will stop by in a tanning store later & compare & of course I will always update my review.***This lotion DOES NOT expire. The date on the bottom is the batch number & manufacture date. I have confirmed this with Amazon.If I am wrong about anything I have said above I really would like to know. I asked a question of knowing how to tell if the product is authentic or not.*Like all my reviews I'm not looking to argue or point fingers. Of course I'm upset that I believe the item I received is fake but that is what replies are for! Thanks guys. Fake?,Neutral
I like this perfume it's very different. But a little too fruity for me. Something about the smell was always a little off for me. But on the plus side the perfume smell does last  exceptionally longer than most. long lasting perfume,Neutral
At first I thought this was going to be strong and I hate strong perfume and mad that I didn't smell the apples or peaches but this really smells good and smells better once it dies down. I wish I had got the larger bottle. At first,Neutral
I have been using this product for years and hope to continue using it for years to come.This is wonderful on the skin. It is pure and simple. OK it does have a strong perfume that you have to get used to but that doesn't take long (if you give it a chance).I give it five stars with no hesitation. Great stuff!,Neutral
This Agadir Argan Oil Moisture Masque is an awesome product! The Argan Oil must be the secret for soft shiny and healthy looking hair. The fragrance is like non other and I love it! I don't need to wear any perfume with these products because their fragrance is awesome by itself! Wonderful Treatment,argan oil
My biggest complaint is the tube is too heavy and hard to get the product out an issue for somebody with arthritis and small hands.My biggest positives are several good spread works instantly holds the itching down for hours.  For me this smelled like a strong cheap lilac so I replaced it with a  ounce unscented version in a very easy to use pump.The bottom line this works better for treating a  year eczema condition than any OTC product I've used before.  My legs used to be a big issue now they have healed up nicely with this product and I am praying for the same miracle in my arms.  I put this on my arms from biceps to wrists x daily and wash my arms off between applications this keeps my condition at bay a huge improvement for me. works well annoying container a little too much perfume for a man,Neutral
I can't even comment on how well this product moisturizes because the smell is so disgusting bitter and downright funky that I haven't been able to keep it on for more than  minutes. No perfume will cover it up either. Unfortunately this smells horrible,Neutral
I couldn't get past the smell in order to use the product. Perfumes colognes or any flowery type aroma leaves me with migraines. If your sensitive to smells pass this by. Good news is the seller was very gracious allowing me to return it. Too much smell,Neutral
I have only used this product one time and already see results. I have guttate psoriasis so I break out every few years and although mine is already clearing on it's own I can definitely see how people with chronic psoriasis love this stuff. It did sting my psoriasis spots but that only lasted a minute or two. Lets face it it's salt there will be a stinging sensation in spots that aren't normal skin. However I immediately noticed that my skin was unbelievably smooth. There was no drying but I did put a lotion on afterwards. I used BWC lotion which is perfume free etc. as although people with psoriasis are supposed to use HEAVY moisturizers I can not because the greasy feeling irritates my skin. bwc is a thick moisturizer that is not greasy  so the sea salt and lotion mix was like heaven for my skin. I am very excited to see results after a week of tanning and sea salt baths. Also my skin has a nice glow to it and I can run my fingers across my psoriasis spots and it feels like normal skin no irritation. As an added note I did extensive heavy research on which brand of sea salt to buy. I'm happy to say I picked the right company to purchase from because the salt is the real deal! Look no where else if you one the real deal this is it. Baby smooth soft skin,Neutral
After radiation treatment for cancer my body became extremely sensitive to bubble baths and perfumes. I have a bath almost every day so what to do? These bath salts are wonderful. I add a couple of drops of an essential oil and the salts soften the water and my sensitive skin.I will be purchasing this in future to replace the bubble baths I've always used. Just what a body needs,Neutral
I rubbed a little on my dry ends of hair and in my hands. It is powerful enough to substitute for perfume. It's a nice option in the bathroom to have a scented oil for dry skin and hair. I wouldn't use it every day This smells lovely,dry skin
I'm typically somewhat irritated with coconut oil as a moisturizer. It doesn't rub in easily and it feels heavy. But this melts immediately when you start rubbing it in and it seems to absorb considerably better than straight up coconut oil from a jar.And this stuff smells good enough to eat. It has a rich vanilla smell with a hint of real gardenias (and this is the only product with any sort of flower smell that I can stand to wear--because it doesn't smell perfume-y or fake). And the smell lasts much longer than any other conventional lotion I use. I've had people get comically excited over what lotion I'm wearing. The stuff smells that delightful. The smell!,Neutral
I used this all last winter and never had an episode of chapped hands or cuticle prolems. It is not greasy and readily absorbs into your skin. No perfume scent - which I love. I don't need to look any further for a different hand cream. Best hand cream!,Neutral
I like this hand cream but I doubt I would repurchase it. I like to try new things and I guess it is time to move on. Also I like perfumed hand creams and this one has no perfume. Like it,Neutral
my wife's favorite perfume EVER. Got it first at Kohl's with a % off coupon but the bottle was smaller and the price was still slightly higher than what we paid for this BIG bottle.  Not too strong not too floral not musky very appealing.  She gets compliments ALL the time. GREAT price big bottle awesome perfume!,favorite perfume
This product is excellent. My hair is so shine...I love it...I use daily and my hair don't stay sticky or heavy. And the perfume it's so delicious. Perfect,Neutral
I really love the smell and my husband does too. If there was a perfume of this smell I would totally buy it. I also use the shampoo and deep conditioner then this and it works really great. I'm thinking of buying the oil after this is done. Would definitly purchase again. This smells great,Neutral
During the Christmas rush I went to Macy's to buy one of my sisters' a particular perfume. While there I was able to smell a few others (some I liked some I definitely didn't) and Rebelle was one of them. I knew I wasn't going to buy it there for I wasn't at the store to buy myself something and I am one who does compare shopping. Anyway while I had a scent I had sprayed on my wrist (which I am going to eventually buy but Gucci can be expensive) I had sprayed Rebelle on one of those hard papers they give you and I was totally undecided on whether I would be interested in buying it or not. I liked it but I didn't. I was really unsure about it. However I did not see Reb'L there to try which could have been for a factor of reasons since there were tons of people there.Less than two weeks ago I went to Walgreens and they had all of their Christmas stuff marked off. They had some perfumes half off and Reb'L Fleur (a . ounce or . ounce though probably . ounce) was on sale for $! I couldn't pass that offer especially since it was random finding it there anyway for I don't recall finding perfumes like that on the regular. I honestly really like this scent! It surprised me because I didn't want to like it but it had something that Rebelle did not have and I'm actually glad I go it at that size. I wish they sold those sizes of perfumes more in stores so you do not have to commit to a huge . ounce or whatever else in case you do not like it. To me it is a sophisticated Oriental scent which isn't overpowering at all so I am comfortable wearing it at work. I also think anyone would be comfortable wearing this scent. I'm  and I would wear it at  or . It's not a bad scent at all.I will say that it may not last as long as some people may desire or want. It doesn't totally disappear but it does considerably lighten depending on how long you wear it throughout the day. However I just may be over thinking it for there are times where I have still smelled it the next day in clothes or whatever but that is different than body chemistry. A Surprising Yes,Neutral
I love trying new perfumes and thought this sounded like a great scent... No it's not :( sprayed on wrist and it's so strong and bitter I got a headache! :( washed off and it still lingered.. Not pretty scent and not attractive.. The bottle is the only neat thing and it was packaged great.. Not for me,Neutral
I had heard from a friend that this perfume smelled nice so I bought it on a whim to see for myself.  I am not a huge fan of all these random celebrities coming out with perfumes that all start to smell the same.  This one is a total exception!  It smells so sexy and classy at the same time.  It lasts all day long and smells very expensive.  I am in love with it.  The bottle is very unique as well. So Amazing:),Neutral
smells fresh. not too strong which can make peoples sinuses act up. nice price for this perfume. I would buy again. love the light smell,Neutral
I received a sample of this perfume when making a purchase at a local dept store. The sample was a dime-sized plastic disc encased in a slightly larger cardboard placard. Waiting until the following morning when I had not applied any perfume yet for the day I snapped open the top of this sample and dabbed  tiny dots on each my wrists to see if I would like it but most of all to determine if the scent would cause my husband's allergies to kick in. We were both amazed at how wonderfully feminine and light this scent is without being overpowering or triggering his allergies. Not only that but those few dabs on my wrists lasted all day throughout the night and into the following morning although by morning the scent was lighter. That alone amazed me that such a small amount would last so long especially when my hands are in water all day long with the family handwashing dishes and  dogs - I'm always washing my hands!The scent is named Rebel Flower but neither of us thought it smelled overly flowery. I can identify a hint of vanilla (maybe) and some musk and maybe sandlewood. Not sure but just know we both liked it so much and a teeny bit lasted so long I bought the spray the other day. Couldn't wait for it to arrive.Gotta say I'm a bit disappointed. When I saw the size of the spray bottle I thought to myself Self this is going to last a very long time but I doubt that now. I found myself reapplying this spray almost every - hours: it faded so quickly. Hubby kept hovering close by and mentioned a few times he could no longer smell the scent either even when leaning close and purposely inhaling. And as soon as I washed my hands/wrists after an application the scent was gone. I don't know if perhaps the tiny samples are a stronger formula to get us hooked but the sample and the spray bottle certainly do not equate to each other.I'll continue using it but once it is gone I'm pretty sure I'll stick with my 'usual' scent. I'd rather pay top dollar for a scent that lasts all day than pay this high price for a scent that isn't any longer-lasting than a room freshening spray.Edit: Aug  It has been a few months and I'm getting to the bottom of the spray bottle. I have to say I love the bottle design; reminds me a genie bottle. However once the perfume is about / gone spraying or spritzing this becomes a bit of a challenge. The top of the spray bottle is slender and sleek while the bottom acts like a paper weight. It is hard to hold and even harder to hold one handed and spray as when it was new. I find myself holding it with two hands to apply it and then it is pretty difficult to get it where you want it. If I set it on the counter and try spraying with one hand the bottle walks along the counter my finger slips off the spray nozzle and the bottle tips over. Just to be able to use it to the last drop my hubby now holds the bottle for me tightly in two hands and I reach over and spray myself. Just doesn't seem worth all this work. I won't buy this again. Too many other new scents out there to try rather than go through this each time. Lovely scent but not exactly what I expected,long time
This perfume smells like a very expensive perfume. I had a sample of it and after wearing the sample decided to buy a full bottle. Thank you Amazon for selling this perfume for such a good price. It's soft but has a presence. I have very bad allergies so I have to pick my perfumes very carefully. I have no problem with this one. Love the smell of this perfume and the price,Neutral
This product really does make hairy shiny and smooth. Love the natural ingredients. The scent to me is very pleasant very natural though not perfume like. It has almost a sweet grassy clean scent. frizz eliminator and shine enhancer,Neutral
Finally a different perfume that I love I always tend to wear the same one this is perfect! thanks marc jacobs finally,Neutral
I first sniffed this beautiful scent in . Since then I have purchased  more bottles. I love fruity sweet scents that are still fresh and have some mystery in them. This is the perfect fit. I have tried the other Daisies (eau de perfume eau de toilette) but this one is the winner.If you like Escada summer scents CK Euphoria Lancome La vie est belle and are looking for a summer scent... THIS IS THE ONE! LOVELY SUMMER SCENT,Neutral
I may like this fragrance even more than the original Daisy scent. I'm usually not one for these warm floral perfumes but there is something about Daisy Eau So Fresh that I just love. It's playful feminine and fun. I highly recommend it. Love it,Neutral
Firstly the packaging of this product is wonderful. If you've bought Marc Jacobs perfume before then you're probably used to his marvelous package designs. If not you're in for a treat. I bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. It is also a wonderfully refreshing fragrance with a hint of floral. This makes a great gift and also a lovely perfect to own yourself. Wonderful Perfume,Neutral
This is one of my favorite perfumes!It smells soooooo good! It's definitely a lot softer than the original Marc Jacobs Daisy... I recommend this one instead. It's soft girly and floral. Lasts several hours and not that this matters THAT much but...the bottle is so cute! and you can also save some money and buy the . bottle and it will last you a while. smells AMAZING,Neutral
I've been searching for a new perfume since my old favorite was discontinued. I'll admit to being influenced by cute bottles and this perfume definitely has that.I like the scent of this it's very fresh and clean right out of the bottle. It's floral without being musky. However the scent changes a bit once it's applied to my skin. I realize different people's body chemistries can be different so this may not happen for everyone. And the changed scent on my skin is still good just altered a little. So if you are considering this perfume you may want to try to get ahold of a sample or use a tester bottle at a store first.I find that this lasts for a few hours. By the end of the day it's pretty faint unless I hold my wrist up to my nose!Also this does not impact my rating but please check out the seller feedback carefully before purchasing. It seems as though some sellers may be offering counterfeit product especially in the larger-sized bottles. really like the scent wish it lasted just a bit longer,Neutral
This is hands down my favorite perfume of all time--reminds me of gum drops and flowers. The scent is unbelievably beautiful and light but lasts for several hours. I purchased  other perfumes within a week's time of receiving this one in the mail and wish that I would have splurged a little more for the large bottle of Eau So Fresh because it is the only one I really care to wear. This is a fragrance that is made for all women. Even if you prefer more musky strong scents and especially if you are a fan of sweet scents GIVE THIS ONE A TRY. I promise you will not be disappointed. I am an extremely picky perfume wearer but this one will most definitely stay in rotation for quite some time. LOVE in an bottle,Neutral
I started out with the perfume and then ordered the cream in order to layer. I love it. It softens without leaving a greasy feeling to the skin. The smell is heavenly very unusual. I just wish it came in a larger container!! Love it!,Neutral
I love this lotion!  It's a slightly dark scent which is definitely what I'm into.  Not too sweet and a little more rock and roll.  For a lotion it's very perfume-heavy so this is not for the faint of heart.  I personally love that because it stays around more and lasts longer.  The packaging is adorable I even kept the box because it's gorgeous and the tube is metal.  Many people don't like metal tubes because they tend to squeeze product out and into the cap and then you open it and it's all over when you open it.  You just need to be gentle with the tube!!  Also this will last quite awhile so the price is great. gin and rosewater,Neutral
I tried the Dead Sexy perfume in a boutique one day and the scent just lingered so much I *had* to buy it. As I've bought their hand creme before it's great to combine the two. This hand creme absorbs easily and does a good job of keeping your skin moisturized while the lotion does have a wonderful scent that doesn't overwhelm yet lingers a bit. Don't let the skulls fool you this is indeed sexy! wonderful lotion with a great scent,Neutral
Did you know that you can prevent all soap scum in your shower or tub by not using--wait for it--soap?  Use a body wash instead! I love the creamy feel of this particular body wash. It lathers very well and it doesn't have a perfume-y sent.  I've tried many other brands most quite a bit more expensive but this is my favorite.  No other brands gives me such a nice rich creamy lather.  It also works great as a bubble bath in the tub.  I love it when the best product also has the best price!I don't know why but this is hard to find in stores.  Target is about the only place I can find it but shipped to my door via subscribe and save is even better! My favorite wash at any price,Neutral
... of the Tokyo Milk 'Dark' perfumes. For some reason on me it smells like a freshly cut warm sweet flowers and grass. There's a soft 'herbal' scent that comes out after a few minutes that I'm assuming is the fennel but it's not a licorice scent at all. Nothing about this is candy-like. It's somehow fresh and green and a little musky with a touch of sweetness. It's a contradiction of scents and I think it's just perfect; innocence and sensuality combined. I could wear this any time of day and any time of the year. This is my favorite...,Neutral
This product is amazing!I have curly dry hair that is damaged from heat.  After I wash my hair I spray this through my hair focusing on my ends and it instantly brings my hair back to life! It makes my hair soft shiny and manageable not to mention it looks and feels healthy again! And it smells really really good its not too overpoweringly floral but kind of reminds me of a DKNY perfume. Overall great product! LOVE,great product
I was really excited to try this as I had read the amazing reviews and my hair stylist said it would be okay for hair that has been colored.Boy am I disappointed!!It left my fine curly hair flat and frizzy. No body limp curls frizz - disaster! There can't be much keratin in it to leave this much frizz. And I live in a dry climate so it's not like I'm dealing with humidity. The scent is also much stronger than I prefer (I want people to smell my perfume not my conditioner) and kind of cheap like something out of a drug store. Two stars because it did leave my hair feeling soft.P.S. My favorite conditioner by Bumble + Bumble has been discontinued which is why I'm trying new leave-ins. If anyone here knows of something comparable to Bumble + Bumble &#;Leave In Rinse Out&#; please let me know!!! Nope,Neutral
First off let me say that I LOVE the scent.  It's the only perfume that I used nearly everyday until the bottle was gone.  However it is NOT without its problems.  First it is impossible to get all the perfume out because of the design of the bottle.  The liquid falls toward the curved ends and it gets very annoying and frustrating.  Second after a few months when I pulled the cap off the ring on the top of the bottle would also come off.  Very cheap design!!  And then when i went to replace the cap it slightly pushed down on the top and let some of the perfume drip out.  Lastly this perfume has little to no staying power and you have to respray yourself after two hours if you want to smell nice all day.  I was really disappointed and then I saw the same perfume in a slightly different bottle at target and thought yes this is where it belongs.  Which is so sad because its a great scent and I would think a product with jennfier aniston's name on it would be marketed for a higher end retail. A few problems,Neutral
This is one of my favorite all time perfumes. The scent is amazing and though I can't smell it on myself I get many compliments. Favorite!!!,Neutral
I got this in France and will be purchasing this again online. The acid ingredients helps to unclog pores more effectively than using an acne needle and I do notice an improvement in my oily acne-prone skin's huge pores. It won't fix the problem completely of course. (my skin doctor told me that the pore/blackhead problem is almost unsolvable... ugh!) But it does help. I use this only at nighttime and use Chanel's Le Blanc moisturizer mixing with Philosophy's Vitamin C powder in the morning. While I always wake up with oily greasy face in the morning this product helps a lot in controlling the oily situation. It's not magic but the active ingredients really works. It's light and almost gel-like so it feels great on my oily skin (I personally hate all heavy creams). It's less irritating than Avene's Triacnel which I purchased in the same drugstore in the same time but gave up because it's too harsh on my skin.So overall..Pros:- light non-greasy;- not too harsh not drying;- nice smell not perfumed nor repelling;- affordable.Cons:- not super-magical-stuff. It helps but may not change your skin. The change may be too insignificant on skins with serious acne problems.- mine become watery when it went to / left... I can still use it but every time while shaking it I just secretly doubt if it's still okay.- sticky after application. So better used on clean skin as the last procedure of skin care. It meddles with my sunscreen so I have to use it only in evenings.LATER ADDED:I purchased this again on Amazon and to my surprise I didn't know that there are  versions of this product. The US version is consisted of % BP and it's not recommended to use over the whole face. I tried to find the made-in-France version but didn't see any online. So disappointed. I'm only looking for something that's mild and will gently make my acne-prone skin look better not something harsh & drying though fairly effective. The French version was simply a unclogging formula that can be used on a daily basis. Too bad that mine is running out. I guess this page is for the US version. It's fine but I'll only use it for emergencies. It works,Neutral
I was honestly surprised to like this conditioner...most natural conditioners either leave my hair frizzy & wild or greasy & gross.  This one did a good job at balancing everything...wasn't too heavy wasn't greasy didn't leave me a dried-out frizzy mess.  Could be better at detangling but it's certainly better than a lot of others.That said...I'm not wild about the way it smells.  Doesn't smell orangey or much like vanilla to me.  It would probably be a product that men as well as women could easily use - it's not a flowery perfumey smell and the scent doesn't linger.Note:  A little goes a long way.  I use much less of this conditioner than I do with others. good natural conditioner,Neutral
I got a sample of this and I immediately fell in love with the scent. I thought I would look for it online and found it way cheaper here than at the department stores. Reading through the reviews I was a bit iffy because some people were saying what they got was EDT and not EDP but luckily I was able to buy one that is sold by Amazon. My perfume came in an unopened/sealed box so I can't ask for anything better. I would say select your seller and read the description carefully. Going manhunting with my new scent!,Neutral
I think its different from what you get in stores. I did not like it at all. I used a whole bottle I baught at macy's. I have not used this perfume at all. I wish I could return it. Not genuine.,Neutral
I love the smell of this perfume.  I am in my mid-'s and prefer scents that are light and slightly fruity (not to musky) and this is perfect.  I find the scent to stay all day and be very refreshing.  Plus I love that the bottle is super cute and looks nice on my vanity with my other perfume bottles. Great Smell,Neutral
This perfume smells so Goooooooood!  I am so glad I decided to try this perfume.  I love the smell a nice soft modern floral scent.  The scent seems to last a couple of hours I would not say it last all day however.  I will most likely purchase this in the future when this bottle is gone. Beautiful Modern Floral Scent!  Love This Perfume!,Neutral
This is one of the best new perfumes I've encountered in years (and believe me I try them all). Jummy Choo's debut fragrance is very unique: floral but edgy with notes of patchouli and something else (maybe amber? whatever it is it's fab). I also must comment on the packaging as the bottle is gorgeous (and perhaps a rip-off of the Flowerbomb bottle? hmm...). Staying power of the fragrance is maybe slightly above average but the beautiful scent makes this a must-buy. I highly recommend it. Gorgeous fragrance,Neutral
I got a  oz sample from myperfumesamples.com (International shipping too! Woohoo!)I loved this out of all the Kardashian perfumes on the market. It is definitely a Unisex scent tending towards more of a man's scent. (But it's gorgeous!!) It is not overpowering and lasts for lengthy periods during the day. It's a good day AND night scent. Only drawback is sometimes one may have is a whiff of wet dog if you've gone out for a workout and drenched in sweat. (I cycle to work for about  hours a day up hillsetc so yes sweat with this perfume doesn't smell as good! As one would expect!)I am currently in search of finding a good shower foam/gel which enhances well in combination with this perfume.Other scents I love are Armani Mania (White)Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDP Idylle EDP by Guerlain (Summer Scent) Gucci's Gardenia and Jacob Classique (Canadian Scent - not Marc Jacobs) to name a few!Do try them especially if you like Unbreakable Bond..mmm. Get a sample first and then buy buy buy!,Neutral
Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas/Birthday; She wanted this a long time ago and could not find it anywhere! Perfume,long time
I'm a (not particularly feminine) male and the scent of this though flowery has been well appreciated by my girlfriend and friends on me my girlfriend also wears it with great satisfaction regardless of your gender the soft yet pleasant smell will work for you unless you're a man who likes the uber-musky overbearing scents that scream male. Great scent if you're not into extremely masculine stifling perfumes,Neutral
Have never smelled it but ordered because I actually like more masculine smelling perfumes such as eternity aqua and ck one...surprised that I actually like this! Not a Kardashian fan...but this perfume reminds me of my faves..a pretty nice value..it is a huge bottle..the first spray seems like dudes cologne but dries down a soft floral..like it! pretty good,Neutral
I love the scent of Method dish soaps but I've become sensitive to the flavor left on cookware.  No matter how much I scrub and rinse if there is the most infantessimal amount of oil left on a cooking pan the soap's perfume sticks around.  When you heat it up it enters your food and tastes bitter and revolting.So great for washing everything but cookware.  Clementine is less perfume-y than the lavender version but still too clingy for pots/pans. Not great on cookware (perfume flavor) but otherwise lovely.,Neutral
Perfect for the girly girl. This perfume is pretty and light sweet. It also has a hint of floral in it and it mixes well with the sweet almost pink candy smell. I love it! I also own paris hilton south beach they are wonderful! Adorable Light Sweet Scent and Pretty,Neutral
I love love this perfume. I feel in love with this perfume. This perfume is perfect for the spring/summer. It can be worn as an everyday perfume as well. My new love!!!,Neutral
I love all Paris' perfumes this isn't my FAVORITE but it still smells really good and for the price on Amazon it's def worth it. Not my fave but good,Neutral
This moisturizer brings back memories of using Hawaiian Tropic suntan oil in the late 's.  Heavily coconut scented this may interfere with any perfume you would want to wear as the scent lasts about  hours (on ME)-but it may not on YOU as we all have a different body chemistry.  Since this has such a beachy scent I limit my use of this to Spring and Summer.Even though it's called Argan Oil Moisturizer argan oil is # on the list of ingredients; the acai berry extract is way down on the ingredient deck.  I have dry skin and this leaves me feeling moisturized all day.  Good ingredients for the most part: several oils such as sesame jojoba and tea tree (the coconut overrides the tea tree odor which is a good thing).  High levels of Vitamin E.  This also contains parabens which some people want to avoid.  Made in the USA and no animal testing which ranks high in my book. Lovely tropical coconut scent that lingers,argan oil
I really like these wipes. I got a sample and have been buying them since. I love to use them all over. My face is refreshed but I also like to use on shoulders and arms during hot days. The witch hazel does have a strong smell but it does not last. It is wonderful to feel refreshed without out feeling perfumed after. I am very sensitive to created scents and like that this product leans more towards natural cleansing.I love that these soften my skin while removing oil. I love the soothing witch hazel. The # perk is that they are individually packaged so I add them to my purse or diaper bag when I am on the go.If you are looking for a more mature wipe that has natural scents and ingredients this is the product for you! Refreshing wipe calming effect of witch hazel,Neutral
I've been making my own bath salts for my husband for some time using sea salt and essential oils and the peppermint and eucalyptus blend has been his favorite for years. What I found interesting about this product is that it's not actually that much more expensive than making your own and the added vitamin E and aloe vera definitely gave him slightly softer skin then just plain sea salt and essential oils.I love how easily this dissolves how smooth and highly fragranced the water is and the fact that it uses real essential oils and not any artificial chemicals or perfumes. It's packaged in such a way that it looks like a real luxury product and it has a square base so it fits perfectly inside our medicine cabinet.And I'm excited about using sea salt in the bath because it contains additional minerals which can be absorbed through the skin. If you're interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath do a quick internet search for Mark's Daily Apple and how to take a better bath for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.Overall this is a great product and would make a wonderful gift for an athlete or any hard-working person in your life who might enjoy a muscle soak. A highly relaxing product,great product
The other night after a very tough week and a working Saturday I couldn't sleep and I was sore all over.  I put a cup of Muscle Soak Salts in a hot tub and soaked for twenty minutes or so. The salts completely dissolved. It was better than drugs! I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade away.  I also massaged my feet and a few achy muscles.The aroma is not perfumed but earthy and mellow (eucalyptus and peppermint); not pungent or overwhelming. After the bath I just lay on my bed and felt my skin and muscles actually pulsate. Needless to say I had a great night's sleep. I think this is going to be a regular ritual. There is also an aroma plug on the back so you can test the smell before using. I plan on using this on the evenings after I work out.  The package is very attractive and makes for a perfect gift type item. Product generously supplied by San Francisco Bath Salt Company. Perfect Relaxation Technique!,Neutral
So many bath salts either do not smell at all or have horrible perfume smell. This is one is just right. I get into my bath close my eyes and I fell like I am in the middle of the lavender meadow. Very relaxing. I  love how gentle it is on the skin too. Very good smell.,Neutral
I am seven months pregnant and avoided bathing during the first four months of pregnancy because of some potential risks to the baby. But once I was past that sensitive stage and started becoming larger the idea of taking the weight off with a relaxing bath started sounding more and more appealing. Obviously it is important to me to avoid any unnatural chemicals in the bath so the ingredients list of these bath salts was extremely appealing.Though I bathe regularly under ordinary circumstances using highly scented bath bombs from Lush I was shocked at how much of a difference this lavender sea salt product made in having a relaxing effect. I'm not sure whether it is the lavender essential oil or the minerals in the sea salt which is having such a great impact but the difference between sitting in a regular perfumed bath and relaxing in a tub of this product was marked - all of my muscles felt more relaxed I had less round ligament pain and I had a better night's sleep on the evenings I used this.The packaging is attractive and would make for a great gift it has a little opening to sniff the product on the back of the bag so you can smell it without opening it and it has a square bottom so it sits upright on the shelf. It dissolves quickly and easily and is a great luxury product. This would make a great gift for anyone undergoing a stressful time in their life. If you're interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath do a quick internet search for Mark's Daily Apple and how to take a better bath for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.

I don't remember the last time I had an Epson salt soak.  Last night after a very tough week and a working Saturday I couldn't sleep so I put a cup of lavender salts in a hot tub and soaked for twenty minutes.  The salts completely dissolved.

I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade away.The lavender is not perfumed but earthy and mellow; not pungent or overwhelming.  After the bath I just lay on my bed and felt my skin and muscles actually pulsate.  Needless to say I had a great night's sleep.  I think this is going to be a regular ritual.

I received one bag of San Francisco Salt Company's regular epsom salts free in exchange for writing an honest review.  I've also tried several of their other products and this one has the same high quality and great packaging.  I love using epsom salts in my bath because of the detoxifying qualities and because they help with sore muscles and skin conditions.  Their other products I've tried had lavender and eucalyptus in them which added a nice fragrance to the air while soaking.  These are the plain unscented version which is perfect for soaking sprains or for people who are sensitive to perfumes.I enjoyed these salts as much as their other products but the price seems a little high to me.  The product is pure and clean (no specks or other bits in them like some brands) and works great but unless I were giving it as a gift to someone I'd probably buy Dr. Teale's brand at Walmart ($ for three pounds). Excellent product perhaps a little overpriced,Neutral
I purchased this perfume without getting a chance to smell it first...I saw that she had a new fragrance out and I knew I had to have it!:) And although I love her first perfume and still wear it all the time I think I like this one a little better!...I love Beyonce' and I love her perfume line! ~I Love Beyonce Heat Rush~,Neutral
I love love love this scent. Next to Jessica Simpson's Fancy love this is my go to daytime perfume. And I'm not usually a celebrity perfume fan only because I'm not a fan of these celebrities' music/work lol. It's very fruity/sweet and it lasts a long time on me. The only thing that is annoying and worth mentioning is the shape of the bottle. It's really hard to hold with one hand and spray at the same time. The base is too wide to hold and the top is too short to hold as well. Maybe it's me and my hands are not big enough but I have to use both hands to use this perfume. Am I crazy? please tell me I'm not the only one with this problem... Anyways nice perfume affordable too Love this scent...,long time
LOVE LOVE LOVE this Beyonce Heat!!!! I have ordered a total of  bottles of it already & love it soooo much!!!! Even some family got on here & bought me some for Christmas! LOVE THEM ALL!! VERY quick delivery & packaged very safely! Will definitely be ordering more in future! =) FAVORITE PERFUME EVER!!!!,favorite perfume
Smelled this perfume at a local department store and loved it - purchased it and discovered that the smell doesn't last very long (not even on clothes) but can't expect much from perfume that costs less than $! Love the smell but doesn't last long :(,Neutral
This was a blind buy and I am happy with it. It is sweet smelling. I smell oranges and I smell some musk or incense or amber. There is something in this perfume that keeps it from being disgusting sweet and generic smelling. For me this perfume is perfect for Spring and Summer. You have to love fruity gourmand perfumes to be able to like this. I need a back up bottle of this! Summery Exotic Perfume,Neutral
For me Heat Rush is very mediocre. Nothing special at all. Smells like a cheap floral perfume with a splash of orange soda thrown on top but that's just my opinion. I was hoping for more citrus so this left me disappointed but it's definitely still wearable. VERY BLAH...,Neutral
I had the smaller bottle which recently ran out. I came on here looking for a better price and definitely found it. The bottle I received was HUGE lol. It will probably last for the next  years as I switch was perfumes I wear on a day-to-day basis. Love This Scent!,Neutral
Wonderful is rich and non drying which is great at  feet.  Smells clean doesn't overpower any perfume i wear love it will buy more,Neutral
I love this stuff so much!  It smells so good!!!  I get complements about the smell all the time no perfume necessary. Smells so good!!!,Neutral
This has a fairly subtle smell- pleasant but not too perfumey. It works well as a de-frizzer that doesn't make hair stiff and a little goes a long way because it's very slippery and easy to distribute. Minus one star just because I always prefer not to have to use my hands to apply hair product. Smells good not too crunchy,long way
I am a big fan of many of Neutrogena's products.  I regularly use their skin cleanserssoaps and suntan products.  I have sensitive skin and I don't like to use products with a lot of chemicals or fragrances. I trust the Neutrogena name and I associate it with safe hypoallergenic products.I count on Neutrogena to make products which aren't over-enhanced with perfumes dyes and other potentially allergy-causing substances. So I was quite disappointed when I opened the packet of foaming pads and got a strong whiff of perfume/chemicals. It's actually overwhelming at first.  And after trying it once I knew I couldn't use it again.  I'm not sure if it's the device itself or the foaming pads but my skin was red and irritated after only one use.For those of you who don't have sensitive skin and/or don't react to skin products with dyes and scents you may be fine with this product which is generally well-made.So the good points:Ergonomic design.  Well-constructed.  Looks like it will last.  Waterproof so you can use it in the shower.  Batteries are included. Does what it says it will do.Problems:Heavy scent. Not hypo-allergenic.  Pad just rotates-- some sort of vibration would probably make it clean better and provide more of a mini-facial feel. Can be rough on skin and cause redness.  Not for everyday use. Not for sensitive skin,sensitive skin
Pros: one bottle lasts forever affordable applies well light feeling no residue can be used on either dry or wet hair noticeably smooths hair and fights the frizzies.Cons: It really only has one...the smell. Some people love it but I find it is strong long lasting and it feels like I'm wearing cheap perfume. It is incredibly musky smelling which is a scent I usually tend to avoid. Honestly the smell reminds me of old lady perfume. But I enjoy how this makes my hair looks and feels so I'm hoping I'll eventually overlook that. I plan to keep using it. Effective,Neutral
I like this product because it does not weigh down my fine hair and it has a nice smell.  This does not have a perfume smell as some seem to have.  I rated it high because it also is long lasting and does not dull my hair. always a good choice,Neutral
The white soap is too thin and the clear one doesn't smell as good. The cucumber is our favorite by far. It's got a a great fresh scent not in the least bit flowery or overbearing. It doesn't smell up the whole bathroom or follow you around like a perfume. They're a little expensive but worth it to us for the cleanliness and convenience the hands free dispenser offers. Favorite scent and thickness,Neutral
excelente perfume muy suave y fresco se puede usar a diario recibi el producto en el tiempo estimado lo recomiendo! Excelente,Neutral
I have  of these for the past  years. They didnt leak.  is in my car in a makeup bag in the back seat (I just leave it there with brushes hairspray mascara etc) for if I have a meeting after work.Anyway I've had other portable perfume containers over the years too that were nice. But I like this one as I dont have to pull the spray head off of the perfume/ cologne bottle so getting the liquid into this is faster & more convenient.Some perfume spray heads have the sprayer actually crimped onto the perfume bottle's glass so its a real pain to get it off & then you cant put the sprayer back on the perfume bottle so its now open forever. Works for me,Neutral
very easy to fill you just spray into the bottom part of the atomizer then screw it tight done. you can see how much perfume you have spreyed in by turning the atomizer horizontally to the ground while it is closed and from where there is a see-through part you can tell how much room you have to keep spaying.  didn't explain that very well but the point is you can tell how much perfume you have left and if you need to refill. color is a very nice black. easy to fil and very pretty,Neutral
This is a great mud mask.  It makes my skin very smooth.  The couple of things that i don't like is that  It does have a strong perfume smell to it and pieces of black leaves in it which I don't care for. I use this product before applying my make up.  It smooths lines and makes make up look flawless.  I would buy this product again. LOVE THIS PRODUCT,Neutral
Remember that annoying girl in school who thought she was a '' but really was a '' at best? And no one had the guts to say it to her face because she was so oblivious and self-absorbed? Well similarly this is a mediocre clay-based mask that is a victim of its own overhyped hollywood glam marketing.The product is overpriced for what it is. Glamglow has an aggressive marketing team who hustles like crazy which is why its so (over-)hyped up. They somehow got this product into all W hotels so you are inclined to purchase it in your hotel room. $ for a sample-sized jar. Ridiculous. I saw it in the hotel bathroom when I was on vacation and couldn't believe it.Upon opening first thing you notice is the strong scent of artificial green tea. The package promotes green tea in the formula and yeah there are bits of leaves in the jar but then why load it up with a highly fake non-green-tea-smelling artificial fragrance unless you have something to hide? I grew up drinking green tea. It should NOT smell like sickly sweet Elizabeth Arden Green Tea perfume (which this mask does). Further inspecting the ingredient listing fragrance is listed which is artificial and not necessary.Glamglow totally irritates sensitive skin or delicate skin b/c its loaded with pumice bits and scrubbers (yes PUMICE = the stuff you use to scrub your foot calluses which Glamglow lovingly calls volcanic rock) that act as an exfoliator once the mask is dry. Upon rinsing the pumice was so scratchy and i could feel it creating microtears in my acne-prone skin. The mask dries quickly but the clay is embedded with pumice so it's impossible to wash off without literally *scouring* your face. (shudder)Next it is loaded with a methyl salicylate or menthol type of tingle. The sensation if you have sensitive red irritated or acne-prone skin can be very painful and stinging. i find that masks which add the tingle do so in order to warrant a feeling of action that their product works. If the product really worked to purify and synthesize collagen (seriously --that's what they claim) then you wouldn't need to add gimmicks to fool people.Not only that but Glamglow has been spamming the boards on MakeupAlley and other beauty forums. I wrote a post on a *cosmetic procedures* board about enlarged pores and rec's for derm treatments--guess what? got spammed with try Glamglow!! post written by an obvious shill.  It was such a promo publicity-laden post that the message was removed by the forum police after multiple complaints. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth and says a LOT about the company. They are trying so hard to promote this hollywood celeb secret and doing it in such a crass way it's one step away from late-night infomercial disaster taking away all credibility in this company's skincare science if any.If you have sensitive delicate dry irritated acne-prone or reddened skin I do not recommend. It's too harsh and scratchy.If you have tough-as-nails oily skin you can use this but why fall for the hype when there are so many other mud masks out there at a better price with better ingredients? Absolute crap & hype. Contains PUMICE --yes the stuff you use to file your foot calluses,sensitive skin
I am  and have crows feet and small lines under my eyes.  I use Baby face on my eyes after using the babyface nightcream.  While I have never used Babyface in the past I believe this may be my lifelong beauty regime.  I have tried every eye cream out there and have spent a fortune.  Babyface makes my skin dewy without being greasy.  My fine lines are extremely dimished and I have only been using it for two weeks.  This is the best eye cream out there today in my opinion.  My face absorbs it quickly which is the sign of a good eyecream.  It has no perfume which is great for my sensitive skin I just cannot say enough about this cream.  Though I should or everyone will find out the secret and it will be sold out everywhere.  I even use it around my mouth where I don't have fine lines but have developed a slight droop off the corners of my mouth.  Not anyomore they are gone in less than two weeks.  Love Love Love it. Best eyecream I have ever used,sensitive skin
This is pretty inexpensive compared to most eye creams but for what you actually get in this tube it still costs too much. It's little more than a creamy petrolatum product. It's my own fault for waiting until AFTER I bought and used it to read the ingredients. I could have bought a jar of Vaseline for half the price and x more product... AND it would be fragrance-free. That's my biggest complaint: this is like a strong floral perfume which is completely useless in an eye cream and it stings my eyes. If I have to be careful to avoid getting my eye cream in my eyes because it might sting then I want a different eye cream. As a standard moisturizer it works as well as Vaseline would but for a more effective product if you don't mind fragrance in your eye cream buy Palmer's Cocoa Butter Vitamin E Concentrated Cream in the .-ounce tube. It works as well or better for a fraction of the price. The strong fragrance really stings my eyes,Neutral
My family has now gone through two sets of this shampoo and conditioner.  I purchased the set for $.  If it was still $ I would consider buying it again for my other family members who still like it.  For me it's a little too perfumed.  I smell the scent of coconut all day long and that's not really what I want to be smelling.  I rarely wear perfume but when I do I want that to be the only scent I smell not coconut from my hair.I also noticed that the two sellers selling this have changed the MSRP repeatedly raising it upward with the number of reviews.  At $ per bottle it was okay.  At $ per bottle I can find something much better at my grocery store in the health food aisle and it will be organic and perfume-free.For the $ they're asking I could buy -  ounce bottles of GloNaturals % organic argan oil (vitacost) and add that to my conditioner and shampoo when I want to with plenty left for other uses. Okay heavily perfumed,argan oil
The first night I applied this I noticed a big difference.  I thought maybe I was just thinking I saw a reduction in wrinkles but my forehead was noticeably smooth.  So I continued to apply it.  I began to notice a significant reduction in fine lines.  The deeper lines were reduced but you can still see them.I started using this on my neck and I noticed that it firmed up.  Not dramatically but noticeably.  It really reduced the wrinkles.I then looked at my upper chest.  I am a woman and I have some lines there that lead down towards my mid chest.  So I started putting this on that area.  It took a couple weeks but I noticed a major reduction in the crease lines that are on my chest.  This I thought was awesome!Make sure you don't put it on heavily.  If you do it will leave a sticky feeling.  You need to put it on lightly.  I use a little more at night because I'm going to bed and won't notice the sticky feeling.  When I wear it during the day I apply it first then my moisturizer then my makeup.  This doesn't interfere with any of my other products.  It also doesn't have a heavy smell.  It has a light perfume smell that dissipates within about  minutes after you apply it.I love this stuff!  I hope it lives up to its claims of reducing wrinkles from forming.  I'm going to keep using it.  You get a lot in a bottle and it lasts awhile.  I bought this over a month ago and it still feels like I have quite a bit left.  I haven't had any problems with the bottle so perhaps they have fixed the issue that others have had with it failing.  Give this a try if you are looking for something that works! This stuff actually works!,Neutral
Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex didn't disappoint me and delighted me with the results.This product was gentle to my skin so there was so brush burn feeling or redness. It softened wrinkles and either caused them to vanish or not be quite so obvious. The scent was light and soft so it didn't overpower the scent of other HBA products or tussle with my perfume or other fragrances.I didn't see any immediate difference but after a few uses I began to notice a change in the appearance of both fine and deeper wrinkles. It only seems to improve my appearance with continued use. A definite improvement over other products I've used. Another Primo Product From Olay,Neutral
It works some and the texture is easier to apply than Nadinola's fade cream. The smell is toooooo perfume-y which is why my rating for this product is  star minus...Other all I like Ambi better and I was hoping this would have a cocoa butter smell because I love the cocoa butter smell now it's just too much perfume oh well. It's okay but not that great,Neutral
Hydroxatone is best known for infomercials and home shopping presentations and is at the upper end cost wise.While nothing lasts forever I do note that this particular formula has good enough almost instant results but nothing long-term if you forget to apply it (fair enough it is a COSMETIC)Great for guys as there is NO perfume that I can detect and is VERY easy to apply even under the eye area. I found the most dramatic results with forehead lines and the 's - really outstanding as a quick fix.Some have complained about the jar but it is typical package for high-end luxe  cosmetics.  A VERY little bit goes a LONG way and as with ANY good wrinkle reduction product you do NOT need to slather it on-- if you do you will not care for the result!This product would be terrific for a pre-photo-shoot or business meeting when you need that extra edge. I like it better than I thought I would.  My core concern is the price it would be nice to see a larger size or price adjustment of some sort. Might be hard to afford as the months go on.That being said it does work well and one only needs little bit to get noticeable results. Works if you use it...,little bit
Let me start by saying I almost spent a ton of money to buy a perfume roller just to get a purse sized tube of my favorite perfume and its not cheap!  Someone suggested an atomizer and I looked to Amazon for one as usual I found what I needed. This cute little baby does exactly what I wanted. Its not only cute and stylish but it holds the perfect amount of scent. I had doubts about how it would work with a spray bottle but no worries its simple to use and fill. If you are looking for something cute to hold your favorite perfume and not take the whole bottle with you get this!!! And the shipping? Crazy fast. I'm very happy with this product. AMAZING,favorite perfume
I like this little atomizer. It's really nice when you have samples of fragrances that come in small vial bottles. This way you can spray it on instead of dab it on. Much more effective! Flo Refillable Perfume Atomizer,Neutral
small enough to fit into the closed palm of your hands. perfect for traveling and updating your perfume during the day. love the color. it's perfect for me. not sure how often it requires refill or how it will handle a change in perfume... so will the second perfume smell like the first one? not sure yet. tried to put some water into it to try it before putting any expensive perfume but i didn't manage to put any water which i would think would help me &#;clean&#; it between perfumes. but that's detail. overall i am very very happy with this. hopefully it lasts! very easy to fill very pretty and small,Neutral
This is a way better idea than other atomizers I've seen where you have to use a funnel and risk spilling expensive perfume.  The design isn't flawless though.  The seal where you fill the atomizer is not perfect and I lost a little bit of perfume during filling (but just a very minor amount).  Otherwise works perfect! Good idea!,little bit
I bought Taylor Swift's perfume a couple of months ago and one day it began spraying pure liquid instead of atomizing it into a perfume and the make of the bottle made it impossible to remove the top. I did some searching and I found this little guy. I put the nozzle directly into the rubber bottom and began spraying the liquid into the atomizer. It's honestly like magic my perfume smells exactly the same even after being transferred to the FLO. If your perfume breaks don't throw it out just use this and you'll be all set.Update: I'm not sure if this is the perfume itself or the atomizer but when it reached the bottom of the perfume it smelled a little too much like alcohol. I refilled it straight from the perfume bottle and it returned to its normal smell. Just something to keep in mind. This saved my $ perfume,Neutral
I received this in a very shady looking packet. The moment I saw the packet I doubted if it was a genuine Flo product. The logo packet insert and the actual atomizer all looked like the real deal though.Filling it was not easy and spills occurred. However the biggest issue was the spray nozzle. It wouldn't spray consistently and either stream perfume or not spray at all. I got the Travalo instead and returned this. Spills and spray nozzle won't spray,Neutral
This is great for travel.  It holds a good amount and is easy to fill.  However when I went back to fill it the second time. I couldn't remember how.  I ended up getting perfume all over my hands.  I'd recommend keeping the instructions until you've filled it a few times and get the hang of it.  The initial filling using the instructions was a breeze.  Great for cologne too and it now comes in black which is very sleek looking. I've bought several more as gifts. Works but keep the instructions,Neutral
It good for travel...but not what I intended for...I needed a bottle to put my expensive bottle of perfume in because the pump was broken...but it wasn't large enough to hold the remainder of my perfume from the original bottle. Wasn't what I was expecting,Neutral
I am very happy with this face cream!  It is not heavy like &#;cream&#; would suggest but not as liquid-like as a lotion.  I was having trouble with dry skin this winter.  Heavier creams were making me break out and fragrances seemed to irritate the flaking.This lotion helped my dry skin without either of these problems.  The products with sunscreen seem to irritate my skin as well so I don't mind the lack of sunscreen as I use this at night too.  The flaky itchy patches on my forehead and nose are gone my skin feels great.The bottle pump operates smoothly and does not get a dried clog at the opening every day like some others I've used.This truly has no fragrance it just smells like lotion the way fragrance-free detergent smells like soap - no perfume odor at all.Thank you Burt's Bees I hope to use this product for a long time to come! Just what my skin needed,long time
Too many times I've purchased face products for Sensitive Skin only to get perfumed filled greasy creams I can't use.  This one is neither.  Although it's called NIGHT cream I use it during the day.  It's almost impossible to find day cream without sunscreen in it so NIGHT cream is about the only thing I can find.  Even with my past Melanoma I don't want sunscreen in my face cream.  Too many chemicals on the skin are NOT good.  That's why I want my face cream to be my face cream and my sunscreen to be my sunscreen.  That way I'm the one who decides when to put sunscreen on my skin and when not to. Not Greasy and Smells Nice,sensitive skin
love this cream! absorbs quickly in the skin doesn't leave you feeling all slimy or greasy penetrates nicely leaving skin very smooth and soft healing dry skin not a strong perfume-y smell just pleasant ease who knew?,dry skin
I am one of those crazy-allergic-to-every-scent women.  Perfumes dyes sulfates unnatural-made-in-the-lab body washes make me itch and break out in hives.  And tempt me to OD on benedryl!  Not this body wash.  What a joy to find a body wash that smells great and no hives.  Great stuff.  Order it you will not be sorry.I have tried the roll on perfume and the lotion as testers in the store.  Sorry but those are a no-go for me.  Only the wash works with my type of skin and nose.Order it and enjoy. Pacifica Tuscan Blood Orange - great body wash,Neutral
Arrived on time. Got this great smelling perfume for a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend this product and will be  purchasing again. Grrreeaaatt!!!!,Neutral
SMELL GOOD WEAR AFTER I GET OUT TUBE DONT NEED PERFUME WHEN WEAR IT MILD SMELL GOOD DEAL WILL BUY MORE PRETTY BOTTLE,Neutral
This shampoo bottle is big - . ounces and about  inches tall - so make sure your shower caddy can handle a large bottle like this.This SLS-free formula contains gentle cleansers and is designed to be safe for colored hair. It is also paraben free. However I always get a little annoyed with products like this which make it sound like it's a natural organic product. Yes it does contain organic extracts such as cucumber extract grape seed extract avocado fruit extract and aloe leaf extract. But look closely at the ingredients and there are a lot of chemicals with long names that show that it's a lot like so many other shampoos out thereThe shampoo itself is a peachy color and quite thick in consistency.  I pumped a little bit out onto the back of my hand and it just sits there. The shampoo has a sweet powdery scent which is pleasant and I actually like it quite a bit.  However if you're sensitive to strong perfumey scents and prefer more natural scents then don't use this.I like pump bottles of shampoo for ease of use in the shower but in this case the pump bottle was not the best choice. It's very difficult to pump out due its thick consistency. Even my husband complained about it.I use one full pump of the shampoo each time I wash my slightly above-the-shoulder length hair. Once I work it into my hair the shampoo does develop a thick lather but it takes a bit of work and obviously quite a bit of shampoo to get it this point. Consequently it seems to take quite a while to rinse out.On the positive side my hair does feel moisturized and healthy. I skip using a conditioner as it's not necessary with this shampoo. My hair is slightly wavy with a tendency to frizz but when I use Kirkland Moisture Shampoo it makes the straightening process easier and I have significantly less frizz. Best of all it doesn't weigh down my hair and I am able to shampoo my hair every other day. I think my hair color also does quite well with this shampoo and seems to not fade as quickly.  stars Reasonable alternative to salon shampoo,little bit
I bought this after reading the review below and I'm so glad that I did. This smells exactly like Bath & Body Works Cozy Autumn Vanilla but it's cheaper and the consistency of this body butter is so much more luxurious than BBW. This is a very soft vanilla and cinnamon scent and applying it is so relaxing for me. The consistency of this body butter is PERFECT- smooth rich and creamy (not souffle-like like a lot of body butters I've tried in the past). This moisturizes extremely well and makes my skin as soft as a baby's behind. It is a bit greasy at first but it dries in about  minutes leaving my skin soft but not slippery. I like wearing this under my vanilla-based perfumes. I'll definitely be using this all fall and winter since my skin tends to get really dry. The only thing I don't like about this is that it's in a tub so I feel like I need to sterilize my hands before I can dip them in the jar. I didn't take a lippie away though since all body butters are packaged the same way. Perfect body butter for Fall/Winter!,Neutral
My hands down favorite favorite lotion. This lotion is non greasy but absorbs really well into dry thirsty skin without feeling thick or sticky. The scent is very natural and light so there isn't any irritating perfumes or bothersome smell to it. And the best part is the lotion lasts all day so you won't see scaly skin a few hours later. The best time to apply is after a shower and you're good to go but it's great anytime. I use it all year round!!! And the price is CHEAP on amazon compared to regular stores. Best lotion everrrrrrr!,Neutral
I am a African American female and I have been using natural hair products for five years now and my hair has grown to mid back length but unfortunately I could not find a natural hair product that could lay my very curley wavy hair down while putting my hair in protective styles like buns and ponytails.There would be times that I would spend an hour in the mirrior laying my curls down to have a smooth look for my ponytails or bunsI even tried tieing my hair down at night with heavy oils and natural creams but nothing laid my curls down they would just pop up from out of my bun which made it seem as though I didn't even bother to do any type of grooming to my hair. I just gave up on natural hair gels and holding creams and decided to purchase this product after watching reviews on Youtube and going to different hair sites. I am glad that I purchased this gel it has some good ingredients I like that it has glycerin and that the first ingredient is water. I put my hair in a bun and my edges are so laid and smooth there are no curls popping up all over my head and my wave pattern is nice and shiny..I did have to add just a subtle amount of my coconut oil to my hair because the gel was just a little hardning but after applying a dime size amount of my coconut oil my hair was laid and smooth with this gel...The gel has really nice hold and the smell has a very light perfume scent that I love it just has like a fresh light scent..I gave this product  stars out of five only because I have to add a little oil to make it more smooth and because it's not % natural but either than that I will keep this gel as my go to gel from now on. So far so good,Neutral
I just purchased  Waajid Curl Cream this week I will admit that I was amazed at how it really does define waves and curls with out even using that much! I am only giving it  stars because I would have liked a little  more shine and I am little concerned about one ingredient (DMDM Hydantoin)This product is not greasy sticky smelly nor does it leave a hard crunch  a little goes a looong way! I was hoping to get these same results from Shea Moisture Curling Enhancing Smoothie but I was very disappointed because Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie goes on as a heavy  white paste that takes forever to dry & absorb into the hair.Waajid is far superior to some of my old stand by products like Sportn' Waves & Wave Builders both products are full of Petroleum & Lanolin... also Wave Builders has a  STRONG perfume fragrance............ I think this product may be become my new number ONE! A little more shine would help,Neutral
This product I originally bought for my baby thinking - they'll leave the dimethicone out in the children's version - not so....So while I cannot use for him and his cute curls I am now using it for myself. It is so much cheaper than the adult version in the bottle with the only real difference being no perfumes in the ingredients list that I simply save myself the cash and buy for my hair versus the larger adult version which doesn't even come in the handy squirt nozzle bottle. Use for me not my baby - Dimethicone,Neutral
As anyone who really knows me will attest I'm pretty much a drag queen trapped in a business woman's body; In private I'm all about the silver and platinum make-up and nail polish and shoes. BLING IT ON BABIES!!!!!!There was a special banner selling this silver eye-shadow so I clicked and it bought it for me.Nifty simple Yay! Silver eyelid bling! I wore it once nice and silvery all was good in the universe.Second time I went to apply the shadow POW! the applicator sponge part fell into the shadow irretrievably broken leaving me to use the hard plastic nub part to scoop out shadow and then slather it on with a finger as if I were Mimi from the Drew Carey show.Not cool Covergirl eye-shadow not cool.Sure it wasn't terribly expensive but still  dollars for one use makes it more expensive per oz. than most high-end perfumes.So feh on your shoddy sponge wand Covergirl.I'll go back to not using your products in general. Foam applicator fell off into Eye Shadow after  uses,Neutral
It deemed biggger to me on picture display but its still nice. can hold my little perfumes and deodorant. it's nice. Nice purchase. Good wish it was bigger,Neutral
I along with everyone else I imagine hear all kinds of stuff about miracle products. Those that do everything it seems except your laundry and your dishes. Then a new one comes along and the other one is mostly forgotten about. However argan oil has been news for long enough that I was finally beginning to get curious about its supposed benefits. So when I was offered some to try I accepted.I have extremely dry sensitive skin. There are very very few products that I can use on my face that won't end up causing some sort of reaction. The rest of my body while not as sensitive is still very dry. I tried the Pura D'or Argan Oil on my body first and loved how easily it absorbed without feeling greasy. It has a very light almost nonexistent smell - nice because I'm not too fond of products that smell like they were created in a cheap perfume factory.As for my face - I hesitantly applied a small bit to one section of my face and waited for the redness and burning to commence. When after  minutes there were no signs of either I applied it the rest of my face before I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning my face felt soft and supple and there were no signs of any dry skin patches. I have used this product on my face since then and am so pleased! I love not having to use the overly processed facial creams in order to keep my skin from freaking out on me!I have not tried most of the myriad other ways that argan oil can be used but the fact that my skin is doing so well with it is all I really need. I heartily recommend this to anyone who has skin issues similar to mine - I think you will be just as pleased as I have been.NOTE: I was offered a bottle of this product to test by the company in exchange for a review. However I accepted with the caveat that I take great pride in writing honest reviews regardless of where the product comes from. Excellent for my dry extremely sensitive skin!,argan oil
As a newcomer to argan oil I was surprised by how versatile it is.  You can apply it to any part of your body from hair to heels.  My skin absorbs it quickly no matter where I put it and because of this it doesn't leave an oily sheen just a silky softness.  The only application that I did not like was in my hair -- more on that later.I have extremely delicate and sensitive skin on my face and I had no negative reactions to the oil even when I applied it under my eyes.  (I did this only after trying it on the rest of my face for a few days.)  My hands are staying hydrated between applications even after I wash my hands a lot during the day and use alcohol-based germ killer.  Often in the winter I have to use a thick cream on my hands at night and by the next night my hands are crying out for more.  If I skip a day of argan my hands don't seem to mind.  The oil is supposed to be good for nail strengthening and cuticle softening.  While it softened my cuticles I can't say what effect if any it is having on my nails since they are generally strong.I researched argan oil online so that I would know one should look for when purchasing it.  This brand fits all the criteria:  glass bottle dark container cold-pressed oil % argan.  I also discovered from the research that argan oil is perishable (hence the need for a dark bottle) so if you don't use it up within six months or so you should buy a new bottle. The Pura D'Or Argan Oil uses a pump to dispense the oil and that can be a little messy.  I also wonder how well it will work when the oil gets near the bottom.  The drips down the side of the bottle from using the pump got a half-star deduction from me.I also did a comparison between argan oil and the much cheaper castor oil which is often used for the same purposes.  Castor oil was much stickier and more difficult to spread.  It also was not absorbed as quickly which meant that the oily sheen lasted longer.  The argan oil simply feels more silky and I felt confident that I was spreading a thin layer everywhere.Now about using it on hair . . . . it was not a good thing for me.  I used a small amount about as much as I would on my face and massaged it into my wet hair before styling.  Ick.  Even after combing it through I could see it and feel it in my dried hair.  The argan oil did not get absorbed as quickly as it did on my skin.  Because I'm blonde the argan oil darkened the areas where it stuck.  This might be great to use on dark and/or damaged hair but it had only negative effects on mine.  I won't waste this expensive oil on my head again.  This didn't make me love the argan oil any less but it did teach me where it worked best on my body.Argan oil has been a revelation for me.  I like that a natural organic oil can actually work better than many preserved perfumed chemically-created products. Note:  The manufacturer supplied a sample for review.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann Oh m'gosh!  I love this stuff -- except in my hair (- stars),argan oil
I received this product in the mail today...and I must say that I can NOT believe I have never heard of it!  This is the number one staple for everything...I'm SHOCKED!!!  It works as a moisturizer primer before makeup acne medication for dry patches on skin dry hair...everything!  I opened it and used it right away as I was very excited about receiving it.  I first used it as a facial moisturizer (I have combination skin-dry/oily) and I was shocked that it didn't feel like that greasy oily residue that most oils leave behind.  Next I reviewed the ingredients and since it was all natural I decided to use it on my son's diaper rash.  Since it did not sting at all on my uber-sensitive face and was all natural I thought it could work.  It was amazing!  I never thought I would find a product with so many uses!So I decided to try something a little bit out of the box just to see what would happen. When I was serving in Iraq there were a ton of vendors that sold perfume oils.  Anything you could think of Calvin Klein Gucci Ralph Lauren etc.  I remember that the oils that I purchased there would last FOREVER and the smells were just amazing but they left a lot of greasy residue when you wore them.  So I decided to try that with my Pura D'or oil.  I was a bit unsure as to how this would turn out as the oil had a bit of a tea tree oil scent to it but much to my surprise the oil and perfume fragrance combined left a wonderful scent behind-that wasn't greasy like the ones I had purchased overseas.  It moisturized my skin without feeling like it was too much and scent is still going  hours later but not so much that it could be overbearing.  The perfume I used to combine it was Curve.Next I figured that since this product had worked for so many other purposes I would try it with something else too.  I work in Law Enforcement (Deputy) and am on my feet constantly.  I am always walking around checking on inmates and occasionally getting into altercations.  It's all part of the job but it takes a horrible toll on my poor feet.  I am constantly having to buy foot creams powders and even have resorted to purchasing petroleum jelly to put on my feet when I go to bed.  If I don't do something to moisturize my feet at night I will wake up with them hurting literally.  It's actually painful.  So I had been doing my usual routine of putting petroleum jelly on my feet and then putting on a pair of moisturizing socks right before bedtime.  I decided to see if this Argan oil would work on them too.  Yep-not only was I able to go to sleep feeling like I had baby soft feet but everything felt amazing.Honestly I am always trying to save space in my apartment and if I can find a product that does double or even triple duty I will buy it just to save space.  Just having this alone has saved me so much room it's not even funny.  Now I can get rid of so many unnecessary products that are taking up room and have one that can pretty much do everything.One last thing...tanning.  I have tried to stop using tanning beds because of the dangers involved and have went to sunless tanners to get that summer glow year round.  There are a few rules to sunless tanning: exfoliation moisturize & MOISTURIZE!!!  Most tanning lotions will last a LOT longer if you moisturize and as an added benefit they stay even a lot longer.  If you use this right after applying a tanning lotion it will last -X longer.  Somehow it seems to keep the skin conditioned and the tan looking perfect.I'm sort of a beauty product junkie and have tried many fad products in the past.  I always thought that the miracle product was a myth until I found this.  Seriously if you even try it one time it will change your mine-I know it certainly did mine : )Packaging:  The product comes in a very secure box to ensure that nothing is broken/leaked.  The bottle itself comes in a really cute little pouch and there is a pamphlet that also has information on it concerning the product and its uses.  The paper that the information is printed on is organic...and that made me appreciate the company even more.  They are environmentally conscious and were willing to pay a bit extra to get the type of paper that was better for the environment.  I don't believe that there is a better way to do business.  Not only do they sell an AMAZING product but they also care about the environment.  The bottle comes in a really cute little drawstring bag and the amount of oil dispensed with each push is not too little nor too much.  I have no complaints whatsoever in the packaging/appearance/function of this product.The only complaint (con) that I have for this oil is that I did not order a lifetime supply :)  I really do wish I had known about this sooner there is no telling how much I have spent on products in the past that did not have a quarter of the result that this Argan oil has.

Let me first say that Pura D'or is the BEST! Their products as well as their customer service are outstanding.I've been using Pura D'or products for a while now and decided to give their Pure Organic Argan Oil a try. I've been using it on my skin and hair for about  months now and it really is incredible. I'll be  in a couple months and have slight sun damage on my face (darker spots) fine wrinkles and rosacea and am beyond pleased with this product.For face: After I wash my face while the skin is still damp I rub on a few drops of oil and let it sink in. It really is miraculous. Dark spots on my forehead and cheeks from sun damage are fading as are the dark circles under my eyes. Fine lines are diminishing as well. My skin glows in a beautifully healthy way and I've received quite a few compliments in the past few days about how great I look. I do love what this does! I've found it works best on damp skin--it not only locks moisture in it also makes the oil easier to use. I don't need to use as much it spreads more easily and sinks in better. Oh yes! I had a small pimple outbreak on my chin and this stuff cleared it up in a day. There must be some kind of antiseptic quality similar to Walnut oil that helps heal outbreaks rashes and cuts. This makes my skin velvety soft much softer than when I use moisturizer by itself. When I first started using it my skin drank it up like no one's business. I don't need to use as much anymore.Body: the red spots on my arms are gone. The skin is soft and smooth. The texture on my neck and chest looks much better too. I use this after shaving my legs and alligator skin doesn't happen anymore! Again just a couple drops on damp skin works. Don't need a lot! The condition of my nails has also improved--after I use it on my face or body I always rub the excess into my nails and cuticles. My cuticles are also healthier - easier to push back and no hang nails.Hair: I have high lighted hair and the ends can become very dry. I rub a couple drops in the palm of my hands and then apply it to the ends. After that I cimb my hands through my hair but avoid the scalp because I need lift and I tend to have oily scalp yet dry ends. I have heard that it is great if you have dandruff or dry scalp though. It really helps cut down on fly-aways without adding any weight.All in all it's big YES for my skin. I forgot to mention I have sensitive skin and it reacts to most products i.e. rash and pimples. I have had none of that with Pura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil.People Have commented on the smell-I think it smells good. It definitely doesn't smell sweet or perfumey-and it shouldn't! It's % Argan Oil and that's it. In other words it doesn't smell like synthetic cosmetic products do. It smells a little like sesame oil and I don't even smell it unless I put my nose to the bottle. I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it though. It doesn't just sit on the surface-it penetrates deeply and nourishes skin hair and nails.This has become as essential as toothpaste and lipstick for me!It really does help not just the look but the overall health of my skin and nails. Highly recommend Pura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil! Pura D'or is the BEST!,argan oil
I will be the first to admit I usually do not spend a lot of money on personal skin care and hair products. If I do need to purchase something special such as a facial moisturizer or deep conditioner for my hair I generally peruse my coupon stash and then try and find something competitively priced that I have a coupon for. In the absence of a coupon I will find a comparable store brand product and take my purchase home to use.Thus being given the opportunity to try Pura d'Or Argan Oil is a bit of a luxury for me. I am the girl who wears no makeup; the depth of my skincare routine is applying Oil of Olay to my face and Eucerin to my dry cracked skin only when I feel it is needed. Using a beauty product (especially one that is an oil treatment) that costs more than $ is high class and after using this product for nearly  full weeks I can say with % honesty that you do get what you pay for.PackagingPura d'Or Argan Oil (shipped to you within a bubble envelope inside of a sturdy box) is packaged within a glass bottle with a plastic dispenser tip and a cover to placed over the top when finished. In this instance I tried the  fl. oz. ( mL) bottle. Due to the aforementioned careful packaging there was no damage to the bottle. Oh and I forgot to mention that the bottle arrives inside of a small linen drawstring bag. Personally having to pull the bottle out of a bag each time that I wish to use the product was a bit annoying so I repurposed the bag for some other knick-knacks.The bottle itself is brown glass and feels durable. The shiny gold label on the bottle clearly indicates the product name uses and prominently indicates that the product is USDA organic and cruelty free. The plastic dispenser will give you exactly a pea-sized droplet of the argan oil when you depress it. Since the directions for use on the side of the package indicates that you simply need a pea-sized amount the dispenser is ingenious and also minimizes the possibility of you using too much. I found this aspect to be very nice.UsesPura d'Or Argan Oil reminds me somewhat of WD-. No I do not recommend using it to grease the hinges on your doors; what I mean is there are a lot of uses for this product other than the obvious as a skin moisturizer. The label indicates that it can be used as a daily moisturizer morning & nighttime treatment and to heal protect & condition everything from head to toe. I should note that I did not use it to cover my entire body rather I used it for a few specific issues that I believe a lot of people experience. These issues are below:Split Ends: I have rather long thick hair. The extent of my haircare is to brush it back while it is still wet and put it into a ponytail or a loose braid. I sometimes use a deep conditioner but by and large I generally just shampoo my hair. I rarely use blow dryer or put a lot of products in my hair. Hair spray is something that I only use if I am going out. This means that I do not have a lot of damage to my hair however; I do get a fairly good amount of split ends. Using the oil I massaged three pea-sized droplets into the end of my hair each night before I went to bed. After about a week of nightly use my split ends seem to be much healthier and I did not notice any further damage to the ends of my hair. This is a definite thumbs-up for this product.Severely Dry Skin: due to the winter time my skin dries out fairly often. The dry heat from the furnace will result in patches that are almost scaly and can be downright painful. Before I received this oil to try I used Eucerin Intense Repair Ointment; while the ointment helped it seemed like I had to apply it several times a day -and the dry skin always came back. For the argan oil I used it on a particularly rough spot on my elbow; this is one of the many spots I tried to heal with the Eucerin beforehand. I rubbed in a pea-sized amount of the oil two times a day; within three days my elbow was completely healed. In fact I have not had a recurrence of that particular dry skin patch since it healed.Nail and Cuticle: again due to the dry heat associated with winter (forced air heating through a furnace) the skin around my fingernails and the cuticles themselves sometimes crack and even bleed. I used Pura d'Or Argan Oil on all  fingers again with applications twice daily. While it didn't heal any wounds I did notice that my fingernails were healthier and the skin around them had fewer cracks. In addition I was able to push my cuticles back easier. Pura d'Or Argan Oil did not exacerbate any cuts and/or scrapes near my fingernails nor did it sting if it came into contact with them.Product impressionBeing organic there are neither chemical preservatives nor additives. I will admit that I was a bit hesitant to use it at first as I was afraid there may be an unpleasant odor as there were no perfumes. Happily I could not detect any scent at all; as a result I was comfortable using it on both my face and neck. Another bonus is that I had no reaction to the oil. I have sensitive skin and in the past have had some lotions and creams cause small rashes. Since Pura d'Or Argan Oil is organic the lack of chemical additives reduces the likelihood of an uncomfortable skin condition.The oil itself is rather thin; it has the texture of corn oil (meaning it is relatively light) and a pale amber color. The big question of course is whether Pura d'Or Argan Oil leaves a greasy residue. I can say with confidence that it does not - if the directions are followed! The only greasiness that I felt was during the first  seconds after application while it was being absorbed into my skin and/or hair. After that there was no residue and I was able to open doors and perform other tasks without leaving behind any trace that I applied Pura d'Or Argan Oil.Finally if you manage to dribble any Pura d'Or Argan Oil onto your clothing it could leave a grease stain. I was able to use a dry paper towel to blot out any that I did get onto my clothing and subsequently washed it with no lasting harm. I should note that most of my clothing is cotton; I cannot attest to any stains or grease spots that could be left on other fabrics. That being said I do recommend exercising caution so that you do not drip any oil onto your clothing.OverallWhile the price of Pura d'Or Argan Oil may intimidate some as I mentioned earlier you do get what you pay for. You only need a small amount to get the amazing results that I did so your investment will pay off in spades. Between moisturizing my skin conditioning my hair and rejuvenating my fingernails and cuticles Pura d'Or Argan Oil is an amazing product that I wish I had tried sooner. The fact that it is also organic and not tested on animals is a definite plus.In short if you would like a product that will heal your dry skin and also do other amazing things Pura d'Or Argan Oil should be part of your beauty routine. You will find (as I did)that this oil will replace several other beauty products that you have; so while the cost may seem high at first you will no longer need to spend money on lotion conditioner or other ointments. Heck you may even save money by purchasing this product since you will no longer need to spend it on other items. I give Pura d'Or Argan Oil a hearty thumbs up! Pure Gold is an Understatement!,argan oil
It's nourishing and moisturizing.  I could tell the difference after one use; however the scent is overbearing. I am used to wearing essential oils as my perfume (lavender cinnamon etc.) so the chemical pineapple-like smell is not only strong but it is overpowering.My hair texture is super thick so it was nice to feel it nourishing and moisturizing my hair. Great for thick hair.,Neutral
I use this little / oz sample bottle of Tarte Maracuja oil (bought elsewhere for the same price as here so I may buy it from here next time) & love it as my final skincare step before bed. After cleansing I apply a serum followed by a cream (in the winter) & seal in all in w/- drops of maracuja oil. I haven't tried any other brands except Tarte so I can't compare it w/other versions. I love the light texture (reminds me of light sesame seed oil) & I like its purity & gentleness to the skin - doesn't irritate my skin or clog my pores. I understand that maracuja has a high vitamin C content so that's a plus. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or heavy but fresh & soft. It's great for hands cuticles/nails neck & chest also. I don't really rub it in on my face I just pat it on & gently smooth my hands over my face to make sure it covers everything. If I get a big bottle of maracuja oil from another company it would be great to use on legs for winter dryness & for summer sheen. But I reserve my little Tarte bottle just for facial skincare use - I love it.The little dropper bottle (sturdy purple glass) is very pretty & reusable which I like though I admit the push-button dispenser (rather than the traditional rubber squeeze dropper) is a bit of a pain - it dispenses STRICTLY only ONE drop at a time so I have to keep pressing to get multiple drops out. And the pipette never fully fills up. Ah well it's still wonderful & I love it. Would definitely repurchase. I've been using this small bottle for a couple of months now & I still have / remaining so it's very cost effective.It's not perfumed with anything so the natural scent is a light nutty one - which I don't mind except that it has a touch of a rancid oil smell to it which I don't enjoy & I know my bottle isn't rancid - that's just the smell. The less I use the less I smell it & the more I use the more I can smell it for the few minutes that it smells until it sinks in. Light absorbent skin oil,Neutral
GREAT product to use as a facial oil especially during dry months.  No residue skins soaks it up and looks great for hours.  Nice option for the organic switch from perfumey facial lotions.  Thank you! Switched from drugstore lotions**BEST CHOICE,great product
It has a nice smell gives an impression of - year old adult. It has sporty and luxury scent to it.The only drawback is that it wears of very quickly I don't get why these companies are not making actual perfume versions of these as well.But its worth the price I guess. Good but wears of very quickly!,Neutral
This is one of my favorites. The fragrance is very masculine and stays on for hours after you have applied it.Just go easy on the number of sprays....- are good enough to last for - hours... The best perfume I have used,Neutral
The smell is quite strong and perfumey but this product does not leave my hair greasy/ crunchy/ or wet looking. what I was looking for,Neutral
I wish I could buy it by the gallon. Smooth soft and sophisitcated long-lasting and the price is right!! I guess there are REASONS why so many perfumes from Arab states have won Fifi Awards! This is my fave Arab perfume.,Neutral
This come in a gorgeous bottle with a glass applicator its was bigger than I expected. The fragrance starts a with a soft orange like Vanilla and then softens to a warm and pleasant slightly floral musky vanilla. it is lasting but not too strong.This is similar to some of Madini's oils but softer and less concentrated.This is an example of high quality without paying a fortune. High Quality Perfume and the Price is a Steal.,Neutral
I had high hopes for this cream because it received such good reviews.  I've been using it for a while now and haven't noticed much difference in my skin.  I like the fact that it's not perfumed and it goes on smoothly and my face is soft but overall I expected a bit more. Not much lifting and firming going on.,Neutral
Highly recommend this product. As a woman of color my blemishes clears up within weeks even when I don't use my face oils and astringent. it really helps with acne or give u the spa clean face look within  days. I use it to wash my hair and it leaves it super clean. My hair is natural no chemical whatsoever and I don't have the curliest hair but I can manage my hair when it's wet all suds up. As for body your super clean and it help any blemish that you have on your skin. It doesn't have any crazy smell. but if u want a perfume smell I suggest u use ur black soap first and then use ur favorite scent  after. great multipurpose,Neutral
I received this as a gift for my th birthday. I'm a HUGE Bieber fan so this was the perfect gift! I love the smell its very soft and floral-y. I want the girlfriend perfume now too! Beiber Fever!,Neutral
My second favorite Perfume of course sweet!! Doesn't last quite as long as id like but you always smell yummy wearing this ;) I always repurchase this. great,favorite perfume
I was given this as a free sample with a bunch of other perfumes I bought and I sort of laughed but after trying it it smells better than  percent of the other  perfumes I got.  Out of  perfumes I decided to purchase after smelling over  samples this was one of the ones I bought.  I compared it with other light clean pretty scents and it was nicer.  It smells good from start to finish.  Once it's been on the skin for a while it is just a soft subtle pretty scent.It is NOT just for kids.  Kids would be lucky to have such a nice scent.  I think if you put a more mature. handsome guy's name on it middle age and older women would be loving it.  It's getting overlooked and even misjudged sometimes due to the name.I like to wear it when I'm tired of musky spicy or sweet/fruity strong scents.  This is so light and pretty. Really nice.  Great clean pretty soft scent for any age,Neutral
This perfume is geared towards teens but I'm  and I love this stuff! It's a light floral scent that sticks with you all day but isn't overpowering. My boyfriend says it smells like candy and he likes it too! Definitely perfect for every day wear! One of my favorite scents!,Neutral
Not going to lie this is one of my favorite smelling perfumes. Sweet but not too sweet - kind of a fruity/flowery mix. I have a hard time wearing anything Justin Bieber so I don't wear it often... but if I'm rating the product itself it's good! Smells fabulous!,Neutral
Daughter loves it! I admit it does smell nice. Came very quickly in time for Valentines Day. A nice light fruity scent for young girls. Someday Perfume,Neutral
I love someday by Justin bieber. It is a nice fruity and floral sent. With a little vaniella. This perfume is s perfect gift for any girl or woman. You may think its made for girls and teens but its made for everyone. You will deffently fall in love with someday. someday amazed,Neutral
Both bottles leaked my expensive perfume all in my purse i had the ball in correctlyi threw them away. Never again. They leaked,Neutral
I am happy with these except that I had to open them with my teeth. The part that secures the roller ball on is way too intense. It took so much grief to get that off. Balls roll well nice thick glass. They're too big for lip stuff though (to anyone wondering). Probably great for perfume! Good bottles impossible to open.,Neutral
I had an oily perfume that its not in spray I already had one bottle like this one that I got from Avon (with Avon perfume) few years ago and tough it was a good idea but it leaks :(PS: The Avon bottle never leaked (had it for quite few years) It leaks :(,Neutral
These are great bottles to mix oils to make a personalized perfume.  The roller ball makes it easy to apply.  They come in a solid glass one and a swirl pattern.  The roller is not attached until you make the perfume.  These took a while to ship but it is worth the wait. Nice  roll on bottles to make your own perfumes,Neutral
These are Absolutely Perfect for perfume to travel with & I use them for my roll on cosmetic lines...thin serums or liquids. Great product,great product
I carry one of these in my makeup bag. I was a little annoyed that the dropper the product promised wasn't sent with the bottles but whatever. You can only really use perfumes that don't have a permanently attached pump anyway (you'll break the bottles if you try to screw off the pump mechanism which is especially not worth it if your perfume is expensive) which means you can just pour them into the bottles.The cap screws on tight enough to prevent leaks but because it's a rollerball you're likely to get a lot more perfume dispensed than maybe you want especially if the bottle is stored upside down. .,Neutral
Cheap efficient - just what I needed. I love to carry perfume and re-apply with the roller bottle because if you have a mini-atomizer spraying a mist into the air in a public space is sometimes more attention than I want. The roller bottles don't leak and are easy to just touch up a scent mid-day! Great!,Neutral
I like that you an add your own perfume to these and carry them in your purse! what a great idea....they are pretty and they are an excellent price. Can't go wrong great idea and great price,Neutral
I had a broken nozzle on an old perfume bottle so that pretty much prevented me from using the perfume within it for quite some time. But with these I finally wore that perfume again after gently distributing it from the broken nozzle bottle into these roll-on ones. Even though it is not oil based I never had a problem with leaking. Yaaaay,Neutral
I make my own perfume using essential oils Jojoba Oil etc.  These roll on refillable bottles are great especially when using essential oils.  I highly recommend these.  They are very reasonable and work very well - no waste of product when using the roll-on bottles. Great for homemade perfumes,Neutral
Having one smooth and one textured helps me quickly visually recognize two different fragrances. Aside from the chip that's on one albeit a small one that's not such a big deal that I'm willing to deal with the exchange process these are quite cool. They snapped together fairly easily but then I don't know how difficult it'll be to pull the top back off when it's time to change out the contents. I like to put leftover perfume or perfume samples into these so that they're easier to apply and certainly better for travel. Of course if traveling and moving about I'd be a bit concerned with the glass breaking especially considering one of my arrived already chipped. Cool Except for the Chip,Neutral
super cheap and does the job. I toss them in my purse with keys a phone wallet makeup bag....tons of stuff and it never spills or cracks or anything. easy to fill up...disperses just a perfect amount of my favorite perfumes.  a must for when I forget to put perfume on at home. AMAZING!,Neutral
These are great little bottles and I'm actually back to buy  more.  I use one for perfume and the other for my Rx antiperspirant which is a liquid.  The rollers work great and they are quite easy to pop off the lids to refill. Surprisingly useful!,Neutral
Both arrived perfectly fine the shipping was okay and they work so nicely!I carry my oil perfumes on them and I love them!would totally buy these again! Great product!,great product
great for adding spray perfume to use as rollerball and store in your purse - I got a small funnel to do this with all my favs. These are good quality glass and rollerballs.  If rollerball is stiff - run your fingernail around ball to loosen plastic a bit.  I've gotten many of these and always have great luck with them. great,Neutral
When this arrived I was hopeful that it might be just as effective asOlay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion with UV Protection . -Fluid Ounce since it has three out of four of the ingredients of the more expensive Olay product. Alas it was not to be. I don't find this product as effective at smoothing the face and I am not a fan of scented products. The scent in the product though not horrible lasts all day and is simply not the way I want to smell. I did try this on my hands though and eight hours later they still felt softer (and still perfumed).A note to the reviewer that complained about this product bothering her eyes. This product and others like it all warn against getting this in eyes. I suggest that reviewer purchase a moisturizer to use around eyes that is intended solely for that purpose. Not as effective as other products; don't care for scent,Neutral
This lotion works great.  I've been using it on my hands every evening (my hands stay dry and cracked in the winter) and I can definitely tell a difference.  My only complaint is the scent.  It's a bit too strong for me.  I tend to start sneezing when I'm around strong perfumes or strong scents in general and the scent of this lotion makes me sneeze for a few minutes after I put it on.  If strong scents don't bother you this is a wonderful product that does what it advertises. Love all but the scent,Neutral
For the most part I'm loyal to Neutrogena skin care products. I use this face washNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser Pink Grapefruit  Ouncereligiously and it's treated my skin better than any number of fancy department-store brands. And I usually use Neutrogrena moisturizer as well though I use this one:Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture Sensitive Skin  Ounce. The Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is similar to the moisturizer in that it's light and it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy after you apply it. It also holds in plenty of moisture which I'm experienced with since I constantly have to re-apply weaker moisturizers in these bitter Chicago winters. It gets the job done. The only thing that keeps me from giving this product a higher rating is that it has a barely noticeable perfume-y scent that I don't really like. I don't like my face to be scented and especially not my face lotion since I have sensitive skin. If it were scent-less (and there's no mention of scent on the packaging but trust me it's there) I'd give it a . All in all it'll get the job done but if you don't like scented facial lotions this one isn't for you. A nice light moisturizer but I could do without the scent,sensitive skin
I've been a Neutrogena user for years so I'm always happy to try a different product when they pop up on Vine (thank you!). My skin isn't terribly sensitive except around the eyelids where I have problems with eczema and this really didn't help those areas much. Outside of that I found this a very pleasing product not too runny and not too heavy and greasy. It goes on smooth without an oily feeling. I like the pump feature as it's much easier to get without flipping a tube over and squeezing. I like the SPF  protectant although this time of year and the weather we've had I haven't really been able to test drive that feature.I notice other reviewers are commenting on the pleasant fragrance and while it is that (pleasant) there are some folks (like me) who are a bit more sensitive to perfumes and such and it is a tad bit too strong for my personal tastes. I definitely wouldn't put it on immediately before bed as you'll be smelling it for a while against your pillows. It does dissipate after a bit though so I wouldn't avoid purchasing because of that unless you are highly sensitive to frangrances of any sort. No complaints here,Neutral
I'm very picky about moisturizers.  Most of them are too perfumey too greasy too expensive and aggravate my acne.  This product from Neutrogena is one of the best moisturizers I've found.  It's light soothing lasts a while doesn't feel heavy has a very light scent hasn't caused any acne flare-ups and the SPF  is a great bonus.  My dermatologist is always getting on my case and telling me to use SPF  on my face every single day; with this product I may actually be able to comply!  Also I'm a guy and I found the scent to be very pleasant in a clean unisex kind of way.  Highly recommended. Works great,Neutral
It's a cute container. Very cute. But the mist itself I don't like. It spritzes out unevenly and in a small spray so you have to spritz a lot of times and close up to your face. I think the effect is that you get too much liquid on your face at certain spots--whatever it is it's not a mist.Personally I also don't like the fragrance. It's like rosewater + perfume. It dissipates but meh it's a few seconds that I could be enjoying with a nice scent that I spend holding my breath instead. I'm also disappointed because I wanted to take this in my purse but even though it's only oz it's actually bigger and heavier than my other mist that's  oz. Packaging's the best part.,Neutral
Sometimes when the packaging is THIS cute the product is crap. But not this time. The mist is excellent. The consistency is a little thicker than water smells like a light perfume and works really well at keeping my face hydrated. I spray this over my BB creams and foundations when my skin is feeling dry and parched. Love this mist! Excellent mist!,Neutral
I bought Ojon Damage Reverse Restorative Hair Treatment a long time ago could be around  years ago I had still some of the old one when I bought the new one very recently and I felt the old formula was stronger and better the smell was stronger and the color was darker this new one is lighter color and the smell still smoky smell but with a little bit of perfume in it like the company is trying to disguise the strong smoky smell adding some of other good scent in it. I mean still a good product but I don't feel it as good as the old formula. The smell was never a problem for me it's true the smell is kind of strong smell but really the smell goes away when you wash your hair what I would do with a good smelling product without good results!!! the good smell isn't everything especially with products for the hair and the skin I really want on first place good results and second or third place the good smell. Was much better the old formula.,little bit
Due to my work and school schedule I often have bags under my eyes. Ones that occasionally look big enough to store a family's winter wardrobe in. Because of this I'm always eager to try the various skin tighteners/lotions that come up in Vine. I want something that works well enough but doesn't stink to high heaven like some of the other alternatives do.Now when it comes to this product it has some pluses and minuses. For some my minuses won't be that bad for others it'll be a deal breaker like it sort of was for me.Pros: This doesn't stink nor does it have a particularly bad perfume smell. If anything the smell here is incredibly muted and almost nonexistent. It does have a pleasant smell but not one that came from tons of perfumes. It always surprises me that so many companies haven't realized that many people don't want their facial products to have a ton of perfume in it. Sometimes it's nice but when it's something like lotion that remains on your skin for hours it's not always a good thing. The other thing I liked was that this went on nice and smooth. It's creamy and a little goes a long way when it comes to your skin which will be something a lot of people will appreciate.Cons: It's oily too oily for me. I could feel that this has an oil base in it when applying but I assumed that it'd just absorb into the skin. Not so- this still felt a little oily later on when I went to touch it later to see if it made the skin smooth and soft. For me this is a deal breaker since my skin can get oily and the last place I want to get clogged skin is under my eyes. Note that this oily feeling wasn't the same as how my skin can feel when producing its own natural oils.However I did notice a difference in my skin in that the bags weren't as bad as they normally are. I also have to say that other than the slightly oily feeling my skin was soft. It would be something I'd probably recommend for someone with drier skin perhaps. Works well enough but is too oily for me,long way
I am in my mid s and have dry skin and the beginning of fine lines and I recently tried this withL'Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream - . oz..  While I thought the face cream was too thick and perfume-y I really liked this eye cream!  It's nice and thick and made me think it was doing something!I will say I think it's a little expensive for the amount you get - about  weeks' worth I estimate.  Amazon has a good price right now but if I'd paid full price I would have been ticked off.  Also if I had to buy an eye cream I would buy one with retinol in it.  This one does not have retinol.  But it seems to be hydrating so if that's all you're looking for give this a try! Review from a -something with dry skin,dry skin
I been Using this since highschool And omg This is really a love spell it smells soso good ... I remember when i was walking passed this cute guy and he was like Omg love spell who has on that perfume on ...guys love it girls love it ....its a must have I Love it,Neutral
I adore this smell and I always have but maybe i should buy the perfume version this body mist fades so fast! I've heard the perfume also fades quickly but I love the scent so much I'm going to try it anyways! Smells great fades fast,Neutral
got it early took a lot to open the box felt like I was opening a present well rapt lol any ways im so picky with perfumes so I have to smell it first so I did was kinda like ok but once I spray it on me it was a different smell so that was good I like it will be ordering more in the future victorias love spell,Neutral
I first found out about this product from a friend who was a beautician. She used this on my hair and I was amazed by how great this worked! The smell of it is amazing! I could wear it as a perfume and if you can go a day or two without washing your hair it creates an even sweeter smell to your hair. I have thick and natural curly blonde hair and blow drying typically use to take me near almost - minutes just to get my hair completely dry and round brushed. With this product it takes me - minutes tops! It really does cut down the dry time and if they had a perfume of this smell I'd purchase that and use it like I use butter!! Avid user!,Neutral
The CLEARASIL ULTRA OVERNIGHT SCRUB didn't keep me from breaking-out but it did seem to make the pimples go away quicker than normal.Usually I'll breakout with one or two small to medium sized pimples that would take about a week to clear up sometimes leaving a mark behind. After using the SCRUB for about  months I noticed that the pimples didn't last as long and that probably has to do with the salicylic acid that causes the skin to breakdown and repair itself faster basically shedding dead skin cells faster so I'm sure that had a lot to do with it.I didn't use it everyday which would be too drying for my skin type -- normal/oily combination -- and so I would use it every two to three days and only once a day. BTW I also use an SPF moisturizer in the day time to combat dryness and to protect from UV rays because your skin tends to be hypersensitive to sunlight while using these types of products. If you have a sensitivity to salicylic acid this could be too drying for your skin.The SCRUB didn't lather too much and had larger granules than say Pro-Activ Face Wash and it has that odd smell like medicinal perfume. Anyway if you don't like the abrasive scrubs CLEARASIL also hasClearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask: . OZ but I found that one to be really drying until my skin adjusted to it. *Seems* To Work But I Still Break-Out!,Neutral
Clearasil Ultra Overnight Scrup has a pleasing texture that includes exfoliating beads. I've used the product for a few weeks and it works very well. It fights redness and clears up blemishes.My one complaint and I find it to be pretty significant is the product's smell. For the life of me I don't understand why each and every skin product has to be scented. I don't need my overnight acne medicine to be perfumed! It's distracting and gets in the way of my sleep. If a product must be scented why not something faint and herbal like peppermint or lavender? Works but why does it have to be perfumed?,Neutral
Here is my brief review:Scent - Perfume like a bit too sweet in my opinion I prefer cleaner scent like soap etcTexture - OK on the oily/heavy sideGrains - good! more than in other similar productsResults - to be honest except for me feeling cleaner I never really see results from these products.Hope you'll find this helpful :) Good amount of grains OK on the rest,Neutral
I have high hopes of creating my own little vials of perfumed oil and this seemed like a better way to apply than a spritz bottle. I've only used one as of today and it makes applying myBody Dew Silky Body Oil w/Pheromones -  oz Originalso much easier than the spray bottle it comes in. Side note: don't have a clue if those pheromones are working but it smells divinely of Gardenia. All  bottles arrived in two separate baggies enclosed in a padded envelope... inside my box of other items. I appreciate the extra care in packaging since they're glass. They're so simple to put together. Just add your product firmly push in the roller ball until it *snaps* and sits flush with the rim of the glass and Voila!... you're ready to roll.Update Jan.  : I've now used about five more of these and each one is perfect. I've made some perfume with essential oils that require shaking everyday for a few weeks before they can be used and there's NO leaking at all. Love these little roll-ons! The first one works perfectly,Neutral
We asked the seller to ship us  of each size. They all arrived nicely bubble wrapped.  These are great fro taking perfume on the go. Works much better than spray bottles which seem to vaporize half of what they spray out.  And these don't leak at all either. Very happy with them and the swirly design is nice too. Great Deal,Neutral
Fantastic for traveling.  Great for putting your favorite perfume and take in you purse.  Very convenient to use instead of having the big bottle on the counter. Great Price,favorite perfume
Like others have said just a dab'll do ya with this stuff.  I'm very pale and this blends nicely with my skin tone.  It gets a little caked inside my pores but that's not terribly noticeable.  My  year-old son likes to sniff my face when I wear it because it has a very pleasant perfume-y smell but this might not be good for someone with allergies or sensitive skin.  I expect it will take me a very long time to go through this tube so I feel it was a good value. Pretty good but a little weird at first.,long time
I'm going to start by saying that I have sensitive/combination skin. Though that doesn't really seem like it exists it definitely exists. I have used practically every acne cleanser out there (all natural soaps from Thailand Singapore Cleansers from France Germany America cheap stuff expensive stuff kits over the counter and prescription stuff) in hopes that something out there will finally save me from my own face. But nothing ever did. So for the last  years I have been caking my skin with all different types of makeup products in hopes that I can look in the mirror and kind of feel normal.[Side note: after getting the CO Laser Treatment done on my skin I realized it made my skin slightly more sensitive than before. Makeup toner cleansers treatment etc. I used prior to treatment are now too harsh for my skin.]BB Cream - Holika Holika: Pore Clearing Petit BB Cream with Tea Tree Oil and Sebum Control Powder - Made in Korea: My youngest sisters are huge K-POP fans. They talk highly of South Korea and it's advancements all the time. Today I am sitting at  months post procedure and I'm still struggling to find a foundation that ) is kind to my skin ) won't make me break out ) doesn't feel like I've been wearing it for  hours when it's only been on for . Well I was until today. A couple of days ago I decided to give BB cream another chance but this time I looked to the other end of the earth. I looked on amazon and found many MANY positive reviews on Korean cosmetics. I found the Holika Holika BB Cream with Tea Tree Oil and here is what I have to say:Surprisingly amazing coverage. Though I have had laser on my skin done I do have some red scarring from acne appearing afterwards. This covers them very very well.It comes in a small tube (about  Fl. Oz) but a little goes a long way!! I used a pea sized amount and was successfully able to cover my entire face! I looked clean and fresh. (Reviews on Amazon.com said the same which is one of the biggest reasons why I chose to give this cream a chance)The cream smells good in my opinion. It smells exactly how a cream should smell. That nice sweet lotion smell. Not the smothered in perfumes &#;i'm going to clog your pores!&#; smell.It contains tea tree oil. Ever since I had to stop using BP .% because it became too harsh for my skin to handle tea tree oil and I have become best of friends (I dilute it with my Thayers Witch Hazel Oil every morning after cleansing and night before bed as a toner). I've never encountered a makeup containing tea tree oil.It doesn't have the &#;i'm wearing makeup&#; feel to it. Normally after spending about  minutes gently applying my foundation it only takes my skin a couple of minutes to notice it's there and start irritating me. This BB cream left my skin feeling the same amazing fresh gentle soft feel I get every night after cleansing toning and moisturizing. Normally at the end of the day I can't wait to wash my face but this cream makes me feel fresh and clean for hours.SPF . Post-procedure I am required to wear sunscreen. Unfortunately I tried a few tinted sunscreens provided to my by Harmony Laser Center and they were all just too greasy for me and most foundations do not contain a high SPF (at least not in my experience)For a cream perfected by South Korea in  I'd trust them any day over Olay Rimmel Maybelline companies only adding the product to their line recently. If you're struggling to find a good BB cream give this one a go. Read the reviews and see what you think. I paid $. for it on Amazon and I couldn't be happier. Let me know what you think. Thanks! koreans perfected BB cream long ago,long way
I have used several bb creams both american and Korean and this is one of my favorites.  It is very good for dry skin it moisturizes and blends very well into skin.  I would consider it light coverage it evens out skintone and brightens but is not super heavy which I actually like.  This one also seems to be more of a creamy nude color than a fair ivory color and would probably be good for people who find other bb creams too pale/grey.  It seems to be very mild doesn't clog or break out my skin.  No perfumey smell and works well with or without a primer.  I can tell you this is better by far than ANY American BB Cream I've tried and the best part is even with shipping it's a lot less expensive. Please bear in mind when you order products that come direct from Korea IT TAKES LONGER. Keep this in mind when ordering.  These types of products are worth it though. Very natural moisturizing bb cream,dry skin
Yet another great scent by Marc Jacobs. After smelling this at Dillard's the other day I just had to buy it. Not only is it absolutely gorgeous with it's flower-shaped lid it smells even better! I didn't think I would like it as I don't really care for the smell of it's older sister Lola but I think I've fallen in love. Whereas the original Lola perfume is very strong and almost musky this version is very light feminine and even a bit sweet. A great buy for a woman of any age: young or old. Oh Lola!,Neutral
You know how it is you get a fragrance in your mind from the past that you remember was soothing and made you feel happy safewarm and delicious inside but you can't put your finger on what it was? This is what &#;Oh Lola by Marc Jacobs&#; is for me! It is soft soothing and my husband wants to stick his nose to my neck all day. If this is any indicator of how wonderful this perfume is I think that is a good thing sort of  because we have been married for  years and are really really use to each other.  It can get annoying though since he can't seem to keep his hands off of me. If you don't mind having your husband or sweetheart plastered to you a lot this is a wonderful flirty effervescent yet warm floral fragrance that gets better as it blends with your own body chemistry. I was looking for a soothing perfume,Neutral
I purchased this perfume BRAND NEW and Sealed in the plastic. It smells very pretty perfect for the spring and summer. But it does not last. It's smells very strong at first spray but then three minutes later the fragrance disappears. I spent a lot of money on this and it's very disappointing that it doesn't last. Now I just have a fragrance that stays on my dresser for decoration. Fades Fast,Neutral
I bought this without ever having smelled it before because I'm a huge fan of Marc Jacobs perfumes and this one sounded great. No surprise LOVE the scent! Like others have mentioned you do need a few sprays of it to get the full scent and you will probably have to reapply a time or two during the day but it's worth the time! The plastic floral cap is cute but it is sort of large and cumbersome (larger than it looks in the picture) but I can't see that being a reason not to buy. Love it! Bought Smell-Unseen and Love it!,Neutral
I was recently on vacation in Utah and did a bit of shopping at the outlet stores. I picked up this gem at a Perfumania store. I asked the clerk for perfumes that I had run out of and unfortunately they did not have any of them however she recommended this one when I stated I was looking for a summer fragrance. When I first smelled the scent on a test strip I like it but was not thrilled about it. However it was the best I thought out of the ones she suggested and my boyfriend liked it (which is important). Wearing it today makes me change my tone I adore this scent. Very soft subtle floral scent. Does not evaporate quickly like some perfumes it stays. The .oz/ml is a large bottle an the flower is made out of flexible soft translucent rubber/plastic very attractive sitting out.Update // - When I was on the elevator this morning a woman commented to me that I smelled nice. She said the scent was a very nice scent a light summery floral perfume and of course I told her what it was. I'm very glad I sprung for this perfume. Perfect light summer scent...,Neutral
This is one of my new favorite perfumes! It smells like exotic flowers and fruit! It is fancy but also playful at the same time and that is why i love it so much. I love this perfume it's awesome! Fancy but playfull smelling!,Neutral
This perfume is amazing... youthful playful SEXY. Guys cannot get enough of it! So much better than regular euphoria. The only thing I would change is to exchange some of its strong projection for some more longevity. But other than that... perfection.By the way if you're looking for a daytime version of this scent check out  Sexy! Best ever,Neutral
This is my favorite perfume. It's very feminine and lasts a long time. I;m sure to get compliments when I'm wearing it! My favorite,favorite perfume
I've been using this lotion since early in high school and I'm now in my senior year of college. Sometimes I'll try something new but it just never compares to this lotion and I go back. I get a lot of complements on the smell. I used to have really dry skin and even had eczema at one point before I ever used this. I haven't had dry skin problems since I started using this lotion. As soon as I get out of the shower I put it on and it absorbs into your skin well and instantly makes it super soft all day long. The one thing I could see being bothersome to some people is how strong the smell is and could make headaches to some. On the same note since the smell is so strong I believe it's best to not wear perfume with it as it already does that job too. Great Lotion,dry skin
I bought this on a lark when I visited a popular chain drugstore.  Fortunate for me they had a sale going on all Shea Moisture brands including the baby products.  Most of the baby products was gone except for the lone lotion and I picked up something from the Shea Moisture body care line.  When I applied this lotion I was blown away by the fragrance but in a good way.  The best way I can describe the scent is that to me it smells like cream soda suckers by Dum-Dums.  To add it kind of reminds me of old fashion cream soda or dare I say a softer version of Root Beer.  I know I might not be accurate but to me and on my body (due to the body chemistry) it smells like cream soda candy.  Usually I am not the one to get excited about gourmand scents but this one I can definitely get behind.  Also I feel that this scent is pretty unisex so if your significant other accidentally uses it he might be reluctant to wash it off.I also liked the fact that a little goes a long way.  I bought my bottle almost three months ago and I have about one-fourth to a third left and that is basically using it every other day.  I do tend to switch it up because I want to switch it up and I don't have perfumes compliments it.  The only con for me is that it is kind of pricey but the good thing is that I can catch it on sale.  That is the prime time to stock up.  In short I would totally recommend this to a friend and maybe borrow from her. A non-traditional fragrance for babies but I love it for myself,long way
I have been using Batiste's Original Formula Dry Shampoo for at least  years to control my greasy/oily hair.  I saw this for medium brunette hair a few weeks ago and thought I'd try it.  No way can I use this stuff.  It smells like really strong hair spray and unlike hairspray the smell does not go away or dissipate at all.  This product made me sneeze when I first put it on and the smell made me feel like sneezing all day.  And I am not a person that sneezes a lot.  I have no allergies at all and do not sneeze around heavy perfume when applying hairspray (which I rarely do) etc.  But this made even me sneeze.  I am tossing this product ASAP and going back to the Batiste Original Formula.  It works fine on my brown hair.  It goes on white-ish.  But if I brush it a bit more the white goes away.  Amazon sells this original formula and if you are an Amazon Prime member you even get free shipping on the original scent/formula. NOT impressed,Neutral
Some dry shampoos leave a chemical or cheap perfume odor.  This one does not.  It adds a lot of volume to my fine hair as well as soaking up oils.  Supposedly it adds extra &#;brunette&#; color but I don't notice any. It does not smell like cheap perfume.  It adds volume as well as soaking up oil.,Neutral
Not only does this perfume not last it does not smell so nice-- it smells like an old lady perfume! I absolutely love Fancy by Jessica Simpson but this one doesn't tickle mine AT ALL! Too Amazon had to send me another bottle as my first one had leaked so badly the paint was coming off the bottle and the entire boxed was soaked in it :-(ETA: I still use this fragrance (layered with Bath & Bodyworks lotions) & I am complimented a lot! This stuff sucks... but apparently smells good on me to others!,Neutral
I ordered this perfume with gimmy chu perfume from amazon. I did not like it at all. It has a different fragrance than what you get in store. Please do not buy any perfume from amazon. Fake.,Neutral
This perfume smells really good and it last all day. The scent is very sweet soft and very feminine  you will get lots of compliments everytime you wear it. So if you want great smelling perfume that is not going to break your bank please try this one You will not regret it. The scent not over-powering just beautiful. I love this perfume so much I am giving them out as gift for christmas. really good scent,Neutral
this perfume smells heavenly and I would recommend this. this perfume smells great and is slightly floral/fruity scent and is very romantic and alluring. this perfume is a little stronger than the perfume I usually use s by shakira but it still smells good and seems to stay on well. the bottle is really pretty and fancy looking. this size bottle . ounce is a great bargain for the price. what else can i say it smells good and is inexpensive. I Fancy You . ounce,Neutral
I just got this today....has a hint of a rose/Lilly smell to it at least to me. The bottle is cute in design. I sprayed some on an hour ago the scent holds up but not as strong as when I first applied it it appears to have worn off a bit. I think Fancy (I believe her first perfume) is a better perfume. I Fancy You...is lighter airy and is not over powering but it appears to not last very long. I'd consider it a daytime perfume/scent. Overall not a bad perfume but its not a overwhelmingly favorite of mine. However it still has its charm. Still like u Jessica...:/,Neutral
Sorry I have to give this perfume  stars. I've been looking for a heavier perfume for date nights but its been difficult since I can't stand such full perfumes. Almost every perfume I've tried (that would be suitable for nights) are overly sweet and leave me gagging. Thankfully this one is sweet but not so much so that it leaves my stomach turning. I'm still not a huge fan and I believe the people saying this perfume is light are out of their minds...but then again I exclusively use much lighter scents such as Revert and Curve Chill.Thinking on it a little more I'm changing my review to a four star just for the fact that I can actually stand to wear this one.I generally have fairly oily skin but right now its still really dry from the winter and this perfume seems to last fairly long. Doesnt Gag Me,Neutral
I got this for myself and love it. I have all of my perfume bottle displayed on my dresser. I ordered this because of the bottle. But when I got it I realized I really liked it. It's not overbearing it's really a light scent. I wear it to work. Wonderful,Neutral
I love this! It is very flowery and girly which is nice when you want to add a touch of flirtatiousness to a lock. I just wish it had just a tiny hint of vanilla to help complete and blend it the perfume i think it would have been better if they had done that but oh well. It can be very strong so don't use to much btw! I really love this though its great! Great!,Neutral
Buying perfume online can often be a gamble but I am very happy about this purchase. I am  years old and was looking for something not overwhelming to wear on a daily basis and this fits me perfectly. It's light girly and playful. Love this perfume!,Neutral
I got this because my aunt was wearing it and it smelled amazing very pleasant and flowery but not over the top where you will get natious or migraines which the both of us tend to get easily well migraines  anyway she told me it was this one so eager I looked it up found it on amazon and it had great reviews well I am now one of those great reviewers ! This perfume smells amazing not per powering at all lasts a good while :) I got plenty of compliments on it and the price is great as well the quality is perfect came safely bubble wrapped and inside its proper coach box and it is no where near a fake % real my aunt got hers at Macys and I got mine here and they smell exactly the same bottles a decent size ....botttom line of you like floral sweet fragrances then this one is for you :) Floral and sweet !:),Neutral
I had tried this out in Macy's back in November and I fell in love. I waited till I found a decent price on amazon because a lot of stores wanted outrageous prices for it. I can't describe the notes dead on but it's not all floral notes. It's not weak nor is it strong. This is one my favorite perfumes the bottle my only complaint is I'm not sure if it's just my bottle but the top can sometimes be hard to pull off. If you ever want to get an idea about notes and reviews about perfumes try out websites specially for perfumes where people review them. Any of you wondering where I got mine from I ordered mine from FragranceNet. It was a legit that I got sent AND the bottle came in a box wrapped and I got two free samples with my order and a free handheld mirror. I'm very happy with with my purchase and I hope you try it out for yourselves! My favorite floral perfume ever!,Neutral
I have never used any facial moisturizers before trying this product and I would never have tried it if I hadn't been able to get it through the Vine program.  I have never been a fan of moisturizing I rarely use hand cream or body lotion because I don't like the way they feel and the perfume smells irritate me.  I do like Jergens lotions and I will use that but that's the only moisturizer I like.I have notice that the elasticity in my skin is diminishing and my face is getting wrinkly so I was happy to have the chance to try this expensive serum.  I have to say that I have been pleased with the feel of this on my skin and while it does have a scent to it I don't mind the smell at all.  I guess you're supposed to put this on before bed but I use it in the morning instead. And I like the texture of this product under my concealer it's a little bit tacky and seems to give my concealer something more to stick to than just my smooth skin so I get better coverage with the concealer.Do I think this product is making me look younger? Well someone held the door for me the other day and called me Miss instead of Ma'am...does that count?I think this product is a nice moisturizer that does make my skin look better and my make-up go on better and it doesn't have an irritating smell to it.  So I do like it.  But I have to be honest I am a bargain-shopping kind of girl and I would never spend big bucks on any beauty product probably not even if I won the lottery.  If I could get a life-time supply of this serum gratis I'd be happy to keep using it. Never Used A Facial Moisturizer Before,little bit
I was excited for the opportunity to sample and review one of the high end facial products but that quickly turned to disappointment.  I do not have sensitive skin but one use and I had red blotches across my forehead. The scent was very strong almost perfumed rather than just scented. Why is that even needed on a facial product? I'll continue to try the products on my hands to use them up but this is not a product i would ever pay for or recommend. Oil of Olay is a better bet for your money. Irritating,sensitive skin
As a -year-old woman with very fair skin I take my skin-care regime and the products I use very seriously. Even with a great deal of care there comes a time when we all start to notice experience lines and look for the products that can help us minimize the impact on our look.  Unfortunately I am going to have to keep looking.The product barely made an impact on the fine lines on my face.  I followed the application procedures and applied it under one eye hoping to be able to judge the comparison. Even after waiting for a bit I saw no real difference.  What I did see was so slight that I wondered if it was down to wishful thinking.  The next day when I tried this same application on the other eye I called my husband in to see if he could pick the eye that had been treated.  Sadly he could not.  I tried it for several days with the hopes that perhaps there would be some sort of cumulative effect but there was not.  It did seem to make the skin feel a bit more soft so at least there was that.Even if the product had worked the dispenser was horrible.  It reminded me of the cheap perfume samples they hand out sometimes at the mall.  The pump barely moves at all and when it does you either get nothing or a double-dose.  Considering the price of this little bottle you would think they could put more effort into the dispenser.I cannot recommend this product as much better results can be had with a simple moisturizer applied twice daily. Mediocre product with a horrible dispenser,Neutral
This is a great perfume! My friend introduced it to me and I love it. Only negative? I wish it had a lot more staying power! Yummy,Neutral
Fell inlove with this perfume a few years ago. Doesn't disappoint. Beautiful non-overpowering scent. Will appeal to young girls as well as -somethings. Gorgeous scent,Neutral
Non-irritating with a silky smooth feel. I've used this bottle of Argan oil almost everyday about five out of seven days each week since my initial purchase (about two months ago). My hair loves it and the best part -- my skin does too! No added perfumes or scents just the pure oil. It's a bit pricey for the size but a good purchase nevertheless. Good stuff,argan oil
Argan oil was recommended on The Beauty Department to use on your hair before heat styling. I switched to argan oil from a shine serum that contains alcohol which can actually dry out your hair.  I've been using it a few weeks and I like it! It comes in a little glass bottle with a dropper and I tend to use about - drops in my damp hair before blow drying and then maybe  or so more after finishing with the flat iron to add more shine. I've also used it on my arms and legs (about  or  drops) to add a pretty sheen especially when I wear tanks and shorts. It doesn't have much of a scent so it doesn't interfere with lotion or perfumes. Gives my hair and skin a healthy shine,argan oil
I really love this cleanser! I have used all kinds of cleansers and I'm so impressed with the way this product works. It takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin so smooth. I don't generally use waterproof mascara so don't know how it does with that stuff but for every day mascara no problem. It also smells heavenly without actually smelling like putting perfume on your face. Great product all around would recommend it to anyone. Great day/night cleanser,great product
I have wavy frizzy super long and thick hair and was looking for something to tame the lion's mane that was not greassy or silicone based. I found this product at the store and took it home to try it. I washed my hair (I use a cleansing conditioner) and put on three times as much as it says on the label (my hair reaches all the way down to my waist) distributed it all over and then held my hair to the side and turn it to make a curl. I left it like this until it was dry. When the hair dried out there was no frizz and the curls were nice loose and soft. Next day same thing no frizz. Third day went to the gym no frizz and still nice curls. It did the job for me...for my kind of hair. The perfume they put on it was driving me a little crazy the first day but then it went away by the third day. I eventually washed my hair after visiting the gym :P so I don't know how many days it can last. It was not sticky or heavy I could not feel anything on my hair. I really love it! It worked for me,Neutral
This shampoo felt great in the shower. It bubbled up okay (not as many bubbles as sulfate shampoo but there was a decent lather) and my hair didn't feel squeaky and overstripped after I rinsed. It did feel clean though. After I used the matching conditioner my hair felt baby soft... while it was wet. When I got out of the shower and let it air dry it felt awful. It was stiff dull and straw-like. A few days later I used this stuff again with the same result.I eventually used a different shampoo with the EverCreme conditioner and my hair felt normal afterward so I've come to the conclusion that my hair just doesn't like this particular shampoo. Also the smell was a bit too perfumey for my taste (it lingers for awhile too) but I could tolerate it. So if you're the type who dislikes hair products with strong smells I don't recommend trying anything from the EverCreme line because they all have the same perfume type scent. Meh.,Neutral
The top layer of my hair often gets frizzy and dry to the touch perhaps because it takes the brunt of the hot steamy water and gets quickly stripped of natural oils as well. I have been trying to find ways to moisturize and tame this layer without adding a bunch of gunky products. I have very light fine hair that gets oily quickly and the last thing I want to do is weigh it down with extra things that COST extra as well!I don't expect to find ONE product that is the panacea for all my hair troubles but this shampoo has certainly done wonders for me. My hair has been noticeably smoother shinier and more hydrated and I have less issues with frizz. Granted I have been coupling this with L'Oreal's Eversleek smoothing conditioner hoping that the two combined would help to both hydrate and smooth frizz. I have been happy with the results so far.Icing on the cake: It smells amazing. While this breaks down to pure preference I find that although others may dislike it or find it way too strong I fell in love the minute I opened the bottle. I'm REALLY sensitive to strong scents and perfumes and this does not bother me at all. By the time I wash it out my hair dries it becomes more subtle as well. It has a floral creamy almost dessert-like scent to it without being too childish (as I've found some smells like vanilla cupcake or pineapple can sometimes come off as a bit unprofessional sometimes if you think people will be able to smell your products at work). I don't think anyone can smell your hair with this shampoo however without getting their noses in it.I also love that this item is not tested on animals especially since L'Oreal has been said to do this with their products in the past (I am not sure if they do with other lines). It is sulfate and silicone free which is GREAT for your hair and it will mean you won't have to worry about all that nasty buildup that can weigh down and affect your hair over time. It's best to be as natural with your hair as possible! I am glad this line allows me to do that.So that those reading this review can weigh my results with all other factors involved: I also use this shampoo with a heat treatment (chi silk infusion) to help protect my hair when I blow dry it although I always blow dry on a setting only warm enough to get my hair dry without destroying it. In the mornings I may use Tigi's Bedhead Afterparty to smooth flyaways but I find with L'Oreal's shampoo and conditioner line I have had to use it less and less. I have been able to get up brush my hair and go. But then again my hair is very straight and does not usually require any extra styling beyond some volume. :)The ONLY con I can think of is that I have a slight issue with dandruff and while this shampoo most certainly does not make it worse it does not really help it either. I can't dock any stars for this however because I know it is not a medicated shampoo or a product specific to my problem. I just thought I would mention it for those who may suffer from the same thing.Overall love this shampoo and love the price. I will continue to buy unless I am lucky enough to find a shampoo that can yield the same results and help with my scalp as well. Improvement in my hair already,Neutral
In my quest to find the best and most affordable products to protect my hair I&#;ve come across this awesome product! I&#;ve come to the conclusion that I&#;ve been using the wrong shampoo all my life and made the recent switch to sulfate-free which made a huge difference. But I wanted to go further. My scalp gets so oily that going a day without washing is out of the question. I&#;ve been wanting to try Wen but the reality is &#; I just can&#;t justify spending that much money. So glad I found L&#;Oreal&#;s cleansing conditioner. One less product to use on my hair is a time and money saver. I love that it&#;s sulfate-free and really does cleanse and condition at the same time. Making the switch has worked wonders for my hair. I use it almost every day in place of shampoo and conditioner. But once a week I wash with a sulfate-free shampoo just to get rid of any buildup.The only thing I really didn&#;t like at first was the strong perfumy-smell kind of like cocoa butter.  However I have gotten compliments on it people asking what perfume I&#;m wearing and saying that they love how I smell. My hair is healthier,Neutral
I like this well enough its very similar to hair one and wen.The smell of this product is not my favorite more similar to a perfume then a conditioner.  I like that its a cleanser as well as a conditioner but the product hair one is better for that purpose. not my favorite smell,Neutral
I am a Cleansing Conditioner addict and have been for about  years or so.  I have thin fine straight hair that is almost to my waist.I started with WEN and loved it but it is too crazy expensive. I have Hair One and really like a couple of their varieties. But I always like to try new stuff.  I absolutely LOVE Herbal Essences Naked cleansing conditioner!  It makes my hair soft and light and moisturized.  I also picked up some L'Oreal EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner at the drugstore.  This stuff is SO GROSS!  The scent is like a bad commercial perfume and sticks with you all day overpowering and clashing with any perfume you might decide to wear. Even though I used plenty (I know that Cleansing Conditioners usually take a lot to do the job) and rinsed like CRAZY my hair when dried was matted clumpy and tangly.  I tried it a few different times and ended up throwing almost half of the bottle in the garbage!  Nasty nasty stuff!!! If I could give it zero stars I would!,Neutral
If you don't have any chemical sensitivities then maybe this product won't give you any issues but if you do  please stay away!This has to be the worst smelling product I've ever used.  It smells like burning metal with an old man's musk cologne on top trying to cover it up.  It's truly awful.I washed my hair several times to get the scent out but it just clung to it even the next day when I went to work my colleague asked me if I was trying a new perfume when I told her what it was she was glad I wouldn't be using it again because it was so horrible she didn't want to have to smell it everyday!This product taught me a lesson next time I'm going to look for something with more natural ingredients which hopefully won't give me an awful headache like this one did. Worst Smelling Product I've Ever Used.,Neutral
I used this product for a couple of months.  I was really excited about it since I wanted to try the Wen line but am allergic to aloe (which this product does not contain).  It didn't damage my hair.  It made my showers quicker.  And it smelled like Victoria's Secret's Heavenly perfume.  But after a while I noticed that my hair which had never been glossy by any means looked much duller than usual.  I switched back to a shampoo/conditioner combo and my hair bounced right back.  I'm going to assume that it wasn't enough of a cleanser for my hair...and that it was leaving build up behind. Not for Me,Neutral
I buy my wen from a certain home shopping network and its about four times more expensive than this. However loreal ever cream stinks like a lot of other people said. It smells like a cheap vanilla little girls perfume. Sickeningly sweet. Sure its a moisturizing substitute but it doesn't make my hair strong or bouncy or as healthy as wen. If you compare ingredients wen has many more moisturizing strengthening good for your hair ingredients. So if you just want a regular conditioner get loreal. If you want one with a lot of beneficial ingredients for your hair get wen. Its WAY worth the price in my opinion. Not nearly as good as wen but / price...so you decide,Neutral
i had to do a whole nother review on this and give it only one star cuz i wanted to update and give it another chance. i wanted to like it and use it again....but i couldnt stand the smell!! dont get me wrong it smells nice but wow its too strong!! it cleaned my hair pretty good too and who knows if it really wouldve improved it over time but i couldnt even sleep at night i woke up at  am and all i could smell was that musky scent. not even a perfume like Alien Absolute which is very strong can compete. i surprised i didnt get a headache but i was nearly nauseous....i never had a product that i had to throw away cuz of the smell its the first one...to any Loreal people reading this: please make this w/ another scent thats less strong or at least tone it down! i smelled ur other shampoos and conditioners and they had a fresh smell. i would definitely buy it if it had no scent or a toned-down smell...thanks RIDICULOUSLY STRONG SMELL!!,Neutral
I bought this because of the reviews that said it was JUST as good as WEN cleansing conditioner.  I've been using WEN for  weeks so today I decided to give this a try.  I must say it's not bad.  I feel like WEN is superior in a head to head match up but for the price and availability I was impressed.Pros:  It leaves your hair silky and softer than the average shampoo and conditioner it smells nice (yes it does) and it's cheap in comparison to WEN.Cons:  It's not a good detangler and the pump is ridiculously small for the amount you have to use.  You mine as well take the top of and squeeze the bottle. The bottle is way too small you won't get many uses out of it if you have longer hair.Summary:  If you can't afford WEN this is a nice product.  It's sulfate paraben and harmful salt free and it's vegan.  Some say the smell is too loud and too musky.  I DO NOT like musky smells but this has a nice vanilla smell after it's been rinsed and dried... it's not bad at all unless you hate vanilla or are super sensitive to perfume.  ALL in all I would and will recommend this product to friends.  Just don't expect a miracle and you won't be disappointed. Not quite WEN,Neutral
I have a prof cosmetology license and go to the Prof Only Beauty Supply stores a few times per week.  I am accumulated a huge collection of shampoos and conditioners I would guess at least !  I can go to the beauty supply store and buy any Salon Only Shampoo (Redken Goldwell Chi ect) for the same price if not less than the Loreal EverCreme and I STILL always go back to the EverCreme...It's THAT good!  I have mid-back length super thick wavy hair that I bleach or color at least x a month sometimes every week! This shampoo is so rich it really helps out my fried hair.  It smells like a Givenchy perfume I used to wear abt  yrs ago...mmm..I love it!  It's also super versitle if you have thick unruly hair add a bit of hair oil (argan or coconut work for me) the night before or  min before washing to really soften and reduce friction THEN  deep condition AFTER using the shampoo..PURE TAMED SILK!  If you have fine hair just use the shampoo no conditioner and you will have bouncy soft hair...and it cuts out a sep. conditioner...really I have tons of shampoos that sell for over $ in the salon and the one closest to my heart my true favorite the best performing is EverCreme.  I've gotten everyone I know hooked on it! MY FAVE shampoo in my HUGE collection!!!,Neutral
I always expect L'Oreal products to be heavy on the scent but I must admit I was flabbergasted at how strong-smelling this hair product is. I tried it right away after receiving it on my hair after showering. I have never dyed my hair have a simple straight haircut and haven't permed it in years. I don't even use hair dryers or curlers. My hair is very very long and baby-fine. And yes it gets a little frizzy sometimes as you might guess so I'm always on the lookout for products that help control that frizziness.I've tried it for a week so far applying it every other day and in differing amounts ( pumps seems to work better for me than - which isn't too surprising given the sheer amount of hair I have). It's a very thin liquid of shampoo consistency that doesn't wash off the hands very easily after use. The package advises to use it mostly on the ends which I can agree is the best practice. It can feel heavy and oily if used too close to my roots. It does make my hair feel very soft and silky though I can't say it seems to totally control frizziness. Tones it down sure and I really liked how soft my hair felt after using it but I couldn't go so far as to say it totally gets rid of frizz.But one thing that seriously bothers me about this product is the scent. It's just too overpowering. One night I made the mistake of putting it into my hair after a late-night pick-me-up shower and I couldn't even sleep because the stench of perfume was so overpowering. I don't know what I was thinking. Even during the day it is very distracting. I don't think I'll be able to continue using it after this review's done. I can definitely see the scent being a real issue for people who are sensitive or allergic to perfumes. I'd definitely recommend a wrist patch test before anybody uses this in earnest--that's how bad it is!If not for the scent this would be a -star product. It'll be a fine day when L'Oreal figures out that they use too much perfume in their products. Catwalk's Curls Rock does just as good of a job of controlling frizz and making hair soft after showering and it smells worlds better. Works all right but WOW it smells strong.,Neutral
I have a fairly thick and wavy dark reddish/blonde/gray Irish style mop that can inflate like a balloon with any humidity.  However my hair is also fine so that means many serums are a bit too heavy for me no matter how little I use.  For reference over the years I've used the high to the low:  Redken Smooth Down Morrocanoil Suave Garnier and Hask.  They're all good products but often enough my hair looks dirty and limp only one day after shampooing.  If you have dry hair - mine is very dry - shampooing more than three times a week isn't warranted and strips your hair.The good news is this stuff has no cones!  No silicones in this formula (usually listed as dimethicone or dimethylconol ) and that is probably ingredient number one in -% of serums out there.  And make no mistake about it silicones will weigh your hair down.  (The other issue with silicones is they build up in your hair necessitating the use of a clarifying shampoo at least once weekly.)  The ingredients in L'Oreal Eversleek Super Intense Serum include: castor oil olive fruit oil sunflower oil and argan oils.  However considering all the fruit oils this does not have any oily feel whatsoever.  In fact on day two after shampooing my hair did feel and look a lot cleaner than after using above mentioned silicone based serums.  It does a fine job of smoothing your hair but not so sure about boosting shine.People have complained about fragrance but I've found it to be very light and quite delightful.  In fact it smells expensive and like a good perfume but nowhere near as heavy.  The consistency as others have remarked is a bit watery and definitely not the heavy oil slick that most serums are.  However the dispenser spits out maybe two times more than I would customarily use (and I have long hair).Upon final reflection this serum would be great for those with fine and/or blonde hair and not so much for the more coarser haired brunettes out there. Tame Your Frizz Fest,Neutral
High quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily. It has a very pleasant flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower. You only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower. So even though the product is expensive you will get a lot of use out of it. It seems that the cheaper dollar a bottle kind I sometimes use only lasts a week or  because I have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower.I would say the smell lasts for around  hours or so so it's almost like perfume. My sister-in-law asked me yesterday You always smell so good. What do you wear? I wasn't wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before I had done my morning routine and I had to run something over there to her. I told her that it must just be the body wash. If you have ever used Dove shampoo or conditioners it is almost the same smell.I am looking forward to trying the cucumber/green tea kind when I run out of these  bottles. I would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life: aunt mother girlfriend wife. I know many women who would never buy this Dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest. I intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them.I also use this as bubble bath when I take a nice hot bath. Excellent product. A+ from me. Thick body wash that lathers easily--sometimes I use it for bubble bath (Deep Moisture),Neutral
I think this is great value for the price. It's a thick milky body wash that lathers nicely and has a mild scent neutral enough to be used by myself and my boyfriend without interfering with perfume or cologne. It lasts because it's a big bottle and you only eed about a dime size amount.  I wouldn't say it eliminates the need for lotion or oil but it does leave the skin moist refreshed and not feeling stripped like other washes or liquid soaps. Would definitely buy again. Nice and moisturizing and great value,Neutral
I use this product on both my son and I.  I've used on my son since birth.  The baby soaps dried out his skin so his pediatrician recommend Dove.  We'll never use anything else. I get really dry legs and I still have to lotion but they are no where near as dry since I've started using this product.  It gets an A+ in our house!  Doesn't have all the harsh chemicals  or dyes and perfumes that other soaps have. Perfect for dry skin!,dry skin
Dove soap is great for sensitive skin.  I use it for my face and also in the shower.  Just a great product.  The Dove soaps that have fragrance are also very nice but I have problems using any kind of soap with a perfume smell so this is perfect.When my son was a baby he had skin sensitivity to soap and his doctor told me to use this one.  I have used it for all of us ever since. Best Soap Ever,great product
My husband has sensitive skin.  If he uses a soap with too much fragrance he gets a slight rash  on his chest after about two times using it - even the &#;natural&#; scented soaps.  I can tolerate more scent them him but I also get a slight rash after prolonged use with a scented soap.  This is the only soap we've found that does not give us a rash so it is always in the shower.  I also like that it doesn't leave a scent on your skin so if I choose to wear a perfume it doesn't clash.It's also a good soap to keep in the guest bath because both men & women can use it without being offended by a scent that is either masculine or feminine. Favorite Everyday Soap,Neutral
[Good]The scent is really great. It's a mix of soap and charcoal. It's very subtle for me. I really like it compared to the cheap perfume or cologne smell of most regular soaps.For normal dry skin this isn't bad.The price is pretty good.[Bad]As other reviewers have already noted this isn't for people with actual sensitive skin due to the ingredients. While better than normal soap the ingredients are still pretty harsh. If you want something better be prepared to spend more money.In my case while this soap does not do anything bad to my dry it doesn't do anything good for it either.[Verdict]Try it out. If you really do have problems with your skin you're probably going to need to buy specialized soap. It's alright,dry skin
Really this is one of the best &#;commodity&#; soaps if you ask me.  Leaves my skin clear doesn't dry my skin out it's residue free and I come out of the shower squeaky clean.  Leaves me with a nice clean smell not the smell of a weird cheap perfume that I get from some cheaper scented soaps.Lever fits the bill very well.  Might not have the same exotic scents that the more expensive brands have but it'll sure do the job that it is intended for - to clean you up!Unless there is a sale at your local retail store (walmart safeway etc) you can be fine with buying on amazon but in my case the price was not better.  In fact I bought from amazon and the same day went to safeway only to find the same soap on sale for cheaper!  Oh well only a few bucks.  If it wasn't for the sale prices would have been near identical. Great soap but price may be better in retail stores,dry skin
After reading positive reviews I wanted to like this product but I wasn't impressed. I won't be getting this again.The cons: This product is really drying to my hair and leaves it in tangles. I have to use a super softening conditioner to try to counteract this. It also has a sickenly sweet smell I'd equate to old women's perfume. I didn't expect it to lather and it doesn't. Lastly one day after washing my hair is lying flat.The pros: It makes my hair extra shiny and it doesn't have as many nasty chemicals as other products. Not impressed: Dried out my hair,Neutral
This product is very good.  Very gentle without a lot of perfume.  I think that the disks could be smaller w/more of them.  I cut them in half. Nice product,Neutral
After two weeks of using these disks I found that my skin really improved.  I finished off with another ROC product and together they gave me a really nice moist finished results.  My pores appeared smaller and I'm very pleased with it.  I only reserved the one star because it's heavily perfumed and I wish it weren't. This works!,Neutral
I can't really say how much I like or dislike this product; that's because I rarely use it since I cannot handle the smell.  It is like washing your face with foamy perfume.  YUCK! PERFUMEY STINK,Neutral
It lathers well and makes my hair feel very clean.  I have color treated and damaged hair that I would like to grow out ASAP. With SLES in most shampoos acting as a hair-growth retardant I had to make sure to get something healthy.  I generally always use healthier stuff anyway.  No Parabens or phthalates and I try to avoid sulfates.I feel like this leaves my hair in fine shape.  I follow up with Kiss My Face Miss Treated conditioner.This smells slightly medicinal but not in a bad way.  But it doesn't have a perfumey smell at all.  I am definitely a fan. Love It,Neutral
Orange Ginger body wash has a mild pleasant scent that reminds me of a high end spa.  The fragrance lasts nicely if you combine it with the body lotion but you can use perfume without creating a weird smell.It keeps skin nicely hydrated with a little glow and it's not greasy. Really good everyday body wash,Neutral
I bought this travel spray as a gift but this was a recommendation from a friend who says it works great and is just perfect for travel. It is nice to have something like this to put your favorite perfume in for a vacation instead of halling the entire bottle with especially with all of the new TSA regulations. Great product! travel spray,great product
My perfume is bulky and heavy. While I can still manage to fit it in a bigger purse there's no way I'm going to shove it in a little crossbody purse! This product is seriously so useful and compact! It is super easy to pump any perfume into this atomizer. I had no problems with it leaking or spraying incorrectly. It is literally a miniature on-the-go perfume bottle! I absolutely love this thing. I purchased an atomizer from the Sephora brand and I returned it the next day because the process of putting the perfume into the atomizer seemed way too messy and complicated than it should have been. The Travalo is literally just a little pump... so simple and easy! Btw the actual bottle isn't this dark ugly pink but a lighter pretty pink :-) if you wear perfume then you need this product!,Neutral
My husband bought me a bottle of this on Amazon. The price was great but there's nothing special about the smell. It's a faint scent of something but not sure of what. Maybe baby fresh powder scent but you can get that with  LOVES BABY SOFT Anyway's I sprayed on alot because it was hard to smell and it faded within in a couple of hours. I guess she's like all the other stars and just has to have a perfume scent that is'nt worth buying. Scent does'nt last!,Neutral
The Amazon warning says this toy is a marble.  It is neither a toy nor a marble.  It is indeed the same soap you know and love.  You probably still shouldn't stick it in your mouth or roll it on the ground just in case.  But my . year old can handle it without choking so I think the warning might take it just a bit far.Same Dial smell for  year but yes &#;new and improved&#; bar shape.  It's a fresh smell it does contain perfume.  It smells like a lot of other &#;fresh linen&#; type smells.  Clean airy but not floral or musky.  I find people either love it or hate it.  I grew up with it so I love it and I'm the wife so my husband loves it too.  My  year old doesn't like it and won't use it.  So don't buy the big pack if you're not sure or if you're the husband test out - bars first before you buy .  In my opinion the bent bar has actually saved my soap and my shower.  My bars are flat on top upwardly-rounded on the bottom like an arch.  The arch helps your bar dry quicker and doesn't leave as much oozy ooey gooey soap on the dish.  I don't hate it.To use: lather well in hands or on a cloth poof loofah or brush and rub scrub lather or repeat on your body.  For best results rub where you smell the worst don't put it in your eyes ears or mouth unless you've been swearing a lot or talking back to your mother (maybe that's why my  year old doesn't like it...).Value:  pretty good without clipping coupons.  Better with subscription or coupons.Tip:  To save your soap when it gets thin pull out a new bar.  Use them both in one shower session.  Yes you will be really clean.  Split up the body areas between the bars if you're really looking to save some cash.  Then smoosh the little bar on top of the big bar.  They'll dry together and you'll have a bulky new bar for tomorrow (or tonight if you're into that kind of thing).  This trick also does not work on marbles but I think we discussed that earlier. Decent Value tips to save your soap and a warning about the warning...,Neutral
It's a shame it's being discontinued this fruity floral musk and patchouli scent smells heavenly on my skin and even my perfume loathing husband loves it.As tasteless as many people find the bottle I find it charming all ruffles and frills in it's little plastic dome and I love how it looks on my dressing table.Admittedly I'm also one of those people who likes leopard miniskirts and wears a pushup bra to the grocery store. Too Too Good To Last,Neutral
I love this perfume. Too bad I heard that it was not going to be made anymore. Trying to stock up now. The price on this was terrific. I've seen where the price is hiked up because it will be hard to get a hold of in the future. The only downfall I have it with the tutu on the bottle. You have to pull it down every time you spray or it gets in the way. Great scent! Beautiful bottle!,Neutral
I must be honest in saying this perfume was bought for the bottle.  I have been an admirer of most things Betsey Johnson for years.  I love the shape of the bottle the uniqueness of the design and wanted it on my dresser and if the perfume smelled good that would be a bonus.  If I base my review solely on the bottle it would be  out of five stars.  The bustier top is plastic but made to look like frosted glass.  From far it looks glass but upon closer inspection clearly it isn't.  The dome is a cute idea for the packaging but in a barbie/matel pretend makeup sort of way.  I would have hated to buy it retail knowing that the topper isn't glass.  I would have loved the bottle much more if it was. I do however feel it's worth what I paid and I am over all happy with the look minus all the plastic.Now for the scent of the perfume.  I'd like to start off by saying as most know scent is one of those things that can be different for everyone.  This perfume may smell wonderful to or on one person but be the most horrible scent for another. This is my experience;I personally can't say I care for TooToo nor do I hate it.  I just don't like it for me.  Upon the first whiff It brought me back directly to my childhood.  The scent smells very much like the candy the old ladies at my grandmothers church used to eat all the time called violets.C. Howard Violet Candies .-Ounce Boxes (Pack of )The candy taste like it smells and it smells like strong perfume.  The perfume smells like the candy.  It was so strong with one spritz that it gave me a headache almost instantly.  The little I put on my wrist was promptly washed off with dish washing soap to get rid of it.  However the perfume is so strong the scent still lingered on my skin after being washed but it was much more tolerable.  Diluted it's not a bad smell at all but for me it's just way to strong.  So in it's bottle it shall stay.  I'd say  out of five on the scent alone not the worst smelling perfume but too strong for me. Bought for the bottle.,Neutral
I hesitated about buying this perfume online because I'm always paranoid that the perfumes are counterfeit. I am happy to report this is the real deal! Believe me I wanted to purchase this perfume for approximately  months before taking the plunge (given that I have an excess of perfumes). I became familiar with the perfume because I would spray it on every occasion I could (i.e. during visits to the mall and other perfumeries)... long story short the perfume I received is % real.It's a very sweet scent...like candy... but not too heavy or overwhelming. i love this scent and I always receive compliments while wearing it. I will say some days I feel like it wears off quickly but as the day progresses someone will compliment me and ensure me that the sent is there :]I really would recommend this fragrance to those who love sweet smells. I will say it's a sophisticated sweet. Hope this helped! Prada Candy- Love it!,Neutral
I can't get enough of this scent. This is my forth bottle and I love it. Smells very nice and I get tons of compliments. Shipping was super quick! Love this perfume!,Neutral
I know it's Prada but the name is not enough to sell me on this perfume. I don't think this scent at all lives up to expectation. It smells like a blend of Bath & Body Works fruity lotion and Love's Baby Soft. If that's your thing I say go for it. If not you are probably like me and expected a heck of a lot more from Prada. Dislike,Neutral
Just as it's name implies Prada Candy is a VERY sweet perfume. I love sweet perfumes so this was a hit with me. The only thing I did not like about this perfume is the bottle nozzle. It seems to squirt the perfume out at you and doesn't mist/spray like other perfumes. This can be quite annoying. Not sure if it's just mine that is kind of flawed...haha. Either way I find a way to rub this lovely sent on myself. It's a great price and I was pleasantly pleased with this purchase. I would buy this again. =) So Sweet.,Neutral
I ordered this product for my wife on Christmas. It is a little pricey but she absolutley loves this fragerance. Being a man I must admit many womens perfumes smell bad to me but this one smelled very nice Nice,Neutral
I got this cleanser because I am addicted to face care products. My husband says I have too many skin care products but I dont care. I have super sensitive skin and my senses are sensitive so i cant use high perfume products. I have tried many diffrent brands of skin care products biore neutrogena simple garnier...most of them were ok but i think they were targeted towards young skin and some of them were just way to strong/perfumy. I am  and i need to start using big girl products. This cleanser is very nice and gentle. I love it. happy face,sensitive skin
This isn't a facial scrub or oil removing formula. It is very smooth and slightly oily in feel when applied to the face. It has a chalky scent almost a clay smell. I usually don't like these types of cleansers because I have oily skin and these don't usually leave my face feeling cleaner. However this is an anti-aging formula and I can understand why it is a non-drying formula. I have been using it for a little while now and have grown to like it. There are no overpowering perfumes it is easy to rinse off and it does cleanse well after all. It also leaves my skin still moist and I think that is actually helping my T-Zone of oily skin and I'm not getting any younger either. Cleans Well Soft Smooth Feel,Neutral
This facial cleanser is notable partly for what it is not:  not greasy not drying not perfumed not overpriced.  Unlike many milky or cream cleansers it rinses off effectively with water yet unlike most water-rinse cleansers it is very gentle to my dry skin.  I use it mostly in the morning but when I tried it at night to remove makeup it was effective.  I don't wear much makeup and I use a separate eye makeup remover for mascara.It has no anti-aging or exfoliating properties that I can detect.  That is okay with me but I think the manufacturer could build more customer trust without making those claims.  My skin is super-sensitive to chemical exfoliation (acids vs. scrubs) and this product causes zero irritation or peeling for me.  It contains glycolic acid but the cleanser is not meant to stay on skin for any length of time. A separate treatment product is probably the way to go if that is important to you.The flip-top lid and the stand-on-the-lid design are great for storage and for those half-asleep early morning showers. Given the size of the container and the small amount needed for each use this cleanser is a pretty good value.Having outlined the good points of this cleanser I have to say that I would not buy it.  Non-alcohol toners are equally effective for me and more pleasant to use.  I don't like the scent of this product.  It does not contain added fragrance but it does have a scent and that scent does not smell clean to me.  That's a personal preference though and for many people this cleanser might be just right. Gentle and non-drying,dry skin
I have always had issues with my skin. Whether it's the occasional break-out or dryness it's been a challenge finding the right moisturizer. I absolutely LOVE Own. The night cream has a generic smell not offensive but not like perfume. I am okay with that. The results are superior. I have been using the product for a month and have noticed some significant results. The crow's feet by my eyes have diminished. The wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable. Most importantly my chin has totally cleared up. No more pimples. I think my skin looks the best it has in a long time. As an added bonus my skin is super soft. I also use the day cream and the nighttime lip therapy moisture. I highly recommend those as well. As for the cost it is less expensive compared to department store products. I am a firm believer in this product line. Love it!! Beautiful skin!,Neutral
Own Products Refining Moisture Night Cream is a good facial moisterizer. I've used many and this brand is high quality. However for the price (approx $ via Amazon Prime) I believe . ounces is a small amount. If the OWN company wants to sell more I suggest cutting their price to at least $. So many of their competitors' products have a disgusting perfume smell and do not work as effectively. Other than the price I highly recommend this product. Good Facial Moisterizer,Neutral
This product's promo states that it is fragrance-free yet there it is in the ingredient list: parfum. French for perfume. What's a poor body that's allergic to perfume to do? It is estimated that a quarter of the population has sensitivity if not outright allergy to scented products. That might seem like a lot but that's because so many people simply don't know what is causing their itching burning sneezing watering eyes headache etc.The product does seem to have an excellent consistency but of course I can't test it on my allergic face because it would probably cause puffy ugly bright red skin that would cause me to hide in the house for days - it looks that horrible.And then there's the deceptive packaging. I am not impressed. What part of unscented don't they understand?,Neutral
This is my first wig so I didn't really know what to expect. For the price I was wowed and most people dont realize its a wig. The only reason I didn't give it a th star is because the inside cap is SO big theres enough room for a full head of long hair inside. I have almost no hair at all so the cap sags in the back and causes a strange shape but I cover that and no one notices. I did have to trim it cause it was a little over the top for everyday wear and got tangled alot. All in all a good wig as far as I know and I'm glad I made all my first timer mistakes on a cheap wig. I may order another and experiment with length and adjustments with this one thats the nice thing about this wig. It's not expensive so if you mess it up you just order another. Also the strange smell that other reviewers mentioned...It smells like new clothes of a new car a little like plastic and factory. But it QUICKLY looses that smell and is replace with your smell(your perfume/soap/lotion and whatever). I love it and wear it alot but its a bit big.,Neutral
This serum has the strongest perfume odor of any product I've put on my face.  I made the mistake of getting it too close to my eyes and they were irritated and teared for a couple of hours afterwards.Of the ingredients (listed below) only the first two have been shown to be good non-irritating plant products for your skin.  Some of the oils are known irritants.I recommendOlay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum Fragrance Free .-Fluid Ouncesas a better option.Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil Rosa Moschata Seed Oil Portulaca Pilosa Extract Sucrose Cocoate Palmitoyl Tripeptide- Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil Alaria Esculenta Extract Cananga Odorata Flower Oil Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil Eugenia Caryophylus (Clove) Flower Oil Pelargonium Graveolens Oil Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil Rose Flower Oil Geranium Maculatum Oil Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil Murraya Koenigii Leaf Oil Cinnamomum Zeylanicum (Cinnamon) Leaf Oil Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Citronellol Eugenol Limonene Geraniol Linalool Benzyl Benzoate Benzyl Salicylate Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate Sorbitan Isostearate Expensive - Smell Too Strong - Better Products Available,Neutral
Though this isn't the best price per ounce at under $ it's a small price to pay for a substantial amount of sampling. Afterwards should you decide to purchase a full-sized bottle it's nice to put some from the large container into this small one. That way it takes up less room in your bathroom drawer travel bag or makeup pouch. Despite being slim and fairly fit I'll be turning  soon and for the past few years have noticed the gradual appearance of frustrating tree rings on my long slender neck with one actually beginning to droop some. This cream actually seems to tighten that skin a bit. The lines are still there but at least regular use gives it a more taut appearance which is better than doing nothing about it. I've always had oily skin that has made me picky about what I can wear since many lotions and creams tend to make my skin feel smothered greasy or dirty but this cream is light enough that it doesn't bother me much especially considering the result. It doesn't have a sweet appealing fragrance but it doesn't have a strong chemically odor either so I don't mind the rather neutral smell. Besides I usually spray on perfume or body mist after moisturizing anyway. I get migraines but this doesn't smell strong enough to cause them so that's great. Before finishing this sample size I purchased a larger container to continue using it on a daily basis. I've found that using it two to three times a day renders the best result. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have a cumulative effect. In other words when I don't use it the lines and drooping are back as though they never went away just FYI. :s  Still I use it more routinely to maintain the smoothing effect. There are many other products out there that claim to tighten the neck so many it's overwhelming. I decided to try this one because of the availability of this sampler better than the single- or double-use packets; because of familiarity with the name and StriVectin results on stretch marks and scars; and finally because even in full-sized tubs it's more affordable than others I've never even sampled to know if they're worth it. I'd love to know of better more effective products so please let me know about them by replying to this review. Thank you and hope this helps. A Great Sample Size,Neutral
All berries smell similar when used in perfumes but WONDERSTRUCK has slightly more distinctive notes of raspberry and blackberry. After the berries the peach is the next strongest fruit - which surprised me as it's meant to be a base note yet it develops soon after being applied to skin. The soft vanilla is present through all of the fragrance with adds a creamy sweetness and warmth to the mix.WONDERSTUCK is meant to contain thirteen different floral notes but - aside from a breeze of freesia - none of them are strong enough to stand out from the fruits and vanilla. This is  definitely a fruity perfume.There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base thanks to the constant trickle of raspberry peach and vanilla. The sandalwood and musk are mingled closely together so it is a warm and creamy mix - nice but it is a blend that is used in many fragrances today.Scent notes: Raspberry dewberry green tea freesia apple blossom vanilla honeysuckle white hibiscus amber musk and sandalwood.***Although I think WONDERSTRUCK is 'nice' very wearable and wears quite well I won't be replacing my bottle.  As whilst it is pleasant to wear it's nothing new and it doesn't excite me. Lots of people compare this to Britney Spears Fantasy [another EA release] but I don't get the comparison at all. I'd say this is more along the lines of a Harajuku Lovers release; Music. Not struck by wonder...,Neutral
Really nice with a bit of spicy.  Not overpowering.  Not weak.  Out of  perfume samples I got this one was one of the top .  I liked it quite a bit.  Not bad at all. Pretty darn nice for a spicy scent I like it,Neutral
This perfume has several scents mixed in and I notice them throughout the day. This is the type of mellow perfume that you can wear all day every day and be happy with it. I put this on in a store and kept sniffing my wrist all through the mall- then had to go back and buy some. It's definitely worth replacing my bottle when the time comes! Makes me want to smell myself all day!,Neutral
I love this perfume. Every time I wear it I feel like a fairy. The flower &#;perfume&#; smell is amazing! Beatiful!,Neutral
I sprayed this on me today left it on my wrist for about  min to an hour for it to set in before I judged the scent. Now I can't stop smelling my wrist. This stuff is amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect with Taylor Swift BUT I am so so happy with this perfume. To me it's classy (anyone could wear this older younger whatever) light slightly musky mixed with vanilla-y notes. (I never read the actual notes because I don't really understand it... but that is my version of what it smells like. lol) It first reminded me of Fantasy by Britney Spears but it seems like a lighter smelling version of that. I find that sometimes Fantasy can be overpowering although I really do love that one as well! This is a bit pricey which is unfortunate but it's worth the price if you can afford it. Really love it.,Neutral
I honestly am not a fan of Taylor Swift...Like most above- year olds I find her to be quite immature/irritating...That being said I got a sample of this perfume from Sephora many months ago and I really loved it...But I just couldn't bear the thought of forking over my hard earned money to a celebrity for their perfume....I sort of forgot about the sample and it sat in my drawer. I recently started smelling it again and JUST HAD to buy it....I'm justifying this by thinking about how Taylor Swift gives a lot of money to charity so my dollars are sort of going there! LOL. Anyway....SO NOW TO THE SCENT...It is very sweet and gourmand for sure....There is a strong raspberry smell but it's  not a gross  dollar body spray type of smell...It smells so classy not candy syrupy sweet...The other strongest smell is vanilla to me...At the end of the day the perfume smells quite woodsy and sweet...this perfume does not last well on skin for me at least. I usually spray my clothes with it and like that I can definitely smell it the whole day sometimes even the next day when I spray it on my coat or scarf....Overall though lasting power isn't too great. BUT IT SMELLS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOD. Not a fan of Taylor But the Perfume is AMAZING!!,Neutral
I'll admit it. I mostly bought this fragrance because I &lt; Taylor. (Her music is refreshing and heartfelt and she has an adorable personality) It arrived today and WOW I think I found my new favorite perfume! It reminds me of a spicy sweet floral with subtle fruity undertones. It's yummy but not gourmand. And it's timeless. I for one am Wonderstruck ;)As as side point the bottle is also GORGEOUS! It's a beautiful shimmering iridescent that changes between purple green and gold depending on the angle. The charms are too cute. It looks fabulous on my dresser and the elegantly mysterious yet fun and flirty fragrance makes me happy. I can't stop sniffing my wrists! Thanks Taylor! Rock on. Dancing round all alone,favorite perfume
I generally do not buy celebrity perfumes because they always seem to smell really cheap. This perfume is actually a very mature blend between flowery and sweet (not an overpowering amount of sweet). It's a very complex scent that clearly had a lot of thought put into it. It's subtle enough to smell just when you're hugging the person wearing it and I get compliments all the time. Side note- very sturdy bottle: I dropped it from about five feet onto a tile floor today and all that happened is the sprayer popped off- it popped right back on and works again! This has become my daily go-to. Just do it it's fantastic. Fantastic!,Neutral
I just received this perfume as a gift (it was on my Amazon wishlist) and I really love it.  It first came to my attention because I'm a Taylor Swift fan and the description of the scent sounded very nice.  It's a very nice combination floral and vanilla and it has good lasting power.  I definitely recommend this! Wonderful Wonderstruck,Neutral
Not only is Wonderstruck one of those generic overly sweet/candy-like perfumes it smells like glitter too. The bottle is pretty though (that's what the  star is for). Smells like glitter,Neutral
I am  years old and very picky about the perfume I wear. This scent is gorgeous. Very sparkly and beautiful. Lasts all day. I can detect the scent still on my skin hours after I apply it. Wearing this fragrance is a great mood booster. I instantly feel happy when I wear it. Sometimes I put it on for no reason at all.  But then again a lady needs no reason at all to feel beautiful or smell pretty : )The &#;Basenotes&#; perfume website lists the fragrance notes as:Top NotesRaspberry Dewberry Green tea Freesia Apple blossomMiddle NotesVanilla Honeysuckle White hibiscusBase NotesAmber Musk Sandalwood PeachI have never purchased a &#;celebrity fragrance&#; before - this truly surprised me.

I've used John Frieda products for years.  I always find that they are a good product for the price.  I was looking forward to adding a little depth to my hair which has recently begun to thin.  This shampoo Full repair does do the trick.  My hair is fuller after every wash.  It's got bounce and shine.  My hair looks especially nice after styling. However I'm not as sold on the conditioner which seems to leave my hair drier.  So I've been pairing this shampoo with a more moisturizing and heavier conditioner.Be aware that the fragrance is strong so much so that my husband won't use (he feels like he's wearing perfume).  It doesn't bother me. Adds Body,Neutral

My parents just got back from Europe. Before my Mom left she asked me what I would like from Europe. I said a good perfume and some good dark chocolate. Then she asked what kind of scents I like. I said a fresh clean floral. Now mind you my Mom does NOT wear perfume so I knew I was taking a risk in having her sniff one out. She brought back Cartier Baiser Vole Parfum and Body Lotion. I nervously took my first sniff and was under its spell. Then I got my husbands enthused approval on the fragrance as well. She did a great job picking a perfume for me...it is fresh gorgeous floral and unique. The bottle is perfectly shaped and elegant. She also brought me some European dark chocolate. Perfect gifts. I think this fragrance is perfect for any woman age  and up. It's sophisticated and crisp... not stuffy. Thanks Mom,Neutral
I love this perfume and have been complimented so many times when I wear it. It is a long lasting feminine pretty scent especially when layered with the body lotion. Just lovely,Neutral
Best Perfume Ever!  Love this perfume.  My husband loved the way I smelled after using this perfume!  It last a long time after you apply it also.  This is now my new signature perfume I will be wearing everyday!  It has a very soft flower smell to it but seems modern not like other floral perfumes that I have worn before. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  Best Perfume Ever!,long time
This is a very classic smell.  It smells of elegance and wealth.  It does not have a sweet smell but it is very pleasing.  It lasts all day and both men and women compliment me when I wear it.  This was an amazing price for an authentic Cartier perfume! I will purchase again. Classi,Neutral
Let me start by saying I have oily acne-prone blotchy and fair skin. Although it's not *terrible* it's also not great. Most foundations I find are either a weird color don't cover anything or come off halfway through the day. This stuff is none of that! It covers just the right amount- my blotches are evened out and the few pimples I get are hidden. It blends nicely and evenly. I use a foundation brush but I've read sponges are good too. You also don't need a lot for good coverage. For being a heavier foundation it actually feels light on the skin. The trick to make it last is to set it with a powder. Graftobian has their own powder but I'm cheap so I use the ELF HD coverage powder. I'm sure it works just as well.The con is that it smells like old lady makeup. You know that smell- moth balls and weird perfume. If you are easily offended by smells be wary. It also can transfer to other surfaces easily if you don't set it with a powder. Finally a great foundation!,Neutral
I'm a St. Ives fan in general but I especially like this lotion. It has a silky feel going on and it feels almost powdery when it dries. There is a smell but it's pretty natural (more like baked goods than perfume). I really don't have any complaints and definitely no hesitation in recommending it! Good stuff!,Neutral
I've been using St. Ives lotions for about  years and I have no complaints. The price is right and it really works; I'm always left feeling hydrated after I use it. I happen to love the Deep Restring the best because it really moisturizes and doesn't contain any perfume smells which I can't stand. It's good stuff. Years of Good Stuff,Neutral
I've been using this lotion for years but since the most recent label/bottle change I've only been able to find it on Amazon but for a really good price. This lotion initially feels heavy but spreads around easily and feels light on your skin. It absorbs quickly so you can get dressed soon after putting it on without having to worry about having trouble getting your jeans on.I noticed in another review there was a complaint about it having a scent. It is fragrance-free (meaning no perfumes added) but does have a light scent which I've always liked. You can't expect something to have no scent whatsoever! Compared to other frangrance-free lotions this smells loads better.It keeps my skin soft and smooth all day long and into the next and it has never irritated my sensitive skin. I recommend this lotion to pretty much everyone! This is the BEST lotion!,sensitive skin
I first used the Curl Cream which is a VERY GOOD product with IMPRESSIVE results  but when I tried the Curl Sealer I was TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY  This product did what I thought Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie PROMISED to do  but FAILED! This product takes a while to dry but I like the wet look effect it gives before it dries. When it does dry my  OCEAN waves be SHINNING like STARS!Even though Curl Sealer does not hold your hair like a brick it still withstands the worst humidity and keeps my hair in place.  The humidity on the East Coast has been BRUTAL the last couple of days but this sealer has kept my hair on point  through it all!I have the WORST hard to hold  combination hair.....EVER! curly wavy coarse  nappy & straight Seems like the more I use this the wavier and CONTROLED my wave pattern becomes! My history with waves go waaaay back to the old Ultra Wave lye process days!  I have  used every wave  product on the market Murray's Full of Waves Sportn' Waves  Waves............etc ( all of these products mentioned are full of petroleum lanolin & perfume) Waajid Curl Sealer is the HOLY GRAIL my hair has been praying for! Alllllll of THAAAAAAT!,Neutral
I have very fair Caucasian skin with slight yellow undertones and unfortunately this didn't match me.  I needed to apply multiple layers to get the coverage I wanted leading to a grey cast despite thoroughly patting it into my skin and allowing oxidation time.  So even though it didn't work for my face I will still use it up on other areas that need a bit of SPF - it surprisingly matches my forearms very well!  I do like that the product has no added fragrance since I am sensitive to many perfumes.  The texture dries to a semi-matte but unfortunately does not take setting powder very well and tends to make clumps on my makeup brushes even when just patting the powder on.  I like the look of the dispenser bottle but it can get a bit messy and isn't completely practical.In the end the best thing I've found is Revlon Colorstay cream foundation.  That line does not contain SPF so a separate one must be used prior to application but the coverage is very good and does not have the problems listed above.It was worth a try just didn't work for me. Didn't work for me still a decent product,Neutral
lovely color enhancer.. a mellow brown for me I am EXTREMELY PALE..  i turn orange with almost alllll lotions with any kind of color bronzer enhancer etc.  so if youre already super dark IDK how youd like it.  BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS.. You will smell amazing for the rest of the day.  it smells like an amazing perfume not tanning lotion at all.  At the salon it costs like $..  and $ for a ml sample.  so I would say definitely a good buy.  Also... i dry out major!  esp in the winter (now)  and this lotion has actually helped my skin from drying out as much as it normally does after tanning.  I still need to apply something though within a couple hours...  but it def is an improvement. loves love notes,Neutral
I am a perfume fanatic and this is a perfume you MUST buy!  The dealer is authentic and I love the way this perfume smells! Amazing!,Neutral
Shalimar Initial in my opinion smells completely unique from Shalimar. Personally I do not care for the scent of Shalimar at all. Shalimar Initial attracted my eye because of the beautiful bottle and pink color of the liquid. It looked very soft mysterious flirtatious and old-fashioned in a classic way. The fragrance matched the bottle to my delight! Shalimar Intitial is a light warm fragrance which clusters to the body as you go about your day. I find several squirts last me for hours...at least - hours. And yes I can apply this liberally without overwhelming any passersby. As I mentioned before this is a light soft fragrance that has a gentleness as it's characteristic as well as refinement. In my imagination I see a young Victorian woman Gibson girl-like with a rich oak vanity. Atop the vanity is an ornate crystal bottle containing this fragrance of which she applies to her neck and hair each day. She's a young woman with a busy life and yet the pace of her life is much slower than we know in modern times. She walks a little slower to admire the flowers as she takes her morning walks in the countryside. She accepts the sensation of cool raindrops on her cheek and delights in watching the flames flicker in the fireplace as she sips her cup of tea. This perfume reminds of a time where things were simpler yet no less exciting and when the moments of life were savored. This fragrance smells very old to me and yet young all at once. Beautiful Unique Fragrance,Neutral
I didn't notice the name of the perfume. Shalimar has been my signature perfume most of my life. This is NOT that Shalimar look at the title &#;Shalimar INITIAL&#; it looks the same is packaged the same but it is NOT the same it is awful. Very expensive lesson for me. This scent is not a pleasant smelling perfume and is NOTHING like regular Shalimar. Even the free hand creme smelled so bad I threw it out. Has an unpleasant chemical smell. Don't order it is a waste of your money. An expensive lesson for me. Reordered the right one. Unfortunately wasted $ during the whole process. :) Not the Shalimar you love!!!,Neutral
I like automatic pumps and my only complaint about them would be that I manage to trigger the pump when I am cleaning my countertops a minor issue. Fun for teens to use. Great gift for a teen girl. Not so sure the scents would appeal to a teen boy as it includes a pink bottle of super fruit splash. Would not recommend for those sensitive to dyes and perfumes. Contains % salicylic acid. nice pump,Neutral
This fragrance has so many facets.  Sometimes you can smell it and sometimes you can't!  I love it to the point of having several bottles as well as soap lotion solid perfume and have become a collector of sorts.Agreed at times there is no trace of scent.  Other times the fragrance blooms after several hours.I understand there are issues with E Goddess having no scent being diluted with cooking oil etc.Just go with the flow myself.I have ordered it from the manufacturer and still its elusive scent prevails.Egyptian Musk in general is NOT as strong as it used to be sure.  The $ one oz from Body Time is not as strong as it used to be nor is Attar Bazaar.Guess there is the profit margin issue...street vendors have been adding corn and canola oil to E Musk for awhile.EG from Auric Blends is still affordable and a good product. Egyptian Goddess is...remarkable.,Neutral
I don't like strong perfume scents but I love the scent of Egyptian Goddess oil.  I get compliments on it all the time too and people always expect it to be a very expensive hard to find scent. Smells great without being overpowering,Neutral

i usually buy this from sasa.com it's like a dollar cheaper there but it was out of stock so i bought it here. $ + free shipping is a pretty good deal not to mention it only took  days to get to my house &lt;.notice: this is a Taiwanese brand. the directions are written in Taiwan...and if youve used sheet masks before it's not rocket science on how to use these. if you've never tried them you need to wash your face put the mask on and fit it to your face wait for skin to absorb serum and mask becomes dry (recommended - mins but about  mins for my skin to soak up all the goodies) and throw out when it dries. DO NOT RINSE YOUR FACE AFTERWARDS just rub remaining into your face. excess serum left in the packet i like to rub onto my neck.to my review. it's cool and refreshing on the skin and smells like pineapple. the mask is wide to fit most face shapes and has holes for your eyes nose and mouth. depending on the size of your eyes and mouth you may need to make the holes bigger so it fits more comfortably. make sure to put the side the plastic was on onto your face. this goes great with my shiseido white lucent line the products make my skin look soft and moisturized and i have a glow-y transparent look that lasts like - days til i use a new mask. i highly recommend using - masks a week or the day of a celebration maybe a wedding or if youre going to go out for the night. remember that all skin types are different so everyone will have different experiences.for those of you curious of the ingredients:Purified Water  -Butylene Glycol Glycerine Propylene Glycol Aloe Hyaluronic Acid Pineapple Alage Cucumber Lime Tree Triethanolamine Methyl Paraben Algae-Yeast Complex Bio-Active Silanols Lecithin Nanospheres Vegetale Collagen Citric Acid Royal Pearl Extract Tween- Ubiquinone Propyl Paraben Carbomer XanthanGum Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Hydroxide Perfume moisturizing and brightening :),Neutral
The Replenishing Rich Moisturizer by Simple is a vitamin enriched moisturizer without perfume or dyes designed for sensitive skin.  It is a good moisturizer.  My wife who uses a variety of moisturizers liked it.  It wasn't outstanding or anything that made her jump and yell wow this is the best stuff ever but then what moisturizer would ever make one do that.  She says it is good and she likes it.The three selling points on the box are the vital vitamin Pro-Vitamin B that helps restore soften and smooth the skin loving nutrients Glycern Bisabolol and Allantoin and that is has no perfume or dyes that could irritate your skin.  It did not irritate and worked as a good skin moisturizer.It is a fairly small bottle so you want to use this for face and neck and not your entire body or you would go through it pretty fast.  If you want a full body moisturizer you may want to get something that comes in a bigger bottle.  Overall a good product that my wife says worked fine. Good basic face and neck moisturizer,sensitive skin
The SIMPLE KIND TO SKIN REPLENISHING MOISTURIZER is all right but there's no SPF in it and I found that if you have excessively dry skin this won't do the trick.Even though I've got combo skin that borders on oily I use acne products that tend to dry out my skin occasionally and make it sensitive to sunburn so I must use a moisturizer and a sunscreen.When I used the SIMPLE MOISTURIZER I still had dry patches on my face even though I applied ample amounts of the lotion. This doesn't happen when I use a product likeOlay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion with UV Protection . -Fluid Ounce which is able to knock out any excess dryness and provide SPF protection (though it contains more chemicals).The plus side of SIMPLE MOISTURIZER is that it is fragrance-free and contains no dyes or other harsh chemicals that can irritate skin according to the package.The lotion's consistency is pretty fluid not too thick or thin and is easily applied to the face and absorbs quickly.I did find that my face looked shiny after a few hours but that's probably just my skin and the product didn't cause me to break out.Anyway I have to give it an OK rating. Although I like that it's formulated without perfumes and dyes I really wasn't blown away by this product. It didn't moisturize the dry patches on my face and it doesn't provide SPF. It's *OK* Unless Your Skin Is Really Dry!,dry skin
Overall I found this to be a good moisturizer.  As someone who has very sensitive dry skin including a number of skin conditions (my wife jokes that I'm a dermatologist's dream) I'm always cautious about new products.  For example I'm now allergic to most laundry detergents and deodorant products.  Anyway I was gratified to read that there are no perfumes or colors added to this product.I've found that the moisturizer works very well on my face - no dryness redness or peeling which distinguishes it from plenty of other moisturizers.  It also lasts well over  hours.  And certainly no allergic reaction which is great.  The moisturizer also soaks in well - I don't feel oily or greasy.My only significant complaint is the apparent lack of spf protection which I'd expect to be in a moisturizer for the face.  For the money though this is a good moisturizer and I'll keep using it. A nice moisturizer,dry skin
I have sensitive skin and have to be careful what I use on my skin especially my face. I'm always on the lookout for new facial products to use especially in the dead of winter when my skin is very dry. I was looking forward to trying Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. I was expecting a natural product. Upon its arrival I read the ingredient list. Many of the ingredients sounded anything but natural. It reads more like a science lab project. The box does state the product is dermatologist tested noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic. As I opened the bottle of moisturizer I thought it smelled pleasant and natural not perfumey. The lotion is very light too light. After reading the name of the product I was expecting something much thicker and richer. I have been wearing it every day since I received it but after a few hours my face feels dry and tight again. The lotion goes on smooth and lightly. I don't think it does a very good job replenishing or moisturizing. It did not upset my skin or irritate it in any way which was a plus. It just didn't do what it I expected a replenishing moisturizer to do. After a few hours my face felt like I had not put on any moisturizer at all. There are plenty of less expensive products in the drugstores that perform much better. I would have to say Simple falls flat for me! Simply Falls Flat,sensitive skin
There are plenty of lotions out there with perfume and other stuff I just don't want. What I do want is a moisturizer that works. I don't want my hands to be covered with lotion an hour after I used the stuff it has to actually soak in. This lotion fits the bill. It's hypoallergenic uses no perfumes or animal products soaks in well without leaving your hands greasy and moisturizes your skin.I've noticed reviews by people with very sensitive skin who said this lotion wasn't gentle enough. All I can say is I don't have overly sensitive skin probably average and I had no problems with it. I thought it did a good job. I guess this is one of those products where you'll just have to test it on your own to know for sure. Gentle lotion no weird smell hypoallergeni,sensitive skin
I tried this new cream after bath it made my skin feel really soft soaked in well and didn't sit on my skin like most creams do.  I would use it again.  It has no perfume smell which I don't like in a lotion. A good new skin care lotion,Neutral
I have been using this daily for almost a month and to be honest I haven't noticed any change in my skin.  In it's favor it has a light not perfumey (if that is a word) smell.  It goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy look or feel to my skin.  When I first apply it my skin feels smooth and I want to think that it will moisturize my skin.  But ... after all of this time my skin looks and feels the same as it did before.  I don't see or feel any difference.In it's favor I have very sensitive skin and this did not cause any redness or other problems.I am disappointed as I had read favorable reviews and had I hoped for more positive results. I Had Hoped For Better Results,sensitive skin
I appreciate what this product actually is...something that has no perfumes or dyes. (from their web-site--->NO PERFUME NO COLOURNO UNNECESSARY INGREDIENTS so it won't upset your skin Dermatologically Tested and Approved)Now mind you this is a product made in the UK and sold there so I have no way of knowing if our dermatologists would find the same claims.The first couple of times I used it it felt as if there was a tightening to my face like there may alcohol in it.  But I tried it again and found that it feels better the more you use it.  It is not as rich feeling or as creamy as some products I've used and it makes no claims to repair any damage you may have.  It claims to last twelve hours and I can't seem to prove that claim.I found this to be an adequate moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling good but not great.While doing a web-search for this product I did notice that it was made in the USA by Alberto Culver and it seems fairly expensive for a product  like this. NO PERFUME NO COLOUR NO UNNECESSARY INGREDIENTS-According to the product info,Neutral
When it comes to moisturizing lotions I tend to grab what's on the bathroom counter slather it on then run out the door.  Simple Kind to Skin Replenishing is different.  It's fairly thick but doesn't feel greasy and a little bit goes a long way.  Once on the face (this is where I use it) it spreads easily and after  weeks of using it I don't notice any clogging or breakouts anywhere.  It is unscented (a big plus for me) and I would imagine would be great for taking to the gym or to work especially if the weather is cold and windy.  A dime-sized dot of lotion on my hand covers most of my face and my skin feels great for the rest of the day; the -hour claim on the bottle is accurate in my experience as my skin doesn't dry out at all.  This is exactly what I want and need from a lotion and is much better than others I've tried particularly those that are too thin too thick full of mineral oil and are heavily perfumed.  Contains Vitamin B glycerin bisabolol allantoin among other ingredients. Feels great lasts all day.,little bit
I'm a bit finicky when it comes to moisturizers preferring that they be creamy rather than watery so I've come to trust a few brands such as Neutrogena Eucerin and perhaps Burt's Bees and C.O. Bigelow.  I'm happy to report that I can add Alberto Culver's Simple to the list of reliable selections.  Worked well on my somewhat-sensitive facial skin being neither too thick nor too thin during and after application.  Does not contain dyes or perfumes and uses glycerin allantoin and bisabolol along with pro-vitamin B if that helps.  Interestingly while the container mentions some of the ingredients it doesn't have the usual list so I couldn't say if water was the top ingredient or not. Also there's no SBF rating so I would assume there is no added UV protection.  I would buy this again. Quality product on par with Neutrogena and Eucerin skin creams,Neutral
Simple replenishing moisturizer contains no animal products. It is hypoallergenic and free of perfumes or other possible irritants. It is a facial moisturizer and does not contain sunscreens. While it claims to contain vitamins I understand this to be nonsense when it comes to topical applications. The number one ingredient in all effective moisturizers is water. This is an attractively package product made in the USA and does a fine job on my sensitive skin. Vegetarian Vegan Friendly Facial Moisturizer,sensitive skin
There are no perfumes dyes irritants or animal products in this bottle.The best part of this lotion is that it has absolutely no smell. It has a lightthin and nearly naked consistency and is so breathable on the skin it is a pleasure to use.It contains Pro-Vitamin B glycerin bisabolol (to sooth ) and allantoin to soften.I like the plain simple ingredients. I like the fair price and I love the absence of scent and it's consistency. It also really does a great job hydrating and softening the skin just an overall good product.

The Simple moisturizer arrived halfway into one of the driest Decembers on record. The cold dry weather proved too much for my wife's regular moisturizerL'Oreal Paris Youth Code so she gladly broke her brand loyalty. A week later my wife was ready to make the switch permanent.Usually when a beauty product says it is unscented you can still smell something when you use it my wife said. This moisturizer was really nice because it doesn't have any perfume.We researched Simple Kind To Skin Replenishing Rich Moisturizer and learned the company's origin was to help people with sensitive skin. The company first introduced perfume and color-free soap in ; cleanse tone and moisturizing products were added in .Simple lasted all day while my skin looked dry at the end of the day with L'Oreal my wife said. I first tried using the same amount I had used with L'Oreal but that was too much. Simple moisturizer sinks into the skin better; it isn't greasy but it left my skin moist to the touch.The product packaging states that the moisturizer is Dermatologist tested; Noncomedogenic; Hypoallergenic [and] Does not contain any perfume dyes or harsh irritants that can upset your skin.My wife is switching from L'Oreal to Simple. She told me Simple Kind To Skin Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is a better value and does a better job moisturizing her skin in winter weather.Rating: Five stars Simple lasted all day while my skin looked dry at the end of the day with L'Oreal,Neutral
I have sensitive skin and have to watch what I use.  When I saw Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer it had all the things my demotologist recommends I use.  It is noncomedogenic has no perfume and no dyes.  I have been using it for two weeks and my skin looks great.  It does a very good job of moisturizing.  I have had no adverse reaction.  I only use a small amount each time.  There is no greasy feel.  My skin feels soft and smooth.  All in all It is a very good product for anyone. Does what it Says,sensitive skin
My skin is dry and sensitive.  Most moisturizers I've tried before may be great before bed but not under makeup.  Or the smell turns me off no matter how nice it makes my skin feel.  Finally here is a moisturizer that is light creamy no dyes no perfumes no sting and is not greasy.  Add that I can put it on a few minutes before makeup and my makeup doesn't slide off my face and I have enough reasons to buy more. Definitely will buy more,Neutral
First off let me say that I usually don't worry about perfumes and dyes in my skin care products.  This one is very nice though - I like it very well for inexpensive simple moisturizer.  I love too that it has no animal products - that's really nice to know.I had a horrid cold while using this.  It was really soothing to my red nose and upper lip and the redness went away after a day and didn't come back.  I also noticed that it did a great job getting rid of the crepey look that I get under my eyes when I wear the mineral based makeups.  That's a problem for me and one of the ways I judge a moisturizer and this one did the job.  I didn't really feel much of a residue at all- it's lighter than most of the moisturizers I normally would use.I didn't experience any burning of my skin or my eyes.  I usually don't have much problem with my skin but my eyes often will tear up and cry with some skincare products - but they didn't with this one.I'm only going to give it a  though because I found I had to reapply it every - hours.  It could be more long lasting. I like it!,Neutral
I'm always on the hunt for a great moisturizer and was intrigued when I saw that Simple was targeted for sensitive skin doesn't use perfumes dyes or harsh irritants; and boasts natural goodness.Some of the benefits of Simple are that it's light fragrance free gentle and a little covers a lot! It will definitely moisturize your skin and keep your skin soft.However it should be noted that some of the ingredients are not natural. For example Simple contains Disodium EDTA which has become a topic of interest because of many pro-natural organizations claims that it causes toxicity in mammals. In defense of Simple it's been stated that products regulated by the FDA contain such low levels of disodium EDTA that it won't cause direct harm when used as directed. However if you're cautious about what you ingest and/or put on your skin Simple might not be the product for you. Rich moisturizer but not all natural,sensitive skin
I've been having trouble lately with drier/flakier skin than usual and happy to have a chance to try something new and was pleasantly surprised - especially to find a product with no added perfumes (strong scents send me running for fresh air). The lotion is an easy to handle plastic bottle with a flip top opening (no caps to twist) went on smoothly and has a nice light non greasy feel to it. Using this along with the cleanser I obtained at the same time quite a lot of the winter dryness I've been having trouble with has eased up. No complaints here,Neutral
Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer works great. This moisturizer does not have perfume or dyes to iritate the skin. I apply in the morning and my skin stays moisturized all day. I like the fact tha it does not have the extras like perfumes and dyes. I have been using a while and I am ver satisfied with this moisturizer. This moisturizer works just as well as some of the othr higher prized moisturizers. Mona Lis,Neutral
I live in a desert climate and so in the winter keeping my skin moisturized is both essential and a challenge. The Simple Kind to Skin Replenishing Rich Moisturizer has done a decent job of keeping my sensitive skin from drying out. It's not quite as moisturizing as the cream I was previously using but the lotion does do what it claims to do. There have been a few times when I've needed to reapply it later on in the day. It has not irritated my skin or cause me to break out. I have even used the moisturizer on my two-year-old's face without any concern about added dyes and perfumes.

The Alberto-Culver company an industry giant and the maker of Simple Replenishing rich moisturizer has really done its due diligence in researching what sells a product to the public.  The name itself implies that the ingredients are mostly going to have recognizable names like coconut oil or chamomile or glycerine. A glance at the ingredient list puts paid to that notion pretty quickly.  (Anyone who wants a quick breakdown of ingredients can find them all online as I did; I'm not going to waste time explaining them all.)  Words like natural goodness and purity are used frequently perhaps even a bit excessively to hammer home the point that this stuff is made from things that are picked from the gardens of earth mothers while the morning dew still glistens on their leaves and lovingly mixed in quaint kettles by wise old grannies with twinkling eyes.  The box itself is white and green probably to suggest that the whole enterprise is a green one.  To be fair the box does have the recycling symbol on it but it's the one that means that this product can be recycled not that it's made from recycled materials.My point?  Well I have a couple.  First if you have personal concerns -- sensitive skin or allergies -- always do your homework.  This stuff is billed as being for sensitive skin but I see nothing in it that would be particularly calming to skin.  However in terms of allergies it's true that there are no dyes or perfumes.  This is a very good thing and I wish more companies would follow suit.Second if you have any sort of environmental concern be aware that vague implications of naturalness or the color green on a white box and a recycling symbol means very little. I will point out however that Alberto-Culver does adhere to a strict no animal testing policy for which I applaud them and which earned them an extra star.But wait you say what about the product itself?  Does it work?  Yes it's fine.  I haven't noticed it going above and beyond the call of duty but it seems to moisturize pretty well and it hasn't irritated my skin.  I can't say that I thought it was any better than anything else I've used and in the final analysis I think it's fairly average; in other words it's not what you'd call a winner but you could do much worse. Don't look for any miracles in this bottle.In the end your choice will probably be determined by price and I have to say that I find it pricey for what it offers. Not bad but I hate the way its marketed.,sensitive skin
For those of us who need moisturizer but hate to put it on because it causes your face to look like a greasy mess - this new product from Simple is perfect! It's actually the only moisturizer that I feel comfortable using before going out because it is so simple and natural and doesn't look messy. Nobody will be able to tell you're wearing it which for me at least is a blessing.I will say that this probably isn't right for night time use. If you want a moisturizer to really hydrate your skin and give it a healthy glow in the morning I would recommend something with a little more juice. EvenCetaphil Moisturizing Lotion Fragrance Free -  fl ozis more hydrating in my opinion - but it also leaves my skin looking too greasy which is why I hate to wear it in public.Overall:Pros - Moistens and keeps skin from feeling dry doesn't look sticky or gross on skin. NO perfume dyes etc! VERY IMPORTANT.Cons - Not moistening enough for night time use some people with extremely dry skin may not feel it helps very much. My skin gets pretty dry though (and I live in the desert so the climate is dry too) and I do feel that my skin is getting hydrated and softened with this product. If other products leave your face too greasy I would highly recommend trying this. Gentle yet effective!,dry skin
This is a great moisturizer to use after cleaning your face.  I have oily skin and useSimple Moisturizing Facial Washto cleanse my face prior to moisturizing.  I cleanse and moisturize in the morning and the evening.  I really do not want a moisturizer that will clog my pores and leave my skin feeling oily and heavy.  Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  No greasy oily feeling is left behind or heavy perfume scent.  No harsh ingredients to flare outbreaks.  A tiny bit goes a long ways too.I love the simpleness and look forward to trying out more of the product line. Light and Simple,Neutral

I have a hard time finding lotions that work well for my face. Most lotions that say they are lightweight and won't leave skin greasy still usually do for me. However this Simple Hydrating Moisturizer lives up to the claim of being lightweight. The texture of the lotion is thin (not thick like a body butter or something like that) and is free of colors or perfumes. When I use it on my face it feels very light and not greasy at all. As it's absorbed I find my skin does feel very soft but not oily. I use face washes with Benzoyl Peroxide in them so my face gets very dry and needs something to re-hydrate it. After I apply this lotion the tight/dry feeling I get from using my facial cleanser goes away and my face feels soft and smooth again. The lotions dries on the skin quickly too so I can put my makeup on shortly after applying this lotion. I haven't had any problems with it causing any beak outs or resdness (and just about everything irritates my skin causing redness). It works great for me so I really like it!

This small bottle contains a light moisturizing lotion designed for sensitive skin. To that end it contains no fragrances dyes or irritating ingredients.  The lotion is completely non-greasy. It absorbs well and it really had no scent.  As promised the hydrating effect lasted the day. My skin felt soft but not oily or sticky. The bottle is compact and closes securely making it ideal for travel.My one reservation was the inclusion of mineral oil in the ingredients. I prefer natural oils such as almond olive or jojoba. The jury is still out on the safety and efficacy of mineral oil. Its proponents say it is safe effective and inexpensive. They maintain that it seals in moisture and protects the skin and does not spoil. Opponents are less comfortable about its origin. They claim it clogs pores dries and irritates the skin and may have negative health consequences from liver damage to cancer. Although the deleterious effects have not been substantiated my feeling is better to be safe than sorry.This product delivers on it promises. My skin stayed soft and smooth and I appreciated the fact there were no irritating dyes or perfumes. The moisturizer is light and gentle and may be a good option for those with sensitive but not overly dry skin. Simply Works,dry skin
I have searched for a moisturizer that could soften my skin & keep it softened over the course of the day.  The thicker moisturizers were too greasy for my tastes so I ended up creating a moisturizer by combining different products. This creation produces a wonderful result (soft skin) but it is messy to make.I was skeptical about the Simple Moisturizer because it is advertised as a light moisturizer.  I didn't think that it would do a good enough job & keep my face soft & moisturized.  But it did and it did just as good of a job as my home-made moisturizer.  I also like that it doesn't contain any perfumes or dyes.I do not find Simple to be a thin moisturizer.  My bottle squirts out a pea-size portion that keeps its shape (i use more than this amount).  A thin moisturizer would not do this.  I've used Simple on my hands too and it does a good job of keeping my hands soft.At . ounces the Simple moisturizer bottle is small.  It is great for travel but I wish Simple would produce a larger bottle too.  I may be a convert. Nice Moisturizer that Works Well on My Dry Skin. Small Bottle.,dry skin
This moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs well. There is no greasy feeling after using this product. It contains vitamin B and vitamin E. There are no added perfumes or dyes. It has a very mild fragrance to it which goes away pretty quickly. This lotion is noncomedogenic which is good because a lot of products I have used will give me breakouts. So far I have not had that problem with this lotion. Nice lightweight facial lotion,Neutral
I have sensitive acne prone AND dry skin. And because of the acne I use topical medicines that dry my skin even further. It makes for a frustrating combination because I need something that won't cause breakouts or irritation but that will also keep me sufficiently moisturized.  Ideally I also like a lotion that doesn't just avoid irritation it soothes my skin.  To dateNeutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF    Ouncehas been my go-to lotion because it does all of the above though I've also been really happy withAveeno Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer  Ounce.  Whenever I try a new lotion these two serve as my benchmark.  I was excited to try the Simple line because I know they design all their products for sensitive skin and since that describes mine it appealed to me.In tryingSimple Hydrating Light Moisturizer . Ouncethe first thing I noticed was it had nearly no scent at all.  Since my skin is sensitive I generally try for unscented products but have noticed that even those that claim have no added perfumes still sometimes have an aroma from the other ingredients.  This one had the most neutral scent I've ever found.Next I noticed the texture.  It definitely lives up to the name 'light moisturizer' as I found it very lightweight and almost like a light gel vs. the Neutrogena and Aveeno which despite also being moisturizers are richer and creamier.  Personally I wasn't a fan of the texture.  Especially since I felt like it translated into the lotion's results.From a results standpoint this just did not compare to the Neutrogena and Aveeno products I currently use.  Though it did absorb into my skin quickly my skin still felt tight and dry where as my two current products make it feel very hydrated soft and soothed.  Using more product didn't seem to help.  Also I feel like I would end up using more product over time as although the box advertises a  hour wear time I definitely had to apply more often.  Thankfully despite having really sensitive skin I didn't get any irritation bumps or redness with this product.  But my skin as noted also didn't feel very moisturized either.For the reasons mentioned above I just wasn't a fan of this product.  I think it might have been okay for a normal or oily skin type but for dry skin it just wasn't hydrating enough to keep my skin dryness at bay.  I also feel like for a line developed especially for sensitive skin I expected it to have more of the soothing properties I get with my Neutrogena.  I definitely do not see myself buying this product again and actually I only see myself using the existing bottle as backup because my skin feels THAT much better with my Neutrogena and Aveeno.  It's possible that another one of their moisturizers might be better suited for my skin type but their website does a terrible job of distinguishing between their various moisturizers.Not recommended.

Every year from late fall to early spring my face gets really dried out. The harsh cold and windy weather causes havoc on my skin.  This facial moisturizer helps to treat my dry skin by providing much needed moisture. It makes the dry patches of skin go away at least temporarily. This moisturizer does it's job and nothing more. It doesn't have any added dyes or perfumes that might bother sensitive skin and it has very little scent at all. I don't have bad allergies but I think this would be great for people that are allergic or sensitive to strong scents. Provides moisture and nothing more. No dyes or perfumes,dry skin
I typically use Oil of Olay for my face both the soap and moisturizer.  It is non-greasy while still hydrating.  It is simple with minimal fragrance although it is a little pricey.I am rarely looking for something new since this regime works so well but Simple is an intriguing product as it touts exactly what I am looking for in a moisturizer.  Simple is better than Olay as it is free of dyes and perfumes.  It is hydrating and long lasting also without feeling greasy.The one flaw is Simple is . ounces and more expensive than Oil of Olay for  ounces is here on Amazon.  If skin sensitivity and ingredient lists are more important than price you should try Simple.  The product is good and works well.  It could have been  stars if it was just a little less expensive. Simple: a good clean moisturizer,Neutral
I've been using the whole line of Simple products which are all free of perfumes dyes or harsh irritants so I was a little surprised with two aspects of the moisturizer; one was that it was very moisturizing. I expected a little bit of an old style moisturizer where you can't even tell that you've used it. It is called light moisturizer. It also states that it is hydrating and nourishing for  hours of moisturization which it does.The other surprising thing is that even though this is especially for sensitive skin it made my face sting a little bit when applied. It doesn't sting long but it had done it each time I've used it.I'm kind of torn I like the moisturizing effect but not how it makes my skin feel at first. Surprising Results,little bit
The Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer is a relatively thin high-water content moisturizer that I find works much better if I close my pores with toner before I apply it. Otherwise the moisture evaporates pretty quickly and doesn't seem to leave behind much protection on my winter-dry skin. For me it doesn't hydrate enough overnight however and it cannot replace my usual day cream because it doesn't have sunscreen in it. I have taken to using it when I shower or wash my face during the day and need something light.If you want a light lotion or if you have only mildly dry skin this may be a good choice but it won't zap truly dry winter skin. The good news is that It doesn't have added perfumes and it disappears quickly on the surface of the skin so you won't get that greasy or oily look.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann A Light Moisturizer That Works Best With Toner,dry skin
I have fallen in love with the Simple line of skin products! I really like this hydrating moisturizer with its vitamins and nutrients such as glycerin and borage seed oil. The lotion contains no perfume no dyes and no harsh ingredients so it's great for sensitive skin. My skin tends to be dry and I don't have problems that require special products but this light moisturizer is also advertised as being noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic if that is an issue for you.The unscented moisturizer has only one drawback that may prove to be a deal-breaker with me -- no SPF sunscreen properties. If that is not important to you then I think you will really like this product. I typically useOlay Complete All Day Moisture Lotion Sensitive Skin SPF  Ounceand I must say that it is a difficult choice to chose between the two -- my old favorite and my new love.. stars Simple -  skin experts!,sensitive skin
So far I am having no troubles with this moisturizer. The Simple brand lives up to its claim of no perfumes and no animal derived ingredients. However the long and unpronounceable list of chemicals makes it nearly a % lab creation on synthetic additives.As I said so far I am having no problems or ill side-effects from using this product and I do suffer from sensitive skin and allergies. I would however argue that a product should not tout  hour moisturization while being a light moisturizer. Living in a dry cool & arid state I have to reapply this more than once throughout the day.But it is not greasy and does not clog my pores so reapplication is a small price to pay.

Not long ago I visited my daughter and  year old granddaughter in the UK. Among the things that I noticed in their bathroom were some Simple skin care products so I was interested to see some of the Simple line available to test particularly since I had not long ago run out of the skincare products I have used for some time the ones that come in the pink box.  So let me tell you what I had to work with.  (It wasn't pretty!)I've noticed ever since menopause came my way that my face had become dryer and dryer to the point that it felt like an outing flannel nightgown and definitely showed my age.  Almost nothing has done the first thing to improve the situation - at least until last week.I've been using the following products for a week twice a day except for theSimple Smoothing Facial Scrub --  fl oz which I have been using every other day in the morning.Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel  Ounce (Pack of )Simple Soothing Facial Toner . Ounce (Pack of )Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer . OunceYou can just color me impressed!  I look years younger.  My face no longer feels like outing flannel but is soft & moist my wrinkles are much less apparent and my skin has a healthy glow I haven't seen in some time.I'm even more impressed by Simple's commitment to their customers.  All of their products are non-comedogenic (meaning that they won't clog your pores) and none of their products contain dyes harsh irritants or artificial perfumes (I have very bad reactions to those.)  Everything is hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested some have no scent at all and Simple provides full information about everything that they put into each product right on their website (Simpleskincare dot com) where you can also sign up to the Simple VIP program which includes a monthly newsletter coupons and other special offers.  You'll find lots of skincare advice there too.Better yet Simple is multi-generational.  I happened to be chatting with my granddaughter the night this arrived (she has the most gorgeous complexion!) so when she asked what I was up to I told her I was testing some skin care products from the Simple line.  OMG Gram!  I love that stuff! she exclaimed. OMG - I love that stuff too!Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer . Ounceis scent free.  It contains Vitamin B known to soften smooth and restore skin Vitamin E to moisturize your skin glycerin to hydrate and nourish along with borage seed oil to help moisturize. Only a very small amount less than a spot the size of a dime is needed to moisturize both  your face and neck.Grandma's $. - There's a reason that Simple is the UK's # selling line of skin care products.

Very good moistuirizer. Comes in a small size which is great and makes it portable to carry with you. My wife actually put in her purse.  The product is very easy to use and works great.  Love that it is doesnt have dyes and perfumes.  Really happy with this product and will use again.  I like the products that Simple makes and that they dont have some of the added things. Works Great.,Neutral
I have mixed feelings about this moisturizer. After being very pleased with some of Simple's other products I fully expected this product to be another home run. Unfortunately this was not the case.I found this moisturizer to be on the thin side. It has the consistency of a watered down lotion and feels more watery than moisturizing on my skin. After allowing it to soak into my skin my face did feel somewhat moisturized but not substantially.I have high expectations for moisturizers designed for the face and this one fell short for me. It reminds me of an off-brand inexpensive body moisturizer. I do like that Simple's products are made with no perfumes dyes or harsh irritants and this one did not irritate my skin at all. I just wish it had more of a rich moisturizing quality to it. I really wanted to love this product but it just didn't do it for me. It's not great,Neutral
This moisturizer is definitely light and thin.  The first ingredient is water but it does have glycerin which normally sinks into my skin nicely.  However I had to use  consecutive applications to get a smoother feel to my skin and even now as I write this review I want to reach for my bottle of Jergens Daily Moisture and slather it on my face.Ever since going through the change the skin on my face is dry.  Used to be oily but not anymore.  Especially in the dry months of winter I have to frequently apply lotion.  I was hoping this product would at least last a couple of hours before having to be renewed.  I'm sorry to only give it  stars but I'm just not all that thrilled with it.  And besides that it sort of burns.  I'm wondering if the burning sensation is due to the NaOH that is listed in the ingredients.  It does have a nice light scent which doesn't make me feel ill like a lot of perfumed products do. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer,Neutral
I have several products from this Simple Line.  The company who makes this line is Alberto Culver.This Hydrating Light Moisturizer did leave my skin feeling soft not dry nor oily.  The packaging says it has  hour moisturization.  Frankly I have never seen any product that says it works for  hours actually work for  hours.This moisturizer is dematologist tested hypoallergenic.  It has no perfumes or dyes so that it is suitable for sensitive skin.  I have never had any negative skin reaction using any of the products from this Simple line.It has  Pro-Vitamin B and Vitamin E Glycerin which hydrates and nourishes and Borage Seed Oil which helps moisturize.The one thing I don't understand is how can something that is supposed to be Simple how does it still show a ton of ingredients on it's packaging?

I like the Simple line of products and the Simple Hydrating Light Moisture is no exception. It is just as the name implies very simple without a lot of perfumes and other ingredients.

Simple Hydrating Light is a very light moisturizer that does not feel greasy at all. There is no residue and it goes on easily. It is great after I shave. While there are no perfumes added there is a little smell. I don't know how to describe it but it kind of smells like plastic maybe from the dispenser. The smell doesn't really linger so it doesn't bother me that much. I don't normally use light moisturizer as I need something stronger for my neck but Simple Hydrating Light is a . star product. If it had a totally neutral smell I would probably have bumped it up to a . Some people may not be bothered by the smell so I mention it for accuracy. Light not greasy moisturizer,Neutral

This is a nice simple product that for me does exactly what it is supposed to and exactly what I want.

This winter I've been suffering from dry cracked hands. I've been usingUpper Canada Soap & Candle Naturally Hand Repair Balm Warm Honey Nectar -Ounce Tubes (Pack of ) but I've been disappointed with how poorly it holds up during the winter months - not absorbing.Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer absorbs *really* well leaving my hands feeling nice smooth and soft for quite some time! I've been usingGold Bond Ultimate Lotion Skin Therapy Softening Shea Butter  oz. which is the best lotion. Gold Bond was recommended to me by a friend and I'm so disappointed I hadn't used it sooner. Gold Bond really leaves my hands feeling soft with all of those rough patches disappearing after the first use. Simple I'm happy to report gives me almost that same feel and comfort.I'd recommend either Gold Bond of Simple if you're suffering from dry cracked winter hands. The only downside is price. Currently one . fl oz of Simple is $. through Amazon's Subscribe & Save. Gold Bond at the discount grocery store was $ (with tax) for . oz. For that reason I would go with Gold Bond.One thing I didn't like about the Simple brand was the smell - like a cheap Avon perfume and strong. The smell does go away after a few minutes. Gold Bond has a scent I don't much care for either but it's not as strong. Comparing Simple with Gold Bond Ultimate lotions,Neutral
This Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer is very nice to use because it doesn't have any fragrance and it does a good job for a light moisturizer. It would be a good choice for anyone who has sensitive skin because it doesn't contain any dyes either. This will be especially nice for the summer when any type of fragrance can seem too heavy. I apply it a couple times during the day whenever my skin feels a little dry. I would much rather purchase an inexpensive product like this that does the job than pay a lot of money for one where you know the money is going into fancy packaging advertising and fragrance. This one doesn't compete with my perfume when I wear it and it's great under make-up. A nice light moisturizer without perfumes or dyes,sensitive skin

I have very dry and sensitive skin so I have to be really careful on what products I use on my face but the Simple Kind to Skin Moisturizing face wash does wonders for my face. My face felt clean and my skin wasn't dried out every time I used it. My skin looks and feels healthy and it didn't irritate my already sensitive skin and it didn't cause any breakouts. No harmful dyes or chemicals that irritate your skin also no unnecessary  perfumes and this allows your skin to breathe. Simple Face Wash has added Pro-Vitamin B that will help restore you skin and give it a natural glow.I love the way this makes my skin feel but it didn't give me that much moisturizer and I had to still apply my moisturizer but other then that small issue I love this face wash.

I was excited to try this facial wash but was somewhat disappointed. Honestly the biggest turn-off for me surprisingly was the smell. It doesn't have a strong smell (no artificial perfumes) and I guess I expected it to not have much of a smell. The mild smell it does have was not pleasant to me. This is a white creamy cleanser that seems to do the job alright. However I'd prefer something with a little more grit to it to help exfoliate my skin. Meh - nothing special,Neutral
I'm torn on how to review this product. On the plus side it has a mild neutral scent that is not heavily perfumed. It cleans well has a silky feel and does not leave my skin feeling dry.The negative for me is a big one. I tried this product specifically because it was billed as being pure and free of harsh chemicals. It absolutely is not. The ingredients read like a chemistry experiment. I do my best to avoid things such as sodium laureth sulfate (known to be toxic and can damage hair follicles) PEG- propylene glycol (contains impurities which can among other things lead to cancer) and methylparaben (a preservative that is quickly absorbed through the skin and is being linked to various health complications). The token vitamins tossed into this mess can't make up for the chemical spill.The name 'Simple' and the marketing angle are misleading. I won't use this product again.

This moisturizing facial wash does a great job of removing make-up while being gentle to my skin. It is perfume free and made by the US Alberto Culver Company. Since it doesn't contain any animal products it is perfect for use by vegans and vegetarians. It is suitable for men and women and the tube that contains the product is gender neutral.

This facial cleanser is not too harsh for sensitive skin but it's strong enough to get rid of make-up and typical daily grime.  I'm always trying new facial cleansers looking for the perfect one that is gentle on sensitive skin but that still gets the cleaning job done.  Too many cleansers are abrasive scrubs or include heavy perfumes or chemical dyes.  On the other end of the spectrum are the cleansers that feel more like mositurizers and leave my face coated with make-up residue.  This cleanser is the perfect balance in an affordable package. Not too strong not too weak,sensitive skin
I think when I read no perfumes or dyes I was expecting smelly brown stuff!  Perhaps an exaggeration but you know what I mean.  When you are making natural products with no perfumes or dyes stuff doesn't always look as pretty as the more chemically enhanced versions.  This product was thick very pale light green and pleasant smelling - just like any other product with perfumes or dyes.  So either it has some sort of added scents and color enhancement or perhaps when they say no perfumes or dyes they just mean no really harsh ones that are potentially toxic.  I'm not really an expert on the chemical components of facial scrubs.  I read the ingredients on this and I can't pronounce them which doesn't mean they aren't natural it just means I don't know what they are.But that aside the product is pleasing to the eye and nose.  It was gentle on the skin.  It didn't feel abrasive - some cleansers have kind of a grit to them this did not.  Just left my face feeling a bit softer but no other noticeable difference after washing.A week after use I don't notice any changes in my skin. I didn't think I would so I would say that this is a plus in that it didn't give me a rash or anything negative.  It's just a cleanser not a miracle after all.So it does the job it was designed to do in a pleasant way. A pleasant product.,Neutral
Bottom line for me is: this facial wash seems to do its job well. It lathers and rinses well. My skin seems clean isn't irritated and has its minimum of breakouts. While this doesn't contain perfumes the scent is light and pleasant.For reference I have combination skin and would tend to choose a moisturizing wash like this in winter months. Simple doesn't seem particularly moisturizing just not overly drying; honestly that's all I expect from a product that's in contact with my skin such a short time.Personally I slightly prefer washes with a pump dispenser but this tube seems standard for creamy washes and is effective.Amazon provides a list of ingredients so I'll let you be your own judge as to what you want in a facewash. Note that it doesn't seem to be particularly natural just non-irritating and free of dyes and fragrances. I do consider it a slight plus that this doesn't have fragrance. does the jo,Neutral
I am obsessed with having a clean face before bed and again in the morning before I apply fresh makeup so I am always happy to try new facial cleansers.  I had never before heard of the Simple SkinCare line but dealing with the skin condition Rosacea for years it is imperative that I use products geared toward sensitive skin.  This  oz bottle is the standard upside down storing squeeze bottle most facial cleansing manufacturers have adopted.The front of the bottle states there are  vitamins  skin loving nutrient and  perfumes or dyes.  Reading the ingredient list I am not sure which is which.  Here are the ingredients in the order they are listed:Water Sodium Laureth Sulfate Decyl Glucoside Cocomidopropyl Betaine PEG- Propylene Glycol Oleate Propylene Glycol Panthenol Tocopheryl  Acetate Bisabolol Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil Pelargonium Graveolens Oil Glycol Distearate Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate Polyquaternium- Laureth- Cocomide MEA Sodium Chloride PEG- Glyceryl Cocoate Disodium EDTA Dipropylene Glycol Methylparaben.Wow.  So much for being simple.  Sounds like an entire science lab is in this product.  I had never heard of Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil so I looked it up.  It is a common ingredient in natural products as it is derived from the Anthemis Nobilis flower (in the Chamomile family so take heed if you are allergic to Chamomile).  The Pelargonium Graveolens Oil is what is used to make geranium oil and has a rose scent.  That might be all nice and natural sounding but I can't get past the second ingredient being Sodium Laureth Sulfate.  This and its cousin Sodium Lauryl Sulfate are BAD for your skin.  Over the past year I have stopped using any products that contain them.  Please do a Google  search for them and you will see what I am talking about.  Now stepping down from my soapbox I will simply tell you how the product worked.It is a pearly white color and has a nice smooth texture that comes out of the bottle easily.  I applied it directly to my face with my hands as directed.  It cleaned well (removing all traces of makeup) and had a nice pleasant subtle Rose scent.  It rinsed off fairly easy but not as well as I would have liked.  I noticed the next morning after washing my face again with Simple that my face was a bit itchy.  I am not sure if there is something in the product's many ingredients that I am allergic to or if the cleanser combined with my moisturizer was the problem.  So I am going to experiment again with only putting my moisturizer on one side of my face after cleansing.I guess if you are not concerned about ingredients like SLES (Sodium Laureth) and SLS (Sodium Lauryl) then it is a product worth trying.  I won't recommend it however unless they reformulate and remove the Sodium Laureth Sulfate.EDIT //:  I tested the cleanser regarding the itching issue and it seems that there is something in it that is not combining well with the ingredients in my moisturizer (Olay brand).  I haven't encountered that problem with other facial cleansers and my moisturizer. Issues with Ingredients,sensitive skin
My wife has sensitive skin and has a hard time finding good face care products that don't cause any reactions or breakouts. She loves Simple Kind to Skin. She never had any problems with it drying out her skin causing breakouts having an odd reaction with her other face care products-- no issues. She really appreciate the fact that it wasn't overly perfumey or had a nasty floral scent like a lot of women's face care products do as she is sensitive to perfumes as well. She also says it went on smooth cleaned off well and didn't feel greasy like some other face wash products she has used in the past. For the price amount and quality she says it's a great deal. Great,sensitive skin
For some reason when I was reading about this facial wash I thought it would be made by a company that specializes in organic products since the name of this facial wash is called 'Simple'.Actually this facial wash is made by Alberto Culver a company that makes varied and mainsteam products.What I liked when reading about this facial wash was that it was for sensitive skin and was non-drying.To me this is a standard type facial wash nothing special about it.  It's dermatologist tested hypoallergenic no perfumes dyes no harsh irritants not tested on animals and has no animal ingredients but then many facial washes claim the same product attributes.  There is a LONG list of ingredients for this facial wash which is not unusual either.Upon trying this facial wash it felt cooling on my skin.  It was easy to wash off.  It still left my skin feeling clean tight but soft.  It does have a faint scent to it.For a product that goes by the name Simple it doesn't sound like it is and the ingredients aren't.It would be nice and novel to have a facial wash that was not only effective but has simple easy to pronounce ingredients the fewer the better.I don't think this 'simple' facial wash it that.  It's not bad it's just not that different from many facial products that are already out in the market that have the same claims as this facial wash called 'Simple'.Personally I think I will stick with what Iam already using and use this product occasionally til I use it up. It won't hurt you but Iam not sure how much it will help you either.  Just my opinion.Not what I expected or hoped for.  Sometimes names are deceiving! Not That Different,sensitive skin
I enjoyed using this facial wash. Simple's Kind To Skin washed my face and removed all my makeup. It also smelled really nice... some smells are cloying or harsh but this one had a really light & pleasant fresh smell. Funny it includes no perfume but has a nice smell.One thing I wished it had was more natural ingredients. I guess I should have sought out the ingredient list before assuming that the 'green' innuendos (green packaging the words 'naturally' 'vitamin goodness' and 'kind'). Sounds silly as I type it but I seriously thought this would be a product with a more natural ingredient list! It doesn't.I might buy this again especially if they cleaned up their ingredients. Clean smelling and effective at makeup removal,Neutral
I am a skeptic when it comes to products touted as moisturizing especially facial washes.  But after using this product for a month I have to admit it really does clean (including removing make-up) without leaving me with that dried out skin feeling.  It doesn't overdo the lather - just enough to make it seem like it's working (which it is) and has no perfume-like aroma.  At first squeeze out of the tube I thought the texture/viscosity was a bit strange but once it mixed with water all was good. Overcome My Skepticism,Neutral
These exfoliating facial wipes make my face feel fresh and clean.  These wipes contain vitamins B and E and also aloe vera.  It contains no perfumes or dyes or harsh irritants.  The front of the package also says for naturally healthy looking skin and double sided cleansing action and sensitive skin experts (that's me - the person with the sensitive skin - not the sensitive skin expert).I love facial wipes such as these.  I use these at home but they would also be good for traveling.  The wipes are moist so you wouldn't have to worry about hydrating them.I just love these wipes.  They make my face feel good.  They fill my needs.  Highly recommended if you are in need of facial wipes. Exfoliating Facial Wipes by Simple,sensitive skin
This is a great product and works better than advertised. I use exfoliating soaps and other exfoliating devices. I know they are working because they are scratchy. These Simple Exfoliating Wipes are not scratchy so I thought they were not working at first. Then I could visually see that I was disn-foliated.Yep all them there naturally occurring flaky excesses were removed. I wondered if it did that to my face then want about other body parts. I know what you are thinking; I meant arms. Yep these wipes worked there also.I tested them to see if they really had no perfume. Many items that claim to be fragrance free just have a lower smell level. I tried the nose test and sure enough there is no hint of a weird under smell.One thing I always do and even if the package does not suggest it. Some items like ALOE VERA can cause allergic reaction in some people so I tested a small area first and waited. Turns out that I did feel something (clean).I also find this critter a quick way to spruce up if you are too lazy to hit the shower before bed. This does not replace a good dose of water but cuts down on the itching while you sleep. I have been exfoliated,great product
*I DID NOT USE THIS PRODUCT: REVIEW BASED SOLELY ON INGREDIENTS*I got this product thinking that it would be natural and good for the skin because it says for sensitive skin and its in a green package. It also says that it has no perfumes or dyes but it does have other chemicals and parabens that I do not want to put on my skin. I find this misleading that a company puts a product in a green package calls it simple and continues to put questionable chemicals in it. Misleading full of chemicals and parabens.,sensitive skin
I just bought the SIMPLE brand moisturizer to use at bed time so now I have added this exfoliating wipe product to my night time regime. I like them so far have used them  nights and am glad that they do not bother my sensitive skin.  I'm very fair and have always suffered with sensitive and dry skin so far SIMPLE has a new fan with me they don't fill their products with lots of perfumes or dyes and I appreciate that. If anything changes from this review I will come back and update it but I really think that I will be happy at the end of the pack of  too =) SIMPLE...exfoliating wipes,dry skin
I like the texture and lack of perfume to these wipes. They definitely have a good exfoliating feel to them and my skin felt good afterwards.  I was surprised that there is a lot more wipe than you'd ever need for your face.I'm also a little surprised because I only got one package and not the pack of two but since mine came for free through Amazon Vine I'm not complaining just commenting. Works fine for me,Neutral
These exfoliating wipes seem to do double-duty by removing dead skin and oils -- and then closing up the pores with a toner.  My face feels fresh afterward.  Yes the wipes are textured giving them a little roughness for exfoliation but it's not nearly as rough as a facial scrub.  Use them gently but firmly.  The wipes don't contain any perfume and as the label says no animals were used in the testing of the product.  All is good in the world of facial care!-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann My Face Feels Fresh!,Neutral
I like the texture and lack of perfume to these wipes.  They definitely have a good exfoliating feel to them and my skin felt good afterwards.  My main complaint is that the wipe itself is huge.  There's a lot more wipe than you'd ever need for your face.  I'm also a little bummed since I only got one package and not the pack of two but since mine came for free through Amazon Vine I'm not taking marks away for that. Good product only received one,Neutral
I was truly skeptical about the efficacy of these wipes. I'm an older woman () and find exfoliating products tend to be a bit too harsh. I use Philosophy's exfoliating wash and really like it so it's the bar to beat for me. I found the Simple Exfoliating Wipes to work just as well. I gave it a good two weeks of daily use and found it refreshing cleansing and definitely left my face softer and smoother without any redness rash or sensitivity. The wipes are slightly rough but not even as rough as a paper towel or a cheap napkin which is how the exfoliation occurs. The wipes are scentless no heavy perfumes just a clean refreshing feeling.The benefits were especially visible after a night of too little sleep when all the little creases and wrinkles are out in full force (older ladies you know what I'm talking about here!) and these wiped all that lack of sleep away! The only downside is it's a less environmentally-friendly than I'd like but the huge upside is that this travels way better than a bottle full of some liquid and they were such a fantastic pick-me-up after a long plane ride full of that gross stale air. It's definitely the luxury I will gladly carry on every camping and backpacking trip from now on too. Really Convenient When You Can't Actually Scru,Neutral
I love these wipes.  There is no perfume and my face felt clean and smooth when done. The wipe's texture is a loosely woven but soft.  Just to experiment I used a wipe on my legs.  Since it is winter and they are dry; the skin just flaked off (is that TMI?) and when done nice and smooth.Highly recommend. Pure and clean just as stated.  Love them!,dry skin
I thought this product was a great makeup remover. It is a gentle exfoliating wipe gentle enough to use every day. It has no perfume or dyes and has  vitamins(pro vitamin B & Vitamin E) and also contains aloe vera. My skin is sensitive and I was able to use this every day with no drying effect or breakouts. It left my skin feeling clean & refreshed. I would definitely purchase this product again. Clean & Refreshing!!!,Neutral
Some key points about these wipes:+ Some other reviewers mentioned they are scratchy.  My understanding is that that is the point of exfoliating wipes - the texture helps exfoliate.  They do a good job without being harsh.+ Although not touted to do so they remove makeup completely.+ One great use is for freshening up after a workout.+ Great that they lack scent.  I don't like having enduring perfume scents on or around my face. Refreshing,Neutral
Pros+Feel great on skin+Leave a clean feeling+Skin hasn't shown a bad reaction+ ConvenientCons-Smell weirdAlthough I don't really have sensitive skin I didn't think these were in any way harsh feeling. They felt really nice actually and I was surprised that for feeling so soft they left my face feeling so smooth and clean. They didn't dry my face out either nor did they leave it feeling oily. I appreciate the ease of use as well. Before this I used scrubs which get water all over the counter and the scrubbing beads would get in my eyes-it was annoying. The only thing with these is that you'll need to remove your makeup before hand. They aren't meant to be a makeup remover. They do remove it but I noticed my skin doesn't feel as great as when i remove makeup before use.I put smell as a con; because there aren't any frilly perfumes the only smell there is is from the natural ingredients. It doesn't smell unpleasant. Just not like the rose or peach scented stuff I'm used to. And I certainly appreciate it because I don't want all the extra chemicals going on my face.I certainly recommend these great wipes. They are easy and they work. Great Feeling,sensitive skin
I saw these and just had to try them especially as they were labelled for sensitive skin which I have.  I am over  and had despaired of finding an exfoliating product that would refresh my skin without either ) making it very pink to red or ) seeming to do absolutely nothing.  In all my experimenting with other products those were my two results.Now these exfoliating wipes really work and I will be sure to purchase a larger count next time.  I have used them for  days now and I really appreciate that they DO work and you can tell that the dead cells have been removed but yet your skin is not left feeling dried out or raw.  Just pleasantly refreshed -- a bit like some of the very good astringents/cleansers that have been on the market awhile -- but yet there is no perfume or other odor that would also be a problem as my skin is sensitive to perfumes as well.For me it left my skin just as I would like it - ready to put on my nightly moisturizer! Leaves even more mature skin feeling great!,sensitive skin
These facial wipes have a slightly rough texture to them which gives them the ability to exfoliate your skin. They do a pretty good job of that; except they do not leave a cooling sensation as most other facial wipes do.The plus is that they have no perfume and they do leave your face feeling smooth. The package is soft and you pull a self-sticking tab to open it and press it down to close the package again. About half way through the self-sticking is not as secure which can lead to the wipes drying out. They are not very moist to begin with either which would have made them more refreshing. Rough wipe,Neutral
These facial wipes are the best ones I have found on the market. They are wet enough to remove all of my makeup without having to use multiple cloths but not too wet that they make a mess. I also like that they are alcohol and oil free without any dyes or perfumes that can sting your eyes and irritate your skin. These usually run about $ in stores which is what one of these packs cost. I still haven't figured out why the  pack was almost $ but next time I will just buy one pack at a time. : ) Best face wipes,Neutral
I really like this product.  Great for travel or for a quick face wash when it's late and I just want to go to sleep.  There is no smell: no perfume and no cleanser smell which is nice. Feels very gentle on my skin--no stinging or irritation of any kind. This product is exactly what it says it is: Simple yet effective. simple works,Neutral
Simple is a new product that any woman would like! Just ask my wife! It is made speical for those with sensitive skin. The cleansing facial wipes are just the right size very soft and contain no irritating ingredients like perfumes or dyes. The best feature is that Simple can safely remove mascara waterproof or regular. Simple is as Simple Does,sensitive skin
These come in a foil package with an adhesive tab that opens to pull out one wipe.  There are  wipes in a package.  I received one package from vine.These are the kind of paper cloth that you find in all wipes.  It states on the package that it will remove waterproof mascara.  It also states on the package it is kind to skin.This is very different from what I usually use to take off makeup.  I have dry sensitive skin and while I do not wear waterproof mascara I do wear dark heavy eye makeup.I held the wipe on my eye for a few seconds and it did take off some but not all of the eye makeup.  To get all the makeup off I needed to rub some.  They easily took off foundation and blush.These are similar to other wipes I have used but I do think they are slightly milder.  There is no alcohol perfume or dye and when you have sensitive skin those kinds of things are important.  There is cetearyl alcohol that is a waxy substance that helps lotions feel creamy and makes skin feel smoother it is not the same as drying alcohol.  So when the front says no alcohol they are talking about the drying kind of alcohol.I don't think that I would use these every day but for travel or when you need to get makeup off quickly I think that these would be ideal. Easy & Convenient to Use,sensitive skin
I enjoyed the Simple facial wipes so much I shared them with my brother and mother. They are created in such a way that they are easy to carry with a top that is easy to close in order to keep them fresh. One thing that has always been important to me when it comes to cleansers is that they not leave a perfumed scent or sting. Simple meets that requirement and just leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.I'm already spreading the word: these wipes make it simple to clean and to feel fresh. Definitely something men and women can use and appreciate. These Wipes Make It Simple To Clean Freshen,Neutral
This is a delightful product that works great for removing make up and waterproof mascara! I was happy to have a natural solution free from alcohol oils perfume and dyes that could be potentially harmful to my skin.These facial cleansing wipes don't have any unwanted over fragrant smells. The texture of the wipe isn't to wet nor too dry. I will state it take a few rubs to remove my mascara completely but it otherwise worked great and easily. I liked the option to using other methods to cleanse my face that sometime end up getting water and cream everywhere.The size of this pack is great for use on the go or at home! I totally recommend it. Great Make up Remover!,Neutral
I really like these facial wipes.  With sensitive skin I appreciate the lack of perfumes and dyes.  The wipes are ever-so-slightly drying but I have yet to find a facial cleanser of any type that doesn't leave my face feeling a bit tight right after use.  I typically wear only a light amount of mineral foundation during the day and feeling too lazy to remove the makeup a time or two I have used these wipes for one-step cleansing at bedtime.  They seem to do a good job removing the remnants of the makeup.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again. Refreshing,sensitive skin
The Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes are non-greasyall-natural disposal wipes perfect for the busy mom or teenager. With no perfumes or dyes to irritate the skin they are gentle enough to use every day. They remove stubborn make-up and mascara very easily without having to vigorously rub the skin. The wipes are not too wet nor too dry. What I like best about this product is how my skin feels after using it. There is no oily residue or lingering scent. My skin feels fresh and clean.My teenage son really likes these wipes because they are ideal for usage after sports. Just throw them in the sports bag and they are good-to-go. They really help prevent break-outs from grime and bacteria found lingering on sports equipment.  Also the packaging is gender neutral which is a big plus.If you are looking for a handy package of natural wipes for multipurpose use I recommend this product. Easy simple and pure!,Neutral
Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes are really convenient and easy to use. They're alcohol and oil free which I like a lot. They really do remove waterproof mascara which is great. There are no dyes and artificial perfumes to irritate sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate my skin at all. They're also great for when you travel - just throw them in the bag and go. Also you can get an ever better deal with subscribe and save. Great for travel too!,sensitive skin
I've used facial wipes that cleanse a little better than these with less effort but those have irritated my eyes and the irritation last for hours.  With these I have removed mascara with no problems at all but it does take multiple swipes across my eyelashes.  The mascara I use is not waterproof.They seem to do a very good job of removing the rest of my makeup again with multiple swipes and I like the way my skin feels afterward -- not sticky or oily.  I really like that there are no animal-derived ingredients.  There is no heavy perfume-y smell that some wipes have which is a plus in my book.  They are sized right for a good single cleansing and great for travel when you don't want to haul around bottles and jars of face cleansers.And I don't have to worry about those permanently-stained washcloths.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has bought light-colored washcloths and before long they look like they were used to make mudpies.  Not a pretty sight. Great Around the Eyes,Neutral
Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial WipesStill using a washcloth to remove make-up or freshen up your face and neck?  That is so last Century and a total waste of natural resources to clean/dry/fold/store those things...! :A few reasons I like Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes:the container:  small portable pack filled with a generous amount of good-sized clean/fresh wipe cloths.the cloth:  super soft just the right size extremely durable (no falling apart during use) not too wet or too dry no perfume or alcohol.the results:  Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipe gently cleaned off all makeup -- with no drippy mess or cloth debris left behind (like some facial cleaning cloths) cleaned area dries fast Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes left skin super soft and beautiful -- even Dad likes using Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes for freshening up... (and he is awfully hard to please).*drops used Simple Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipe in trash*  Easy!  Less laundry more time for Me! :) off to buy another case. 'nuf said.

My daughter and I have very sensitive skin and have a heck of a time finding nice facial products that don't cause us irritation.But these cleansing wipes are nice and mild!This gentle cleansing cloth is soothing comfortable and mild. It does a good job cleaning light makeup off my face but does not remove waterproof mascara or the like. That's fine with me because it's so convenient and comfortable. We put the container in the refrigerator to keep the wipes cool which makes using them even more refreshing.These wipes have no oil or alcohol on them using just water and other soothing ingredients like panthenol (vitamin B) and glycerin. They contain no dyes or perfumes either.For people with sensitive skin I recommend giving these a try. They are very convenient for travel or even keeping a few in your purse (in a zippered plastic bag of course) for times when you feel overheated or dusty. You'll like the cool cleansing of these cloths and the lack of irritants to bother you afterward. Ahhh. Soothing!,sensitive skin
I often use Wipes to clean or refresh my face and hands so I have a lot to compare the Simple Brand Cleansing Facial Wipes to.  All in all they are an excellent product.  They had almost no odor nor did they leave that tight medicinal linger.  On the other hand they were not greasy or oily which I find a turn off on a wipe.  The package is the right size to be tucked into a purse or cosmetic bag to take along for the day.  I think that if the price is in the ballpark with comparable items next to it on the shelf - this would be my choice.  In fact I'd even pay a little more for wipes with no alcohol no oil no perfume and no dyes. Kind to your skin,Neutral
Summary of my review below:  If you wear medium coverage (or full coverage) long lasting foundation or heavy/bold eye makeup these wipes will take some time to remove your makeup and you'll use several of the wipes to do so but they do work and they're very handy to use if you don't have running water and regular facial cleanser to remove your makeup.  For those of you who do not use bold or long-lasting makeup - if you only apply light coverage foundation or powder and tend toward very subtle natural-looking eye makeup then these Simple Facial Wipes will work very well for you hands down.  Also I LOVE that these are fragrance free because I have sensitive skin.... scented facial cleanser can make my skin look and feel like it's on fire which is not attactive.Okay now here's my long review with all the little details:My makeup routine:  I wear Almay TLC liquid foundation (medium coverage long-lasting) on my face and neck and upper part of my chest... I'm very pale but my face is pink so pink face transitioning at the jawline to pale neck.  I use foundation to make everything even.  I use under-eye concealer too and after applying foundation I use pressed powder.  For eye makeup I use Urban Decay's eyelid primer potion followed by Urban Decay's eyeshadow (either Sin or Toasted).  I draw a thick bold line of Maybelline Master Drama eyeliner on my upper eyelid only and I use CoverGirl LashBlast mascara (non-waterproof) applied to upper lashes only.Before bed I wash my face makeup off with Olay sensitive skin foaming face wash cleanser (works really well) and I would use fragrance-free baby wipes to try and remove the foundation from my neck and chest (sometimes I just hop in the shower and use body wash if I want my neck and chest really clean of makeup).  Baby wipes kinda work but not great and they sure as heck can't remove eye makeup.  These Simple Facial Wipes actually do a better job of removing foundation even though they're smaller than the baby wipes so they get a thumbs up for that.  Still it took a few wipes to remove my foundation and the Simple facial wipes didn't leave me with the same fresh 'n' clean feeling that I aim for when removing makeup.The real test with these Simple facial wipes was in removing my eye makeup.  I fully expected my eye makeup to give the facial wipes a wedgie and kick sand in its face laughing all the while.  And in the first few seconds that's what happened the wipe just smeared around my eye makeup.  However with almost two minutes of gentle wiping motions I was actually able to get all my heavy black eye makeup off.  Surprise!*BUT* it took  minutes for ONE EYE and that wipe was covered in black smears so the second eye required a fresh wipe.  And it took - wipes to get foundation off my face/neck/chest and still I didn't feel really clean - I've dealt with acne since my mid-teens so I'm obsessed with getting all my foundation off.  Also I'm in my 's and try not to tug my eyelids I'm terrified of causing wrinkles that way and removing my eye makeup with these wipes required more friction on my eyelids than it does with water and face wash.It was really time consuming to use these wipes for me with my makeup and required several wipes so that drives the cost up for me.  On the other hand if your makeup routine in the morning only involves tinted moisturizer or patting some powder on your face then you're out the door I am envious of your perfect skin and these wipes will work great for you.  These wipes are still handy for me with my heavier makeup if I find myself unable to use running water and facial wash but I don't think I'll often find myself in that situation without running water.Did I mention that I love that these Simple facial wipes are fragrance free?  I LOVE that about these wipes.  To anyone who doesn't like these unscented wipes because you prefer a nice fragrance right up in your face go spritz yourself with perfume and please leave these fragrance-free wipes to those of us with sensitive skin.  =) Takes time to remove eye makeup but still handy to use,sensitive skin
I was really surprised with these facial wipes. I have tried so many different brands and they all leave something to be desired - mainly a feeling of residue on your face. These wipes are different!First there is barely any scent at all. No overpowering scents to make you feel like you just swabbed your face with perfume.Second they work fabulously at removing make up even waterproof eyeliner and mascara just as the description says! This was a huge plus for me. They are very gentle around the eye area and cause no irritation whatsoever. No dryness no redness - nothing. They swipe away the makeup residue on the first try.My face actually feels clean after I use them. My skin feels soft and smooth. The wipes aren't overly saturated so you won't feel the need to dry your face after using them. There is no residue left behind - no oiliness no sticky or tacky feeling. Your face just feels clean.I am someone who has to be careful with facial products. My skin doesn't like too many brands. These wipes have been so wonderful in so many ways. They work and do not cause any irritation at all.Highly recommended! Work excellent!,Neutral
The price of this item definitely affects the value but there is no price listed currently on Amazon so I can't comment on what this product is worth dollar wise to me. Simply Kind To Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes come   to a pack and are sold two packs per sale on Amazon meaning you will receive a total of  wipes.  I'm not sure it's a purchase worth buying online.The wipes come in soft packs perfect for throwing in your purse or glove compartment of your car.  There is no alcohol in this product and it did work fine in removing my makeup and waterproof mascara.  My face feels soft after using it.  There is no perfume or dye in these wipes and they can be used for men women and children as a freshen-up cloth if you need one while traveling.  I think this product is best marketed for such use as I have found that anything packaged in soft packs like these wipes are lose their moisture quickly and the wipes dry up before you have finished using them.  Because of my past experience with cleansing wipes drying up so quickly I am not apt to purchase them again unless it's for a special reason like traveling.  These wipes would be welcome when traveling by air when your face can feel dry from the altitude.  I recommend this product for travel.  For everyday home use?  I can't imagine needing individual wipes for that.  It can't be cost effective even if it is handy and beats laundering your wash cloths at home. Depending on the price would work well for traveling!,Neutral
My daughters and I like to use cleansing cloths like these to remove make up and for travel or camping and we've tried a lot of different brands. They seemed fairly interchangeable so we've generally just gone for price.Simple Kind to Skin seems like a real step up. One will take off all your make up including waterproof and  hour types and it leaves your skin feeling soft. This isn't the softest we've ever tried (Shiseido may get the nod for that particularly characteristic) but there's no oil or alcohol so it's very gentle.Since this level of effectiveness means you only have to use one to clean your face this is a more economical and environmentally sound choice than some of the others we've tried and I figure the lack of perfume and dyes also helps keep this relatively green. Best we've tried,Neutral
They say keeping your face clean is one of the foundations for good skin care.  While I don't always like to use facial wipes to clean my face they come in handy when you are traveling or don't feel like spending a lot of time cleaning your face.  These wipes do the job.One thing I noticed when I opened the package is that they aren't overly scented.  Some skin care products smell like a perfume bottle.  These wipes have a slight scent and it is pleasant.  These wipes are thick and soft unlike some bargin brands these will feel like a luxary to use.I find these fairly effective in cleaning old make up from your skin.  These removed everything but the Christian Dior super thick mascara that I love.  Now these wipes did get most of the mascara off but that rares comes off easily.  I would definitely pick these up when it comes time to restock. Works well with little scent,Neutral
The best aspect of this product is its lack of heavy scent.  This is especially important to those who have sensitive skin and react adversely to perfumes dyes and chemicals meant to give the wipes a pleasant fragrance or appearance.  They are extremely gentle to the skin.The wipes are sturdy and fairly thick.  They work well in removing light make-up but I'm not sure how they'd do with thickly-applied cosmetics.  The package is convenient for two reasons:  it permits the wipes to retain their moisture and it can be packed neatly when traveling.  There is no alcohol or oil in the wipes.  They therefore don't dry the skin needlessly or feel greasy.The wipes would be perfect if they were larger in size.  It's often necessary to use two wipes to remove make-up completely.  With a larger size the wipe could be repositioned to get everything off.It's the disposable-product age and these wipes avoid using cloth towels that might stain and have to be laundered.  Use it and chuck it way.  Nothing worse than taking a towel out of the washing machine only to see mascara or eyeliner stains imbedded forever.  The wipes are neat fast and convenient. Easy to use gentle to the skin convenient,dry skin
Winter is so hard on my skin; it gets so dry and flaky.  It does not help that I have a terrible habit of going to bed with make up on.  So since winter started I have been making an extra effort to wash all my make up off and put on moisturizer before going to bed.  Sometimes I have trouble getting off the eye makeup which is why I was so excited to try the Simple Kind to Skin wipes.The first thing I noticed about the wipes when I opened the package was that there was no heavy perfumed smell.  I have really sensitive skin and allergies to some dyes so the fact that these cleansing wipes appeared to have little to no fragrance was good news for me.  I also immediately noticed how soft the wipes were and they were thick.  I guess I expected them to be thin but these were quite sturdy.I could immediately see upon use that the wipe was doing a great job of removing my make up.  The package indicated it would remove waterproof eye make up and it certainly did.  It took a few swipes over my eyelids concentrating on the lashes to fully remove the eyeliner and mascara but when I was done there was no trace of make up left on my face.  My skin felt really clean without feeling dry or tight the way some cleansers can leave your skin.I liked the packaging it was compact and resealable.  It seemed like it was quite convenient for traveling.  All in all I give these a big thumb up. I really liked them!,sensitive skin
There's a wide variety of facial wipes out there so I put this new wipe from 'Simple' through it's paces and it proved to be a superior product.Pros- Completely removes all makeup dirt and sweat with one side of one wipe even stubborn eyeliner and mascara.- Test results: no makeup was found on a second wipe; but makeup was found after first using a facial scrub. In other words one `Simple' wipe gets all makeup.- Easy to use - you don't have to wet your face first.- No residue - face feels incredibly fresh looks radiant and youthful.- Vitamin B really does help soften and smooth.- No alcohol or oil - so it's non drying and totally not greasy.- Dermatologist tested with no perfume or dyes - so both men and women can use and doesn't cause breakouts.- Ophthalmologist tested - so doesn't bother eyes so you can get eyeliner and mascara off with no worries. Safe for sensitive eyes and contact wearers.- Simple packaging that is easy to use.Cons- UK product not sold in the USA yet; but will be available through Amazon for a start.

Made with witch hazel and chamomile this toner is formulated without dyes or artificial perfumes.  The water-like liquid is applied with a cotton ball.  I found it to be refreshing and left my skin feeling smooth and soft. I have mildly sensitive skin but suffered no irritation at all.Toners balance skin ph and tighten pores. I generally avoid them except in the summer because they tend to be too astringent. But looking at all the gunk I  put on my face from moisturizers and serums sun screen and makeup the extra layer of cleansing is probably necessary.

I tried the Simple Toner in conjunction with Simple Face Scrub & Simple Hydrating Moisturizer. As a trio the products did a great job of cleaning my face keeping it moisturized and warding off break-outs.However I'm not sure how much of a role that the Toner played in the face cleansing routine.  The Simple scrub does a good job of cleaning (although it is a gritty cleaner) & the moisturizer does a pretty good job of moisturizing so what does the toner do?The toner is suppose to trap moisture in the upper layers of skin - maybe it does maybe it doesn't.  The moisturizer does.  Toners are suppose to cleanse the skin & shrink the appearance of pores but the Simple Toner container only talks about soothing skin & tightening the pores (is cleaning for another product?).  Consequently I'm not sure if the Simple toner is an essential part of the face cleaning line-up.In any event the toner is perfume & dye free.  It does not irritate my sensitive face skin.  Additionally I have not experienced any break-outs while using the toner but my skin is not prone to frequent break-outs. OK. Non-Irritating But Not Sure of Effectiveness.,Neutral
The Simple Facial Toner is a witch hazel based toner which is gentler and less drying than alcohol based ones. The whole simple line of facial products contains no perfumes dyes or harsh irritants.This toner gives my skin a fresh and clean feeling! Witch Hazel Based Toner,Neutral
Before using the Simple Soothing Facial Toner I used theSimple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.  If you want to exfoliate or scrub you might consider using theSimple Smoothing Facial Scrubinstead.  My skin isn't as sensitive and prone to outbreaks as some people's however I do like to stay away from using any harsh chemicals.  I definitely liked the entire experience of using the Simple line of products.First I used the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel then the Simple Soothing Facial Toner and then moisturized. After any facial treatment you'll want to use a moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out.  If you want to stay with the same product line theSimple Replenishing Rich Moisturizeris now an Add-on item.  There are several positive things about the Simple line that are very appealing to me especially the lack of harsh chemicals.~  Simple Smoothing Facial Toner has vitamin B- which helps restore soften and smooth and vitamin E moisturizer which helps improve skin condition.~  It has chamomile which is  known to help gently soften and soothe the skin.~  It has witch hazel which is  known to help tone and tighten pores.~  It has allantoin an ingredient that helps alleviate skin discomfort.~  NO perfume NO dyes NO harsh irritants.~  It has been tested by dermatologists.~  It's  Noncomedogenic (it doesn't clog the pores of the skin).~  It's hypoallergenic.INGREDIENTS:Water (Aqua Eau) Sorbitol Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract Panthenol Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Allantoin Sodium PCA Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate Propylen Glycol -Bromo--Nitropropane- -Diol MethylparabenWHAT ARE THESE INGREDIENTS?Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B):  Ingredient that helps restore soften and smooth skin.Propylene Glycol (Humectant):  Ingredient that attracts water to hydrate the skin.Methylparaben (Preservative):  Ingredient that helps to inhibit the development of micro-organisms.Sorbitol (Skin Conditioner:  Ingredient used to enhance the appearance of skin.Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (Emollient):  Ingredient that works on skin's surface to give it a soft and smooth texture.Allantoin (Soothing agent):  Ingredient that helps alleviate skin discomfort.Sodium PCA (Humectant):  Ingredient that attracts water to hydrate the skin.Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate (Surfactant):  Ingredient that is added to cosmetic products to clean or remove dirt and oil from the skin.-Bromo--Nitropropane--Diol (Preservative):  Ingredient that helps to inhibit the development of micro-organisms.

Not long ago I visited my daughter and  year old granddaughter in the UK. Among the things that I noticed in their bathroom were some Simple skin care products so I was interested to see some of the Simple line available to test particularly since I had not long ago run out of the skincare products I have used for some time the ones that come in the pink box.  So let me tell you what I had to work with.  (It wasn't pretty!)I've noticed ever since menopause came my way that my face had become dryer and dryer to the point that it felt like an outing flannel nightgown and definitely showed my age.

I have never really used toners believing that at best they're unnecessary and at worst actually harmful. I believe if you need an extra product to clean your skin after cleaning you're doing it wrong or using the wrong product.However I was willing to give this one a chance as I have had good results with other products from this line.I have used this to do quick cleanses after working out or when I don't have the time or am too lazy to get out the cleanser and the clarisonic. It removes dirt and makeup without overcleaning and drying -unlike every other toner I've ever tried.I prefer more natural products and hate anything that smells artificial or perfumed. This has a natural clean scent that is subtle and dissipates quickly.I don't have sensitive skin so I can't speak to that but I experienced no redness or irritation THIS TONER SKEPTIC IS WON OVER,sensitive skin
After using this product my wife says that her face feels very refreshed and it seems to be doing a great job.  The product is very easy to use and works very well so far.  Love that it is alcohol free and doesnt have dyes and perfumes.  Really happy with this product and will use again.  I like the products that Simple makes and that they dont have some of the added things. Very Refreshing!,Neutral
As I've aged my skin has morphed from oily to sensitive combination and the products I used to use are now too harsh. This toner works to clean and refresh without drying or irritating my face and since it is without perfumes it has a nice light scent. The ingredients are not all natural using a natural food store standard but they combine to make a gentle but effective product. Gentle but effective,Neutral
My skin is quite sensitive to anything I put on it.  While I already have a toner that I like I wanted to give this one a try since it is free of dyes and perfumes and is specifically made for sensitive skin.  It leaves my face feeling and looking smooth but I don't find it quite as deep cleaning as my go-to tonerBurt's Bees Garden Tomato Toner.  Even after washing my face the Burt's Bees toner still pulls a good deal of dirt off my skin and onto the cotton ball.  But this toner doesn't grab as much of the dirt as the Burt's Bees toner.If you are looking for a gentle toner that is free of dyes and perfumes this is a good choice.  But if you like your toner to also do a bit of deep cleaning this may not be the best choice. Nice and gentle for sensitive skin but doesn't deep clean as much as others,sensitive skin
Before trying this product I was not much of a toner girl. I've tried toners in the past but failed to see the benefit as they all felt like I was basically wiping water on my face.With this toner however I did notice a difference after use. Per the directions I placed a generous amount on a cotton round and applied it to my face in an upward circular motion. The cooling sensation I felt when applying it was wonderful and when I was finished my skin felt refreshed.I love that this product contains witch hazel and is free of perfume dyes and harsh irritants and unlike some other natural products that are free of perfumes this one did not have a particularly overpowering or unpleasant scent. Overall I'm very happy with this product. Refreshing!,Neutral
Sometimes my skin is very oily and I use a Toner to help. However Simple Soothing Facial Toner can be used on oily normal or dry sking without any adverse effects. Leaves skin smooth and soft. There are no alchols or perfumes so it does not dry skin out like a lot of tones do. This tones goes great with the other products in this line. Mona Lis,Neutral
I usually use Biore products b/c I have pretty sensitive skin. Simple has no perfumes or dyes which makes it great for my skin. This toner is also alcohol free so it has a goes on nicely leaves a clean feeling without burning. I also like that it's made in America. Overall I'm very happy with this product and am going to make it part of my usual face care regime. Great for sensitive skin,sensitive skin
This toner has now become a regular part of my daily routine.  It's great for sensitive skin and since they don't use perfumes my allergies don't get out of control.  More than anything it's truly refreshing.  It's actually kind of a nice wake-me-up during my morning routine. It's clear with no dyes and goes on very easily leaving no weird residues behind.This has moved to my automatic purchase list! I'm officially a fan!,sensitive skin
This toner does an excellent job.  My skin feels clean and fresh. The cooling effect is great.  My pores appear smaller and it removes makeup residue left over after I wash my face.  I like the gentle scent also.  No burning or over dryness.  In addition I like that it is % Alcohol Free without dyes or artificial perfumes.  The witch hazel did not bother my skin at all. It is a little pricey. Ahhh!  Clean and fresh,Neutral
Simple Brand from the UK has been around for  years yet is relatively new to the United States. There are no dyes perfumes and all the products are perfect for sensitive skin. I've used the facial wash exfoliating wipes and scrub and all have left my face feeling clean and fresh with a healthy glow and no breakout side effects.Simple's Soothing Facial Toner is outstanding and is absolutely a perfect prep before moisturizing and applying makeup. Makeup glides on seamlessly because the toner shrinks pores without drying making applying foundation and eye color a breeze. At the end of the day Simple's toner removes the last traces of dirt and makeup with a simple cottonball. Excellent product that's sure to grow in popularity here in the States.

My go to facial cleanser of choice is a wash with an exfoliant in it. My color-stay foundation can be a bit stubborn to remove so I usually need something with some texture in it to scrub the makeup off my skin and out of my pours. This Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub has a good amount of exfoliating particles in it so it does a nice job of removing oils old skin and makeup from my face. I don't find the exfoliation of this scrub so dense that it makes my skin feel raw after using it. But for anyone not use to using exfoliants or with super sensitive skin they may find the scrub makes their skin feel a little tender after using it. The scrub is not as dense as some brands like theSt. Ives Apricot Scrub but does have just about the right amount of exfoliating particles for use with more sensitive skin types. There's no perfumes or dyes but it does have it's own mild soapy smell. It's a nice combination of face wash and scrub that cleans skin will and leaves my face feeling refreshed not dry. I like it. A mild exfoliant that's easy on the skin,sensitive skin
Like most of those who are trying and reviewing this product I have sensitive skin.  I'm fair-skined with freckles and I react redden and break out easily when I come in contact with many products.  To me the smell of this product is neutral I'm actually happy that it doesn't have any perfume or scent.  The granules are rather large.  However even in the dry winter months this product has not irritated my skin.  It also doesn't dry it out which is always a concern for me since I have to battle with dry skin.  I've shared how I use the product to get the best results based on my skin type.I use this as an alternating cleanser.  Meaning it is not my only face wash.  Instead I use it a few times a week when I feel I need to exfoliate.  I don't use if I've been wearing makeup.  This will not remove makeup well - it will leave you with foundation residue. You'll end up having to wash your face several times.  Instead I use it on a makeup free face for best results. It doesn't matter if I use it in the morning or night.  It doesn't irritate my skin or cause blotchy redness so you can use it prior to applying makeup.  It also doesn't dry my skin out which is really nice.  My skin doesn't feel 'stripped' of all the oils.  However my husband tried it and did not care for it.  He has oily skin so he didn't feel 'clean' after using it.  Based on this I think those who tend to have dry to normal skin will like the product - but those with oilier complexions will not.  He complained that he felt like he had a waxy residue left on his face where I felt that I was still moisturized.All in all this is a good supplement cleanser when you want to gently exfoliate but wouldn't count on it as an everyday or twice a day cleanser - especially if removing makeup. Gentle Exfoliator,dry skin
I usually use Clean & Clear with the microparticles as a daily face wash so this product is pretty similar for comparison's sake.  That product as well as this one both have particles to help scrub your face without having to use a washcloth.  I've noticed that Clean & Clear is the gentlest on your face in terms of the particle smoothness and size.  The store brand version of C&C; has larger less even particles.  The Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub is the roughest of the three.  When it says it contains rice granules believe it.  They are rough and feel large.  Short of scrubbing your face with a loofah I don't know any other product that would be better at scrubbing.  I take this as a preference thing - if you want something that's aggressive this is your product.I do think it does a very good job of making your skin look and feel clean so I do give it some positive points for that.  No perfumes does not mean it has no smell.  The lack of perfumes does leave it and your face smelling a bit chemical-ly since it's just the smell of the raw ingredients (mineral oil etc) with nothing to counter-balance them.  So while it does its job be aware it's pretty rough and doesn't have a very good smell. Liquid loofah,Neutral
I live in southern Arizona and we are now in the dust-blowing season.  I have normal skin but I prefer using sensitive-formula products for my hygiene regimen.  This product is as mild as it is advertised to be and yet does cleanse the pores of any deep grime with little fuss.  My face felt refreshed and yet clean after one scrub and slightly moisturized as well.This stuff does not contain annoying perfumes which is also a plus and doesn't contain astringent which stings some skin types.  This is mild enough to be used several times again for a quick cleansing.I have now tried several Simple products and have enjoyed all of them.  This scrub goes well with the toner and light moisturizer. Gently removes heavy grime,Neutral
This is a really nice facial scrub. I have been usingSt. Ives Apricot Scrubfor years and I've been wanting to switch over to a milder scrub for some time now. This scrub is milder than the St Ives. Its scrubbing beads are rice granules. They are pretty gentle and not too rough on the skin but provide enough exfoliation to get that clean feeling. This cleanser contains no dyes or perfumes. It has a very subtle scent to it. It cleans well and leaves no residue when you rinse it off. good facial scru,Neutral
Overall I'm pleased with this face scrub. It is effective but unlike other scrubs I've used it doesn't feel like you're rubbing sand over your face. It hits the right balance between gentle and scrub.It lathers nicely as well and leaves my face feeling clean. My complaint is with the scent. While it boasts as being perfume free the smell is not to my liking. It's hard to describe - sort of botanical but not in a good way. Other perfume-free scrubs I've used such as Aveeno smell more soap-like and pleasant.The scent is not so bad that it prevents me from using it but I don't think I'd get another bottle. Five stars for performance;  for scent; average of . Works well but odd scent,Neutral
I've been using the whole line of simple facial products. The scrub is really good. I don't use it every day but a few times a week. Makes my skin feel extra deep cleansed. The whole line contains no perfumes dyes or harsh irritants.The facial scrub is not very thick or creamy. I like the texture and the amount of grit in the scrub which isn't harsh but just right. The grit is provided by rice granules. Nice Facial Scru,Neutral
Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub is gentle non-irritating and exactly the facial scrub my more mature skin needs.  This product does not dry the skin; it does not cause the tightness so many similar products do.Tiny beads are contained in a lightly scented base; the scent is the product of the ingredients in the base rather than from added perfumes.  These do a nice job exfoliating the skin yet they are not rough or harsh.  Skin feels clean and fresh following the use of Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub.  Although this product is a bit more expensive than average because of its positive attributes Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub is one you may want to use.

After using the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub my skin actually felt cleaner and softer.  When I tried it it was very obvious that it was a scrub because I could feel the rice granules as they exfoliated.  My skin isn't as sensitive and prone to outbreaks as some people's however I do like to stay away from using any harsh chemicals.  If you don't care to exfoliate and want a lighter gel cleaning you may wish to try theSimple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.  I also have this and liked the light cleaning factor.First I used the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub then theSimple Soothing Facial Toner and then moisturized.  I didn't however care for the smell of the facial scrub.  It was rather odd but not overpowering.  If you want to stay with the same product line theSimple Replenishing Rich Moisturizeris now an Add-on item. You'll definitely need to moisturize as any scrub can dry out your skin.

While I've heard for years about the dangers of facial scrubs on skin and how to avoid the gritty ones I've had quite the trouble adjusting to the alternative scrubs which don't always get the job done.  The market is full of supposed facial scrubs that are nothing but cleansers with scrub slapped on the bottle.This facial scrub however brought my memory back to the good ol' days of scrubby scrubs.  This is gritty enough to make my skin feel like it really did get a decent scrub-down.  And I was pretty darn happy about it.The consistency is rather like a very thin version of the St. Ives' Apricot Scrub--not as gritty but still enough to get the job done right.  The rest of the product was similar to a face wash so I would suggest this as a dual purpose item.  I've used other Simple facial products and I'm quite in love with the smell which this also gives off--very clean more happenstance than perfumey.  The scrub rinses well from my skin leaving it feeling soft scrubbed and definitely cleansed without any weird residue.Due to the gritty nature I would not recommend this as an everyday scrub but maybe - times a week perhaps as an alternative to an at-home microdermabrasion.  The rice granules used as the grit are not as harsh as other choices I've seen but still are quite gritty for good or bad.  Also for those who are not like me and don't like the scrubby feeling this is definitely a no.But for those who must have the scrub completely with the sensation and are looking for a good reasonably price product this is great. For those who like their scrub to be well scrubby,Neutral
The Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub is an effective cleanser if you can live with the unique scent.I've now tried a couple Simple skin products and on the whole I've been pleased with them.  The Simple Facial Scrub is no different.  I have moderately sensitive skin that is typically very dry during the winter months and prone to random breakouts.  I've been using this product twice a day for over a week now and can happily report that I haven't had any breakout or blemish problems.While I generally prefer pumps the Simple Facial Scrub comes in a tube with a cap that pops open easily and is able to dispense the cleanser precisely.  The scrub itself is an off-white color with a consistency similar to toothpaste.  It doesn't lather or foam but it only takes a nickel-to-quarter sized amount to spread over your whole face.  There are rice powder granules in the scrub and I felt like they were effective exfoliators.  They were similar in size to granules found in the popular St. Ives apricot scrubs.  A  second massage and rinse was all it took to get a smooth finish on my skin.  I think the product does a great job keeping my face clean and free of dry skin debris.  The downside in my opinion is the scent.  Simple says that there are no perfumes or dyes added but that doesn't mean that it is scentless.  Instead there is a rather powerful smell--one that I can only describe as the equivalent of a strong bar of white soap.  I can tolerate it now after a week but it's really noticeable during the first few uses.In the end if you already are using a sensitive skin cleanser and you're happy with it I wouldn't recommend switching to this product.  However if you're still on the look out for an effective sensitive skin cleanser especially an exfoliating scrub then I would definitely give the Simple Smooth Facial Scrub a shot. Smelly Scrubby,dry skin
Like I've stated in other reviews I absolutely love this line of products! Simple products are just that simple. And sometimes simple is best. Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub does what it says. It gently cleans and scrubs your skin smooth. And although your skins emerges clean and dirt free it is not left over dry and tight. Like other Simple products it is not heavily perfumed which is great. You are left with just simply clean skin. Simply Smoothing Facial Scrub is another home run for this great line of products! Simply Awesome!,Neutral
There is no question but that this gentle exfoliating facial scrub performs well.  The solution is of a consistency that needn't be diluted with water in order to make it usable.  It feels terrific and soothing when you are applying it according to directions never corrosive (the abrasive elements are rice granules) and once the microdermabrasion is complete the solution washes off easily leaving the face fresh comfortably soothed and visibly brightened.The reassuring aspects of this product is that it is made of all natural products (and that is likely the reason the packaging is green!).  The addition of vitamins known to nourish the post-exfoliated skin also gives the user the confidence that nothing of values has been cleansed away: there is no sense of dryness even before adding the recommended moisturizer.  And while the label states `no perfumes' there is a refreshing scent of mint that enhances the feeling of healthy cleanliness.The only aspect of the product as advertised on the Vine Program is that this product is listed as `Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub  Ounce  (Pack of )' whereas what arrives is a single tube! But the company SIMPLE needn't worry: one use of this product and the user will almost assuredly order more!  Grady Harp January  Lives up to the package insert ....almost,Neutral

I am a fifty-year-old male who never outgrew his oily acne-prone complexion.  I can wash my forehead and an hour later it is shining like the full moon.  Fortunately a few ago I learned about exfoliation through the Amazon Vine Program.  They mailed me the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System (Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System . Fl Oz).  Within two weeks I noticed a remarkable difference in my complexion.  It felt cleaner and smoother appeared less oily and more vibrant and there were fewer blackheads and pimples.  The gentle sloughing of dead cells from my skin greatly improved my complexion by preventing the clogging of pores.  The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System came with a cleansing brush that has a rotating head with bristles and a tube of exfoliating cleanser.  Any facial cleanser/wash is satisfactory provided that it exfoliates the skin.  It doesn't have to be manufactured by Olay.The Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub  Ounce is great for exfoliating my oily skin.  (Oily skin can be both a curse and a blessing; it is more acne prone but it is also less likely to suffer from premature wrinkling.  As I stated earlier I'm a fifty-year-old male but people think I'm still in my mid to late thirties.)  The Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub has not dehydrated or damaged my skin in any manner.  I use a pearl-size drop of the white lotion twice a day--once in the morning before I shave and once in the evening before I go to bed.  It has a faint nearly undetectable odor that does not annoy me like some lotions creams or soaps.  Tiny scrubbing granules mixed in with the lotion enhance the exfoliation process.  (Those individuals with complexions that are already too dry will not want to use this product.)  Within only a week I noticed that my complexion was smoother and less oily and it glowed with vitality; it was not red scaly or itchy.Those with dry complexions may want to consider using the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash [Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash  Ounce (Pack of )]. I also reviewed this product for the Amazon Vine Program and discovered that it worked just as well as the exfoliating cleanser that came packaged with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  It was also less expensive.  The Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash is gentler on one's skin than the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub; it didn't have the large scrubbing granules that make one feels as though they are rubbing their face with sandpaper.  Carefully choose your facial wash like you choose your hair shampoo and conditioner.  I highly recommend the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub for both men and women who have oily complexions like my own.  This economical exfoliate--a five ounce tube should last a few months--has a pleasant appearance and faint smell that won't clash with colognes and perfumes.Joseph B.

I already use a Nivea facial scrub but decided to give Simple a try because it's supposed to be natural and gentle and all that.This is a facial scrub so it contains exfoliants in this case crushed rice granules. This works like sandpaper so a facial scrub isn't something I use everyday. I use scrubs once in a long while.Secondly the bottle says this is perfume free but it has a very strong smell of Windex. I really had to look at the bottle twice to check that it didn't have any fragrance of any kind or used any harsh chemicals. Then I checked the other reviews and can confirm that my nose isn't tricking me it does have a very strong smell.The smell is so strong and off putting that in all honestly I can't use this product. The smell is coming from something whatever it is my nose is telling me not to use it.So unless you have anosmia I would not recommend this product. Strong scent...,Neutral
In my teens I was diagnosed with acne rosacea and have battled both aspects for over  years.  In those decades of using prescription medication and topical creams hypoallergenic cleansers and medicated makeups what I have learned simply is that less is more.  What has really helped the most?  Unfortunately menopause.  However even today diet and stress cause me outbreaks and my skin will react within a day to many soaps or makeup products.  So as far as what I put on my face I use as little as possible and as a result normally break out less.  Recently I started breaking out on my forehead with tons of pimples and decided to try this product.In using this scrub per the directions and no other cleanser for the past week and a half once a day my skin has calmed down.  The  pimples that I had on my forehead are gone and at the moment there are no new ones.  Honestly.  I am impressed.  While there are no added perfumes or dyes there is a light fragrance which reminds me of...rice which is the exfoliation ingredient.  Ordinarily I do not agree with self-serving adjectives placed on the product but in this case the scrub really is soothing and gentle reminding me of a spa experience I had years ago.  For me personally the price is fair considering Simple did calm down my flare-up and therefore in my opinion is worth a try.  I intend to continue using Simple and will update this review regarding how it works over more time. Best five minutes of my day,Neutral
I like to use a facial scrub at night to get all of my makeup off of my skin and prepare it for moisturizing.  This product is clean and clear and simple to use.  It does what I expect a scrub to do. I use it sparingly and use my fingertips with light pressure. I haven't seen any ill side affects and I will continue to buy this and use it.  It does what I want from a skin scrub gets all the day's makeup and gunk out and leaves me with soft skin and my favorite moisturizer can now reach down into my skin.I detect no scent.  I'm not an owner of a highly sensitive nose but I don't understand all the negative commentary about the scent.  I also like the packaging and the fact that it dispenses from the bottom of the bottle. I can stand it up on my shower ledge and the product will always be available on the bottom.  It's the small things that make an item user friendly that's why I mention this.  This is not designer scrub but it does the trick and keeps it simple.  Won't mask the scent of your perfumes either. simply good,Neutral
This scrub has a thick but not greasy moisturizing base and fine granules for effective but not excessive exfoliation.  It smoothed easily onto my face and rinsed off easily too.  My face feels soft now and I had no adverse reactions.  This product has no added perfumes but users should be aware that there is a scent though it is a light one.  I think it smells a bit cucumber-ish which I find pleasant for skin care products and it works well aesthetically with the green packaging (yeah I like stuff like that).  I actually wish the scent was stronger but I understand that this is meant to be a scent-free product.  That's just my own personal preference.  I was pleasantly surprised at how large the tube is- much larger than most facial care products so it should last for a bit of time.  All in all I'm happy with this scrub. Nice and Gentle,Neutral
I have fairly dry skin on my face (especially in the winter months) so when selecting a scrub I tend to go for the products that have some type of abrasive in them. This one contains rice granules. They're not overly large - the scrub has a gritty texture to it but I wouldn't call it chunky like some other scrubs I've tried (see customer images for a close-up of the product). Once I began working this scrub into my skin however I found the fine granules to be plenty sufficient at sloughing off the dry skin.After rinsing the product off my face I found my skin to feel smooth and refreshed. I followed up with someSimple Soothing Facial Toner . Ounce (Pack of )and am very pleased with how soft and smooth my face feels.I would say I've found my skin to be sensitive to certain products over the years but I think the same can be said for just about everyone. As for this product it did not irritate my skin in the least.Because this product is free of perfumes it doesn't have the most enticing scent in the world but it's not horrible either. I'm not really sure how to describe the scent... I wouldn't exactly call it a chemical scent but it's reminiscent of some natural cleaners I've used. Like I said it's not horrible but since it is present I thought it was worth mentioning.Overall I'm extremely pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a scrub with a bit of grit to it that contains no perfumes/dyes/harsh irritants. Great scrub!,dry skin
I usually use Biore products b/c I have pretty sensitive skin. Simple has no perfumes or dyes which makes it great for my skin. The scrub has a nice combination of grit/cleanser so it leaves my skin feeling smooth without over drying. It has a clean scent that is not overpowering. I also like that it's made in America. Overall I'm very happy with this product and am going to make it part of my usual face care regime. Great Scru,sensitive skin
I have mixed feelings about this facial scrub.  It contains rice granules which is what scrubs your face but the granules are bigger than I expected though I guess they do what they're supposed to do.  What really surprised me about this product was the strong scent.  The scent is almost like a lemony cleanser - I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but it is MUCH stronger than I expected for a product that claims to have no artificial perfumes.  The scrub does wash off nicely and doesn't leave a film or anything on your face and afterwards your face does feel very smooth.  I didn't experience any breakouts or anything when I switched which was a bonus.  Overall I like the product but if scented products bother you this one will likely be too strong and I would suggest finding an alternative. Just OK,Neutral
After using this for a couple of weeks now I can say that my skin is smoother and prettier.  I have very sensitive skin and have noticed no rash or irritation.  My skin type would probably be called combination - dry around the forehead area and oily around the nose/chin.  The scrub seems to work well on all parts of my face oily or dry.  Since there are no perfumes there's only the mildest of scents and the scrub doesn't get my allergies going.All in all a good product that I'll continue to use! A Truly Gentle Scru,sensitive skin
Prior to using this product I researched it extensively and read tons of reviews both here on Amazon and all over the Internet.  The majority of those reviews ranged from positive to lukewarm but it seemed like a scrub on which I could safely take a chance.  That take a chance part is key because my skin is extremely fair and super-sensitive - sometimes it seems like if I even look too long at a new different product my face will break out.  Therefore I am really wary when it comes to trying new skincare products but my face got to a point where I was desperately in need of something that would exfoliate some dry flaky patches and brighten up my skin tone a little bit.  So I read the aforementioned reviews and picked up this scrub.From the moment I popped the top the smell made itself known.  The packaging may say that it's fragrance-free but  while that may pertain to the fact that they didn't add perfume into the scrub something in there gives it a very distinct strong smell that is a cross between medicinal and industrial solvent.The next thing I noticed is something mentioned in pretty much every review of this product: the size of the granules.  Simply put they're quite large.  Now I don't create skincare products but that seems kind of counter-intuitive to me in that one would think that the bigger the granules the rougher they would likely be on the skin.Even so I put a small amount in my hand and massaged it very very gently on my face.  I followed that procedure every three or four days over the course of several weeks.  On the plus side my face felt very smooth after each application. Well I should say that the parts that didn't break out in red bumps of varying sizes felt smooth.  I really liked that smoothness; in fact my face hadn't felt that soft in a long time and that's why I gave this two stars instead of one.The breakouts though started off on the not-good level and all too quickly reached terrible status.  Each time I'd break out I'd wait until the bumps decreased somewhat in size and number and my face calmed down and then I'd give the scrub another (exceedingly gentle) try and meet with the smooth skin/breakout combo all over again.  To be honest the fact that I continued with this experiment for as long as I did wasn't the smartest move I've ever made but I did so both because I tried telling myself that my skin just needed something of an adjustment period and because I so badly wanted to find a product that worked.  There came a point where I just had to admit defeat though.I am sincerely glad that this product works so well for so many people because I know how difficult it can be to find effective products that don't cause more problems for sensitive skin. I'm just a little sad that I couldn't count myself among those who met with success when using this scrub.  Now whether this didn't work for me because of the severity of my skin's sensitivity or because there is something unique in terms of my body chemistry cell turnover (or lack thereof) etc. I don't know.  All I can say is that I would caution anyone who has extremely problematic sensitive skin to give this product a lot of serious thought before using it. Beware If You Have Very Sensitive Skin,little bit
This facial scrub works well...it scrubs. My face did feel clean after I used it mainly because this is probably the roughest scrub I have used. My skin can take it; however despite my warnings my daughter with the delicate porcelain skin used it for about  seconds and then washed it off. She'll never use that again it was too rough.My main complaint against it is the smell. I love no perfume products; but would take perfume over something that smells like a kitchen cleaner. I really like simple products (usually) and I'll finish using this tube but I'll hold my breath. Fragrance free odor,Neutral
I'm not a regular exfoliater--my wife is the one with the medicine cabinet full of exotic facial products--but when my skin started to break out she recommended I try this Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub to give my face a good clean.  So I gave it a shot.It's nice. It feels nice scrubbing in.  There are grainy bits in here that take the old skin off and leave your skin fresh and shiny. (If you believe the packaging the grainy bits are made of rice!) I don't have very sensitive skin so I wasn't bothered in any way and I definitely felt cleaner after using this.The packaging claims that this scrub is dye and perfume free but there is a definite scent and it isn't a nice one. I've seen a few reviews describe it as windex-like and that is about it.  It's a strange clinical smell.  Not something I would associate with natural ingredients. But again if you look at the packaging you see that this facial scrub is far from all-natural. Lots of chemical products in the list.My wife loves this scrub and uses it every night before she goes to bed. I'm not that regimented but it is nice to have to use every once in awhile when I need it. Scrub a dub du,sensitive skin
I am not a fan of expensive cosmetics and I am not picky on face washes so keep this in mind for this review.This was a great natural feeling face wash. No artificial smell or perfume just it's own natural and very subdued smell. The best way to describe the smell? it kinda smells like the container color (if colors had smells). The clear gel washes the face without issue and without any side-effects leaving your face clean and refreshed.This typically costs more than the face washes from the big mass market brands you find at local stores (if you buy them when they are on sale or on special) but I think the difference definitely justifies the slightly higher prices. Having said that it is up to the individual to decide where to draw the line. Would you still get it if you can find face washes from Nivea or Gillette or the like or usable store brands for half the price? One third of the price? One fourth of the price? Personally I draw the line at half the price. Nice smooth refreshing face cleaning,Neutral
I've been using the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash gel and the rest of the Simple facial line with it. The whole line has no perfumes dyes or harsh irritants that can upset your skin. The facial wash contains no soap. Honestly I was kind of expecting it to be not very cleansing but I was wrong. It removes every trace of makeup which is kind of my test in a cleanser to be sure it's doing a good job of cleaning. It's non-drying and completely unscented. I like it and it works much better than some expensive brands that I have used. Removes All Traces of Makeup,Neutral
Although I don't like all of Simple's facial products this face wash gel gets my vote as something worth buying. It spreads well over my wet face with a hint of lather. After I rinse with warm water and dab my face dry my skin feels fresh and tight without dryness. It must contain some kind of mild astringent to create that effect. Because it doesn't have any perfumes or harsh ingredients my normally sensitive skin does not break out flake or itch. I love the clean feel that it leaves. No residue. No burn. Just smoothness.If there is a downside to this product it is a slight difficulty in washing the gel away without a washcloth. Because I use my hands to splash water it takes longer to rinse away than I'd like. It's something I happily endure however given the gel's overall effect.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann Makes My Face Feel Fresh and Clean,dry skin
I couldn't wait to try this on my dry winter skin. I normally use a bar soapOlay Ultra Moisture Soap with Shea Butter ( bars) because I love a lot of lather and feel like it really gets all the makeup off and cleans my face so I wanted to see how a wash gel would work. The Simple brand is wonderful! I followed the instructions and splashed my face with warm water used a dime-sized dollop of the gel and then massaged it into my entire face (even my eye area). It lathered up nicely and rinsed off easily without leaving my face with that tight dry feeling that is typical for me. Usually I have to rush right to the moisturizer and slather it on but when I use this I have a less pressing need to do that.The Simple line does not contain any dyes perfumes or irritants that can upset the skin so it just leaves behind a nice smooth clean. This product would be great for those with sensitive skin. Since my skin is dry that was the most important aspect for me -- that it cleaned well and didn't make that condition worse. I definitely will keep on using this and recommend it to others. It is unscented which may or may not matter to you. Great cleanser!,sensitive skin
After using the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel my skin actually felt cleaner and softer.  When I first tried it I used a small daub to check out the consistency and to see what it would do.  It actually lathered up and acted somewhat like a soap.  My skin isn't as sensitive and prone to outbreaks as some people's however I do like to stay away from using any harsh chemicals.  If you need a deeper cleaning you may wish to try theSimple Smoothing Facial Scrubinstead.First I used the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel then theSimple Soothing Facial Toner and then moisturized.  If you want to stay with the same product line theSimple Replenishing Rich Moisturizeris now an Add-on item.  There are several positive things about the Simple line that are very appealing to me especially the lack of harsh chemicals.~  Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel has vitamin B- which helps restore soften and smooth~  There is no soap in the formula.~  NO perfume NO dyes NO harsh chemicals or irritants.~  There are no animal derivatives in the formula.~  It has been tested by dermatologists.~  It's  Noncomedogenic (it doesn't clog the pores of the skin).~  It's hypoallergenic.INGREDIENTS:Water (Aqua Eau) Cocamidopropyl Betaine Propylene Glycol Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Panthenol Disodium EDTA Sodium HydroxmethylglycinateWHAT ARE THESE INGREDIENTS?Cocamidopropyl Betaine (Surfactant):  Ingredient that is added to cosmetic products to clean or remove dirt and oil from the skin.Propylene Glycol (Humectant):  Ingredient that attracts water to hydrate the skinHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (Viscosity Increasing Agent):  Ingredient used to make the product thicker.Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B):  Ingredient that helps restore soften and smooth skin.Disodium EDTA (Chelating Agent):  Substance that is added to cosmetic products to inactivate and to form complexes with metal ions which could affect the stability and/or appearance of cosmetics.Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate (Preservative):  Ingredient that helps to inhibit the development of micro-organisms. The Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin ...,sensitive skin
The ultimate cleanser for sensitive skin or those suffering from allergies incurred by perfumes.There is absolutely no scent to this product nor is there soap. The ingredients are:.water.cocamidopropyl Betaine (an organic compound derived from coconut oil).Propylene Glycol (alcohol commonly used in skin products).Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose ( a polymer. Used in everything from construction to opthalmology - make of this what you will.).Panthenol (vitamin B).Disodium EDTA (or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid has a wide range of uses in consumer products especially in processed foods cosmetics etc.).Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate (a chemical preservative commonly found in cosmetics which helps prevent bacterial or fungal growth.)So it does not lather up in big suds and the ingredient list is something the consumer will have to come to terms with since it is a lot of big chemists words. I personally have had no problems with this product and I have to attend to both sensitive skin and perfume allergies and it does not dry out my skin.I think I'll keep using it Really is simple,sensitive skin
Not long ago I visited my daughter and  year old granddaughter in the UK. Among the things that I noticed in their bathroom were some Simple skin care products so I was interested to see some of the Simple line available to test particularly since I had not long ago run out of the skincare products I have used for some time the ones that come in the pink box.  So let me tell you what I had to work with.  (It wasn't pretty!)I've noticed ever since menopause came my way that my face had become dryer and dryer to the point that it felt like an outing flannel nightgown and definitely showed my age.  Almost nothing has done the first thing to improve the situation - at least until last week.I've been using the following products for a week twice a day except for theSimple Smoothing Facial Scrub --  fl oz which I have been using every other day in the morning.Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel  Ounce (Pack of )Simple Soothing Facial Toner . Ounce (Pack of )Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer . OunceYou can just color me impressed!  I look years younger.  My face no longer feels like outing flannel but is soft & moist my wrinkles are much less apparent and my skin has a healthy glow I haven't seen in some time.I'm even more impressed by Simple's commitment to their customers.  All of their products are non-comedogenic (meaning that they won't clog your pores) and none of their products contain dyes harsh irritants or artificial perfumes (I have very bad reactions to those.)  Everything is hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested some have no scent at all and Simple provides full information about everything that they put into each product right on their website (Simpleskincare dot com) where you can also sign up to the Simple VIP program which includes a monthly newsletter coupons and other special offers.  You'll find lots of skincare advice there too.Better yet Simple is multi-generational.  I happened to be chatting with my granddaughter the night this arrived (she has the most gorgeous complexion!) so when she asked what I was up to I told her I was testing some skin care products from the Simple line.  OMG Gram!  I love that stuff! she exclaimed. OMG - I love that stuff too!Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel  Ounce (Pack of )is scent free.  It contains Vitamin B known to soften smooth and restore skin and does not contain soap.  A tiny dab half the size of a dime is sufficient to wash both your face and neck.Grandma's $. - There's a reason that Simple is the UK's # selling line of skin care products. I love what they've done for my skin and am delighted to see them on this side of the pond.  Highly recommended! Color Me Impressed!,Neutral
I'm currently using Neutrogena's face wash which leaves a tingling effect and smells nice but leaves my skin a tad dry so I was glad to give this one a try.Pros:) No perfumes dyes soap etc. Hypoallergenic. I'm happy to be using something mild for a change. I especially like the lack of a scent. I use so many products (soap shampoo toothpaste hair gel) that if all of them had scent I would smell like a walking fruit aisle.) Less drying on my skin than the Neutrogena. I still feel a little dryness but just a very very little. A side benefit that I have noticed is that even my hands are less dry when I use it than when I use soap.Cons:) A minor one but the hole that the gel comes out is too big. I only need a very small pea sized glob but the smallest size glob I get is -x what I need and I have to flick part of it off.) Does wash off easily. It sticks on my skin and takes forever to wash off.Summary: Mild scent free and hypoallergenic. Difficult to wash off. Simple...,Neutral

Overall I'm very happy with this product and am going to make it part of my usual face care regime. Good Cleanser,sensitive skin
This is my least favorite of the Simple products.  I still like the fact that it's dye and perfume free and it is gentle on sensitive skin but it doesn't seem to clean so well.  After using it on my face there's still a bit of residue leftover that is visible on either the cleansing wipes or the cotton I use to put on the toner.While I like the way my skin feels after using it I'm not confident that my skin is as clean as it could be.  After trying it for a while I returned to my usual cleanser.  I still use and enjoy the other Simple products however. Maybe a little too gentle?,sensitive skin
I have pretty sensitive skin and suffer from constant break outs. I have recently started using Proactive but sometimes run out between shipments.That's where this product comes in. When they say no perfume or scent they aren't kidding. There is absolutely no smell to it at all nothing. Thats important to someone who might be sensitive to those types of things.It does make me feel very refreshed and clean when using this wash. I like to use my deep cleaning brush with this as well as the facial scrub.The price is reasonable and the product seems effective. I may consider making a permanent switch if the results prove to be long lasting. Refreshing indeed,sensitive skin
I have super-sensitive skin which frequently breaks out when exposed to oils and perfumes and anything even mildly harsh really.  This is aggravated during the winter when the cold winds and dry air chaps my skin.So I was fairly apprehensive about trying this product but I really like the Wash Gel and Toner that Simple puts out.  The Wash Gel I found to be very gentle and basically unscented. And while the description says that you should create a small amount of lather the way I've been using it it has never lathered.  It has though removed all signs of makeup.  And it's left my face feeling cool and refreshed.  Really.  I'm not sure what's in the wash but my face felt cool.That said it did dry my face a tiny bit.  Now during the summer I would have no problem at all with this.  A tiny bit of drying would in fact be a nice feature.  But this winter (and at my age) I don't want any drying so I'm sticking toNoxzemauntil after the humidity levels rise again.I do recommend this.  It is very gentle and pleasant. This Will Be My Summer Wash,Neutral
I'm fortunate enough to not have overly-sensitive skin but like most people my skin gets pretty dry in the winter. Using any soap or soap-based product on my face is just asking for trouble; it would take multiple slatherings of lotion to get my face back to looking human... This gel being soap-free and lacking harsh perfumes & dyes seemed like a good match. My only concern was the scent but when I received the package & opened the tube I was relieved that it was a mild & fresh/clean scent not perfume-y or flowery. I'd order it again as long as the price is competitive. I like the scent no problems so-so cost,Neutral
I really like this facial wash gel; my face feels so clean and soft after using it.  It is very gentle and does not irritate my skin. The gel is thick so just use a small amount; it lathers up really well. I find myself rubbing my hands on my face after washing with it (which come to think of it may not be the greatest idea if my hands aren't clean).  I have tried other face washes and really like this gel and how my skin feels afterward.  It has no dyes artificial perfumes or harsh irritants and is good for even sensitive skin.I have ordered this product as a subscribe and save item which is a good deal.  Recommended!  :-) Leaves my face so soft,Neutral
Product Description lists  ingredients; only  are the same as the  ingredients listed on the package. I applied the product several times always with the same results: &#; minutes after application the skin under my eyes was extremely dry &#; as if I had washed with a harsh soap and not applied any cream. I found this product drying not hydrating or soothing. At $ per / ounce I expect more.A year ago I switched from more expensive eye creams to Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Smoothing Eye Cream. I find it soothing and hydrating softening the fine lines around my eyes. It contains cocoa butter Vitamin E peptides and retinol to soften skin and help prevent wrinkles. It's only negative is a slight fragrance; while pleasant I prefer to avoid dyes and artificial perfumes whenever possible especially in skin care products. That is why I decided to try the Simple Soothing Eye Balm. For now I will continue using Palmer's while searching for an eye cream that is as effective but without dyes or fragrance.I hope this review is helpful. When purchasing new products I read and consider Amazon's Customer Reviews. How this product received so many  and  star ratings is a mystery.

Before I get into my thoughts on this product let me first explain what compelled me to try this product from Simple. I've never really had to do anything to my eyelids - haven't used lotions creams serums. They've just been fine and since I tend to want to have a really easy regimen for my skin I've never bothered to add it into my regimen. But for the past several months my eyelids have gotten really dry and flaky. It varies but some days my eyelids would get so dry that they would literally hurt!I'd tried rubbing a little Jojoba oil and while it did help it never completely fixed the problem and my eyelids would get dry again. So I decided to give Simple's Revitalizing Eye Roll-On a try. I already use their facial washes and moisturizers and LOVE everything this brand stands for.And I am SO glad I gave this a try! It works amazingly well and exceeded my expectations - especially on how quickly it moisturized my eyelids and took away the flaky feel and texture. I use it in the morning and at night when I put on my moisturizer and the next day I could already tell a difference in my eyelids. While they were still a little flaky they weren't as bad and they didn't hurt any more. On the third or fourth day of using it the flakiness is totally gone and shows no sign of coming back - my eyelids are as smooth as ever! (Which is so nice -- it was a nightmare trying to apply eyeshadow on lids that were flaking!)All in all I give this Revitalizing Eye Roll-On two BIG thumbs up! As I mentioned above I love what the Simple brand is all about and so finding something to nurture my eyes that has good vitamins and natural products with no perfumes dyes or harsh irritants. The metal roller ball on the tip of it feels amazing and cools my skin instantly. I will admit I was a little hesitant to purchase this product at first because of the price but I've discovered that it is TOTALLY worth every penny you spend on it and I plan on repurchasing this item for years to come! I got awesome results from this!!,Neutral

this is very strong.  so if you like really strong perfume it's ok.  I love jasmine scent bu this is just too strong for me. Very strong scent,Neutral
If you like the smell of flowers you'll love this. I had already tried two other perfume oils by Auric blends and I did not like them. So I wasnt feeling very optimistic when I tried this on. I put some on and went to the store. While I was in line I could smell this sweet warm alluring smell. I almost leaned over and asked the cashier what perfume she was wearing when I realized that it was probably me smelling like thatlol. The other night I put on a dab to go to bed just so I could smell it before I went to bed. I've never smelled jasmine before so im not sure how this compares to actual jasmine but i've heard so many people rave about the smell and if this is it I can see why. It also reminds me of someone who just stepped out of the shower and their skin smells just like soap. I'm so glad i've finally found a perfume oil that I like. I love this,Neutral
I got this today and I can not open it. I have tried and tried. So there it sits. I had my BF try and he said WTHeck did they tighten it with. So I have to wait for him to get some pliers out of the Garage to open that little bottle of Perfume oil. Imagine not being able to open it. I hope it smells good. I hope it doesn't brake when we do get it open. I can't smell it,Neutral

Okay I've purchased several Al-Rehab (Crown Perfumes) but this is definitely NOT one I would ever purchase again. This particular fragrance carries a unpardonable attitude. I have a problem wearing unusually strong perfumed scents. For me it is like standing in a mile high pile of dead  flowers with a kick you in the gut unpleasant smell.....way too pungent for my senses. I hate to lose any money but because this is inexpensive and I have no other use for it I am tossing it into the trash. White Full Perfume Oil - Bleeck!,Neutral

This Al-Rehab attar a concentrated perfume oil in a roll-on bottle is a soft scent for women.  It's a floral fragrance with notes of soft rose amber and vanilla.  This is a lovely fragrance that any woman could wear.  You will fall in love with the rose note.  Remember that this is concentrated perfume so apply very lightly as the scent gets stronger as you warm up.  This strikes me as a day time scent.  It is so nice. A Scent Any Woman Could Wear,Neutral
I received this in the mail and so nice to see they take the time to put in in packing and its safely brought to me. It smells so soft and wonderful and lasts all day. I put another one of this Brand on yesterday and it lasted til even this am when my BF snuggle with me and said Gosh you smell soooooooo Good!!!! And trust me this Man loved it because he not often mentions my perfumes. So this is a Winner and I have to Praise this brand for its lasting affect and for the shipping that is above Par and the beautiful Box it is in. I plan of buying this Brand for ALL my Gifts this Year. Thank You Al-Rehab your really wonderful and I can count on you now! Beautiful,Neutral
This oil is absolutely lovely!  It smells kind of lemony-sugary to me.  It smells like Pink Sugar perfume and believe me it lasts ALL. DAY. LONG!!!!!  The scent is  gorgeous it makes a statement but it's not cloying.  It's very soft and pleasant.  It's the perfect summer fragrance and I will most definitely be ordering this again!! Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!! SIMPLY GORGEOUS SCENT,Neutral
I purchased this looking for 'halal' alternatives to perfume (alcohol free). I like vanilla/sweet/musk scents but not fruity or too sugary - example Victoria's Secret Heavenly. If you like any of those notes you'll love this! It's definitely vanilla. I don't get floral or fruit maybe a little musk but it's exactly like the name Soft. Still it manages to be distinctive long lasting and potent.. I did a tiny half roll on one wrist rubbed my wrist together and  hrs it hasn't faded. It's only warmed. Actually I can't stop smelling my own wrists!! I would say it's for all ages definitely feminine a more sensual grown up version of vanilla/sugar scents. For the price you can't go wrong ... you'll be glad you tried it! PERFECTLY Soft,Neutral
Am liking the Soft attar I ordered.  It also smells like Aquolina BLUE Sugar for Men!!!I added a little amber paste to make it more robust/Crown Perfumes make a fine line of attars with very reasonable pricing and shipping.I became a repeat customer after ordering my first attar from Crown! GREAT ATTAR!,Neutral
Very nice scent. Concentrated so you only need to use a teeny bit. Smells clean and fresh kind of soapy in the best sense. I would purchase again. Soft Perfume Oil,Neutral
I enjoy delicate fragrances more than anything else and I have fallen in love the Oil by Al-Rehab(Crown Perfumes).  I have a problem with most perfumes and prefer oils with a musky type scent or one that bestows a mellow fragrance.  &#;Soft&#; is a delicate fragrance.......just the right amount of sweetness without overpowering your senses. Precious Fragrance,Neutral
The first perfume oil I bought on amazon was vanilla by Auric blends...it did not smell the way vanilla should and I was disappointed because I LOVE vanilla. The first perfume oil I purchased from Crown Perfumes was Jasmin which is wonderful. So I thought I would take another chance and pick another perfume oil from this company. After reading the reviews and seeing the word vanilla I decided to try this one next. I'm in love. It's warm sweet(but not in a over the top way like some perfumes) and it definitely smells like vanilla. There are other notes in it which seem to enhance and compliment the vanilla but vanilla seems to be the top note(at least to my nose anyway). I want my whole body and my entire room to smell like this.I believe there's a spray version that i'll be getting to spray around my room. I hope it smells the same. If I could I would give this perfume  stars not just because of the smell but because of the description of the perfume notes at the bottom of the page. I highly recommend that the company put a description of thenotes for EVERY perfume oil(some of them don't have one). The description of the notes is what was made me decide to buy Soft(and pick out a few others to buy later). Vanilla Heaven,Neutral
This Al-Rehab attar a concentrated perfume oil in a roll-on bottle is described as a fresh feminine fragrance with delicate Taif Rose and citrus note in the top and a blend of jasmine precious oudh sandalwood and amber in its heart. It is the scent of a fresh morning breeze in a rose garden. Gentle soft scent of fresh rose petals with accents of lemongrass.This is one of my favorite Al-Rehab perfumes.  It is blended beautifully doesn't have too much oudh but just the perfect amount to pull all the notes together.  This is very feminine and very interesting and different for the Western woman.  Give it a try you will fall in love with it. A Must-Have for Women,Neutral
This perfume oil is a little nauseating to me. It is very strong and I had to wash my wrist several times to remove it from my skin. It was an inexpensive experiment but it didn't remotely smell like rose just musky and heavy cloying floral. I may add it to the mopping water and see if it is more tolerable when it's not on my skin. Cloying fragrance,Neutral
I consider this the best woman's attar to try if you have no experience.  It's my everyday go-to summertime perfume because it works so well in the heat.  Two other's I'd recommend Nebras very feminine and Bakhour a lovely and stronger Arabian perfume.  Al-Rehab makes wonderful perfume oils.  You can buy all three and with shipping you are under $ so have some fun.  Balkis smells a bit like incense.  And beware that these are concentrated perfume oils.  A little touch goes a long way.  A technique I use to apply is right after a shower I make a circle of the oil in the palm of my hand rub both hands together and then rub on your body wherever you like.  I also put some on my hand to mix with my hair gel I love doing that. If you are new to Arabian attars...,long way
I happened to order Balkis on a whim after reading the favorable reviews.  So glad I did.I immediately ordered  more scents based on their good reviews and am looking forward to trying them.Looks as if I am going to be a repeat customer.  Prices are very reasonable.  Crown Perfumers is definitely a winner!Highly recommend them for their uniqueness and quality. Should these fine attars be a bit floral or feminine you canalways add a drop of amber to make them more robust.  The possibilities are unlimited.  You will not be disappointed with thesefine attars. GREAT VALUE and GREAT SCENT!,Neutral
I used to make essential oils for perfumes and this smells very much like a simple rose mixture. It smells very much like roses with a very slight musky note. It doesn't quite have the sweetness of pure-rose perfume but it's VERY close. I really love this scent.I normally dab some on under my clothes  (one dot two if it's a hot day/i'm working out) and it has pretty strong staying power. I get compliments on it all the time. Would definitely recommend.Warning: A little goes a LONG way! Very rosy,long way
I was looking for a Rose smelling perfume that wouldn't set me back too much cost wise and this Roses perfume oil just came in the mail by Al-Rehab is pure Roses!!! I don't smell anything but the strong scent of roses and it is heavenly. What a delightful surprize. The package came quickly and I love these people!!!! I am so glad that I took a chance on a company I never heard of...Thank you so much!!!! The fact it is a roll on makes its application so much easier too!!! Thank you! Roses by Al-Rehab is Awesome is a roll on smells great and I will buy this regularly!!!!,Neutral
I bought this because roses always remind me of my late grandmother and I was really pleasantly surprised. It's a lot stronger rose smell than the Chloe perfume but it doesn't have that overbearing perfume presence to it. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to dilute it in some grapeseed oil so it's not so &#;floral shop the day before valentines day&#; and more &#;summer garden&#;. Really pretty,Neutral
I love these perfume oils by Al-Rehab and have been trying various fragrances by this company.  This particular fragrance is not my favorite.  Yes it reminds one of roses but for me it is just a bit much.  I will hang on to it and may try mixing it with another fragrance to see how it works for me. Roses Perfume Oil,Neutral
This rose perfume has a very strong and pungent smell. When I got this I opened up the box to find that the rollerball had leaked into its packaging the box and bottle covered with oily residue. However while airing out it made a nice air freshener. Part of the novelty is the pretty bottle with Arabic writing but the oiliness has made some of the metallic writing rub off the label. The rose smell is good and fresh and a little goes a long way; I've also noticed the fragrance has mellowed out the longer I've had it. It's nice but I've realized I'm just not that much of a floral person.B- for the fragrance F for the leaky bottle. Pure unadulterated floral,long way
This Al-Rehab attar (concentrated perfume oil) contains delicate sweet creamy citrus and floral notes with slight overlapping tones of musk.  This perfume could be worn anywhere because it is so delicate.  As with all Al-Rehab attars apply with a very light hand because this is concentrated perfume oil in a roll-on bottle.  The fragrance will get stronger as you warm up.  This can be worn alone or on top of a stronger scent to tone it down.  Very nice delicate perfume. Delicate Feminine Fragrance,Neutral
This is the rd perfume oil i've purchased from crown perfumes. The description of the notes are pretty accurate. Citrus flowery creamy. (Although I don't smell the creamy aspect as much as the citrus and the flowers). I've given the other two oils i've purchased  stars but this one get  because it doesn't maintain its strength the same way the other two (Jasmin and soft) does and I feel like I have to apply more to get it to linger. So what I do is roll it back and forth several inches below my wrist(on my forearm) so it doesn't wash off when I wash my hands I still apply it to my wrist as well though. I need to explain what I mean by it doesn't maintain it's strength. The other two oils I bought seem to develop and deepen as the time goes by and this one fades out a little. It still lingers but it doesn't develop and maintain its full strength...and I have to apply a little more to give it more staying power. I wonder if its because the top note is citrus and citrus (in its natural state) doesn't linger for a really long time. You know like when you peel a juicy orange and  for a second the smell is in the air but then the smell is gone? That's just my theory. But it smells wonderful(makes me think of spring) and its a light scent that I could easily see someone(myself included) wearing to work. I would love my whole body and room to smell like this.  It was a nice change from the other two perfume oils I've  purchased that are heavier deeper more mysterious and sensual (think date night) which I absolutely love but would be afraid to wear to work. Light citrus-y scent,long time
This one also arrived in a timely manner. The smell is sweet but tolerable. I'm not too keen on sweet smelling perfumes but this one is more flowery than foody kind of sweet. A little better,Neutral
Great price and it works. It can turn hair white/grey if too much is applied. But as other posters have said brushing through it will help. The smell isn't something I'd choose as a perfume rather powdery but not overwhelming or nasty. Nothing is perfect. I'll take smelling slightly of powder over having my head look like an oil slick. I would definitely buy again. Does what it claims.,Neutral
Granted it does the job decently especially considering the price. However the smell is nauseating like old lady perfume and lingers for a VERY long time. Even after I showered.  Buy this one instead:Suave Professionals Shampoo Spray BeautifulIt works just as well and smells MUCH better. :) This stuff stinks.,long time
I have used this product one time so far. As far as I can tell it works in that my hair doesn't look quite as oily. However I will never use it again because the product smells absolutely horrid!! The best way I can describe it is a mix of industrial strength cleaner and your grandmother's perfume. So while your hair may not appear oily you stink to high heavens which is trading one negative for another. I'll stick with the oily hair. The smell - holy moly!,Neutral
Very perfumey. Can't stand the smell Heavily scented,Neutral
This is such a lovely perfume from the container to the scent it's perfect. Can be used day or evening. I loved it and I will keep using this for a while =) Love it!!,Neutral
i bought this perfume for my daughter michele as i did for my other daughter elisa also for a passover gift.  i was in her house when she opened it and she sprayed her wrist with it.  it was a very pleasant smell. sweet scents #,Neutral
I found this at TJ Maxx .oz bottle for $ so I couldn't pass it up. I'm not normally a fan of fruity scents but this one is wearable. The top notes are a bit much but after a while it settles down nicely. This smells like a Victoria's Secret type perfume; a scent for someone young maybe even high school. I do not regret buying it but would not repurchase since it kind of smells like fruit juice :\  But did I mention the bottle is GORGEOUS!? Average scent,Neutral
I absolutely LOVE this scent and apparently so do males.  It's sweet and sexy but not heavy or overbearing.  I get compliments from males all the time that I &#;smell sooo good&#;.  I recently recommended to a friend and she got the same results.  She said even her husband who rarely gives her compliments made a comment about it.  Amazon saves me about $ on the .oz bottle as opposed to buying in the dept store and it lasts forever!  Definitely my favorite perfume right now! The Secret Sauce!,favorite perfume
I really like this perfume and I purchased it based on the reviews not knowing the actual scent. It's very nice. Smells like cherries and lime combined. It's lasting power ranges from three to four hours depending on how much you sprayed on yourself. It's light and fresh. It's an easy fragrance to wear everyday and is even nice for a night out to dinner (especially if you don't want to suffocate everybody around you). Fresh - Clean - Citrusy,Neutral
I love perfume and I saw this bottle I had never seen or heard of this one before for the sheer look of the bottle and the top pink and beautifully designed it looks great and it have a lovely sent. yes I would recommend this product to everyone. Looks so beauitful,Neutral
When I first smelled this fragrance I thought it was incredible. I still think it smells amazing but it does have somewhat of a cough syrup scent before it really settles into your skin. However in spite of that one little con it is a very pretty yummy fragrance. I am a bonafide perfume addict and know something good when I smell it. I do prefer sweeter scents over musky fragrances (especially during the warmer seasons) so I may be a little partial in this review due to that preference. But this really is a lovely perfume.Quick tip: Layering a scent like this with a sweet but mild body butter or lotion when you are fresh out of the shower helps the scent last longer. Spray your pulse points and it is guaranteed to last all day. Like it a lot but don't love it.,Neutral
Ok so even though I am in my early 's let me say that I love some hard to find old school beloved scents from the 's. Anyhow I smelled this one day and realized that the missed beloved Electric Youth perfume from Debbie Gibson has been discontinued for ages now I realized that this smells so similar OR that they took that original scent and recycled it to Justin's! So happy they did!! If you remember that sweet perfume from the s and can't find Electric Youth anywhere buy this perfume!!BTW: I find that his other newer perfume (The Key)is also very identical to Babyphat perfume in Golden Goddess. smells JUST like Debbie Gibson's Electric Youth Perfume!!,Neutral
I found a sample of this in a magazine and i loved it! I had to buy it! It smells fantastic! Even the bottle is gorgeous! To be honest i am not a Justin Bieber fan (don't hate me) but I love this perfume anyway. It is such a fantastic smell It is kinda fruity but intense and mysterious. Like it said SOMEDAY is the idea that we can change the worldmake our dreams come true and even be with that one person who means everything. Which is totally true!  And This is a great PerfumeGreat bottle and even a great quote. Lol this is awesome though i gotta admit it. Not a Justin Bieber Fan but this is a great perfume!,Neutral
My  yr old niece really wanted this perfume.. She loved the adorable bottle and charm it came with... But she sprayed it on and it's not for her! Way to strong and is a scent for a much older person.. Not a young lady! I also tried it and its not a pleasant smell :( ugh! This company however did ship and package great! A flop,Neutral
I got a sample of this through Sephora.com and at first I wasn't going to try it because most perfumes and colognes just don't do it for me.  On top of that I am not a Bieber fan and was actually getting annoyed at how much publicity he was getting.  But I tried it and my my... it smells great!  It reminds me of cotton candy!  And it's not too strong for summer use!For months I kept saying I really don't want to support him by buying his perfume but it smells so good! and I stood by this and continued to use the sample.  Then one day in my haste of rushing out the door the little vial slipped out of my hands as I was applying it and all but a few drops were lost.  Now I'm searching for the best deal... Not a fan of Bieber but definitely a fan of his perfume...,Neutral
I am a -year-old woman and I do NOT have Bieber Fever. However I received a free sample of this perfume and was stunned by the fact that I did not detest it! In fact it wasn't half bad. Not my taste of course...a bit too youthful and fruity for me. But the fragrance didn't make me want to vomit and it had pretty good staying power. If you like it buy it! Not bad,Neutral
Normally I only use all natural organic products but I was on a mission to find a body lotion that was light enough for summer heavy enough to moisturize my (tanned within in an inch of its life) skin smelled good (but not heavy or over powering) and was inexpensive.I found most of the qualities in this product! It's perfect for summer as it hydrates my dry skin without being greasy and it smells so amazing - yet it doesn't over power my perfume. Even the price is reasonable considering how little of this you need.I really love this lotion but am turned off by the long list of chemicals it contains. I'll probably only purchase it on occasion as I can't use it everyday do to the ingredients. Impressive,dry skin
I always try to avoid perfumes and dyes whenever I can so when I saw that there was a dye-free blender I knew I had to get it. Works just like the original yes it shows make-up easier but it still washes clean. I also LOVE the solid soap. The liquid is fine but this saves a ton of space on my counter and I can travel with it. I also feel I use less of it. Love it just for the solid soap alone,Neutral
I like Wen very much and for me this scent is the best.  Unlike others I smell predominately vanilla and don't think it smells at all like a peppermint patty.  I have tried most of the Wen cleansing conditioners and have not experienced hair loss burning itchy scalp or greasy hair.  I have fine short naturally curly dyed hair and all the Wen I've tried works well with my hair.  This is my favorite scent.  I do not use as many pumps as recommended and add water as directed tospread it through my hair.  I leave it on while I shower rinse and style my hair as usual. Everyone has their preference of hair products and scents.  I don't find that the scent interferes with my body lotion and/or perfume. Wonderful scent!,Neutral
I first used this with the Lemongrass Shampoo which used together gave me an itchy scalp and a perfumey smell plus buildup.  So then I tried using the conditioner with a different brand shampoo which made this conditioner smell better.  With the different shampoo the conditioner did a fair job of conditioning no itch or buildup and it wasn't bad.  Left my hair feeling normal. Average,Neutral
I like Caress In general as I find regular soap too drying. For years I've used the original scent in the pale-peach box which has a very traditional flowery soap scent. I like that scent but Endless Kiss is very different and a nice change of pace. It isn't ultra-sweet but the vanilla and sandalwood give it a deep rich aroma that reminds me of With Love by Hillary Duff and Japanese Cherry Blossom from BBW. Very pleasant. The fragrance does not linger on the skin after showering the way the original scent does but I'm fine with that because I don't like my soap to clash with my perfume. A nice change of pace from the usual soapy fragrance,Neutral
This a very large bottle of body wash when you consider the price. The typical bottle of body wash you get from places like Bath and Body works are  oz. This one is  oz over twice as much. The texture is definitely thicker than typical runny body wash. It has a texture more like cake frosting and because it's white it even looks a little like frosting. But it's not so thick that it is hard to use. It comes out of the bottle easily and lathers up into a very rich texture.While I can't say for certain if my skin is getting any toner from the wash I will say I am surprised at how much I like how it makes my skin feel. Normally I pay a lot for very fragrant body washes from specialty stores. I didn't realize how much my other washes dried out my skin until I started using this Dove Creme Body Wash. My skin feels soft and hydrated instead of dry and perfumey. I've put my other soaps away for now and and am instead enjoying how great this wash makes my skin feel. Lathers very well. A little goes a long way,long way
I really like this body wash! So much that when I run out I'll gladly buy it. The scent is extremely mild. It's not perfume-like at all. It washes off easily. There are some body washes that I've used that I have to really work at getting it all washed off. I don't have that problem with this body wash. It's very mild all around.As far as toning.....I'm not sure. I immediately felt a difference in the way my skin felt after the very first use. Maybe a more moisturized feeling. I can't say my skin feels more toned though. I did just have a baby  weeks ago so take that into consideration! It never claimed to work miracles. ;)**After reading some of the other reviews about allergic reactions I'm starting to re-think this body wash. I've used it about  / weeks now and in that time I've got dry-like patches on my body. My husband said it seemed more like a skin reaction to something as opposed to dry skin. I haven't been able to figure out what could be causing it but now I'm wondering if it's this body wash! I'm not taking off any stars at this point since I still don't know for sure what is causing it. I thought I would mention it in case anyone else gets similar results. Great Body Wash!,dry skin
Winter and showers play havoc on our skin. Shower gels are great and leave us smelling good but our skin may lack tone and lustre. Dove Creme Boddy Wash Visible Care Toning leaves the skin hydrated and soft yet not greasy. if you miss the youthful feel from your skin this prodcut will help in returning it. If you are a person that does not like a lot of perfume this product has a more natural un-obtrusive smell. Silky soft!,Neutral
Dove Creme Body Wash is the thickest body wash I have ever used.  Because it is so thick I don't have to use a lot of it.  It lathers well has a light scent (not perfume-y) & doesn't dry out my skin.The Dove body wash comes in an  ounce bottle which is larger than many body wash containers. Because of its size & the fact that you don't need to use a lot of it I expect one bottle to last almost twice as long as my regular body wash.The best thing about Dove body wash however is the fact that it is gentle and doesn't dry out my skin.  If you don't have dry skin you may be able to get away with no having to use a moisturizer.  I have dry skin so I still use a moisturizer.I cannot speak to the toning claim.  The pictures seem to show dry skin as a before picture & moisturized skin as the after picture.  If that is what they mean by toned then yes Dove body wash does help with keeping normal skin moisturized. Thick Body Wash Moisturizes & Cleans. Not Sure About Toning Claim,dry skin
There are a lot of bodywashes that claim to leave your skin moisturized after showering and I have yet to find one that lives up to its promise.  However this one is the best one I have found.  In the winter I have VERY dry skin.  After using this in the shower I notice that my skin is considerably less dry without using lotion.  It is still dry but there is a BIG difference in using this as opposed to usingSoftsoap Coconut Scrub Bodywash -Ounce Bottles (Pack of ) my usual bodywash.The Dove bodywash has a light clean smell that isn't overpowering and doesn't linger.  I work in an office where we aren't supposed to wear perfume so this works well because it doesn't leave behind a perfume smell.  It lathers well washes away clean and doesn't leave a greasy residue on me or my shower.  It doesn't feel oily it just feels light and creamy.  I will be using this from now on.  I like it better than the Softsoap bodywash I have been using for years. Leaves my skin moisturized,dry skin
I really like this body wash I love dove products we usually stick to dove sensitive body wash. This was a nice change I haven't noticed any toning effects but is super thick & creamy I really like it.  It has a definite perfume-y smell like something you would buy at the beauty counter at dept store which is a plus for me but major negative for my husband. Very creamy body wash!,Neutral
Dove Creme Body wash is thick thicker than lotion and goes on smooth. It feels like butter and leaves your skin feeling moisturized right away. I found that this has not left a film in my shower which i really appreciate. The wash is consistent. Some other washes I have used have been watery chunky or grainy and this was perfectly buttery smooth every single time. The container is large and about  quarter size dollops are all it takes to cleanse the entire body. This will last a long time. The scent is light and fresh. It doesn't stay with you for very long after your shower so it will not compete with your perfumes. Overall this is the best body wash I have used in years. My new GO TO body wash,long time
As a guy I never gave the Dove brand a chance until I took a medication that dried out my skin. My doctor recommended it and ever since I've been hooked. What makes it great is that it leaves the skin clean without drying it out and does not include any perfumes that might irritate the skin. The Visible Care Toning Dove body wash is the liquid equivalent of the classic soap. There is no lingering fragrance with the only scent being similar to an unscented lotion. This scent is only present during use since it washes off so cleanly.The texture of this body wash is just like lotion.  It is a bit silkier than the Sensitive Skin variety but still lathers and cleans well.  Both are great and neither irritates me.  Overall these are the best body washes I have used and a little better than the Dove+ line. Soft Skin,sensitive skin
I am not a heavy user of skin care products to say the least.  My skin care routine involved cheap soap and water.  But lately as age creeps up on me I've been noticing my skin needing something more.  It's been dry sometimes blotchy getting more wrinkly---and when I got a chance to try this group of products I was eager to.  Not that I thought they'd make any difference but I kind of wanted to prove to myself that nothing would.Well color me hugely surprised.  THEY WORK.  I can honestly see a quite noticable difference all over after a few weeks of faithful use.  My skin is softer shows less lines just feels and looks better overall.  The most amazing thing is the Eye Never cream.  My eyes have ALWAYS been wrinkly and a bit baggy under them.  I mean back to childhood.  After just a few uses I saw something truly that blew me away.  The wrinkles under my eyes were pretty much GONE.  I don't know how it works but it works.  I asked my husband to look at my eyes without telling him why and he immediately noticed too.The products come in a nice metal case with a mirror.  They are small tubes but if you read the instructions you need to use very little of each.  They have no perfumes I can smell and they did not irritate my skin at all.I never thought such words would come out of my mouth (or get typed by me) but this expensive product just might be worth it.  I do think I'll be re-buying the Eye Never anyway.  I could possibly be a believer now. Could not have been more skeptical could not have been more pleasantly surprised,Neutral
In just one use of each of the five products in this kit I can honestly say that already my skin feels tighter and smoother.  I think the kit is an excellent way to sample these products as part of a daily beauty routine.  The products all feel very smooth and silky on the skin leaving no greasy residue.  Similarly there seems to be little to no scent to these products which makes me happy as artificial perfumes irritate my skin.Is this kit pricey?  Yes these are pricey luxury level beauty products; the full size product is pricey so it seems to reason that a sample kit is not going to be cheap.  This kit is probably not right for someone who is content with drugstore type skin care products (and I am not indicating there is anything wrong with drugstore skin care products I use many).  But for someone who has the budget or the desire to use high end luxury beauty products this kit is an excellent way to sample new products.I thought the packaging was lovely.  I like the clutch as a nice way to keep the products neat and organized.  This can easily be thrown into luggage or an overnight bag and since it has a mirror applying these (and other) products is simple.  I also like that you can purchase refills of the small size tubes.All in all for those in the market for luxurious beauty products I think this is a great kit that will allow you to try different products and determine if it is worth it to you to purchase the full size items. Luxurious,Neutral
I'm always up for trying new skin care products so was happy to have a chance to give the vbeaut&eacute; Buying Time Everyday Cr&egrave;me a whirl. I have to admit that I hadn't noticed the price tag until after a couple of trial days - I would have expected gold flakes or something at those price levels! Initial impressions:The outside packaging is minimal although the small white print on the dark purple box made for difficult reading for older folks with small-print challenged eyes. I had to put on the readers as well as holding the box under a bright light to manage reading it at all but since I don't understand half of what the ingredients are why I bothered...The jar itself is a dark purple with an odd triangle shape (being artsy and stylish I assume). It opened easily enough and I was happy to find it unscented since heavily perfumed products make me ill. The cream is on the thick-ish side although I didn't find it greasy feeling and went on smoothly but it is heavy enough that you can't put makeup immediately over it - you need to wait a good five minutes for it to sink in.I've been using it for several days now and the first two my cheeks were a bit reddish and I also had a few too many pimples (at my age I shouldn't have many at all) but that's cleared up after a couple more days. I haven't noticed any improvement one way or the other as far as younger looking skin but I'll report back if I see anything significant after a longer period of time. As it is this seems to work as well as the much lower priced products I normally use. This isn't a bad cream by any means but IMHO it isn't a great one either particularly not at the listed price. YMMV. Works about as well as the lower priced moisturizers,Neutral
This cream is light enough to be used during the day and offers significant benefits. It moisturizes and smooths away small imperfections of the facial skin. It leaves the skin feeling peachy-smooth and well-moisturized.I liked this cream a lot and would have given it  stars if it weren't for one thing: this creme has a chemical odor that is quite perceptible. A cream should either have a pleasant smell or ideally no smell at all. For all its strengths this cream loses to its competitors in terms of its odor. I don't really feel like smelling like a chemical factory for almost an hour after applying the product. And it isn't that I have an especially acute sense of smell that nobody else has. I asked other people and everybody agreed that the odor was perceptible. When this chemical odor mixes with my perfume the result is not fantastic. This is why I only used it at night.Other than this issue (that I hope will soon be fixed) this is a very impressive product. And the packaging is beautiful. Mostly good,Neutral
Ever since I broke up with Clinique I have been using a lot of different things.  I can't believe all of the stuff I missed.  Admittedly I was a little suspicious of this cr&egrave;me when I first saw it.  It had a clever Eye Never on the jar the jar is a pretty shiny purple and is shaped like a rounded triangle.  I have to admit feeling a little groan because that kind of bottle always has something with funny smells inside of it that makes my skin turn pink and bumpy.  But this was not true at all.  It is a much better cr&egrave;me that I ever would have guessed.This cr&egrave;me is pretty thick surprisingly so.  Most of the eye cr&egrave;mes I have ever used are as light as air.  I have always been taught to put the thinnest lightest cr&egrave;mes on the bottom layer and then work outward.  It bothered me at first but not for long.This is a thick cr&egrave;me that doesn't have any perfumey smell to it.  There really isn't any smell which is really nice.The only problem that I encountered is rubbing my eyes.  For some reason this cr&egrave;me feels really sharp and burns a little.My problem isn't really wrinkles - before I used it I had to squinch my eyes to make wrinkles and I still do.  My problem is baggy eyes from years of not sleeping more than  or  hours a night.  It didn't really make any difference in that problem but my skin was and is very well moisturized.I will definitely continue using this. Eye never! Yes I did.,Neutral
I didn't find this hydrating at all but what really disturbed me was the scent. The description states it is light natural and not flowery. The lavender scent was so strong I had to wash the lotion off. They say it is just essential oils but it smelled as strong as synthetic perfumes often do. I had to return it. Not for me,Neutral
Having been thrilled with NaturOli shampoo  I thought I'd give the lotion a try.  I have been leery about the products I put on my skin and it's hard to find something that's completely natural and safe!  This lotion soaks into the skin very quickly leaving the skin feeling soft and hydrated  and it also smells great too.  Not perfume-ey or like your grandmother.  Just a light natural smell.  Great product!  Wish it came in a larger bottle! Love the Lotion!,great product
My favorite things about this are the mesh pockets and the material. I love that you can put little things in the pockets and see them for easy access. Also I tend to rub powder off of my brushes onto my apron (bad I know) so I love that this fabric is easy to wash! Still suggest hand-washing though to keep any laundry soap perfumes from getting onto your brushes don't want any chemicals on clients! Pretty stellar,Neutral
I can't stand the smell of this product. It smells like rotting flower perfume. I only used it once and threw it away. Disgusting Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine Serum,Neutral
I might like this but it's hard to get past the over perfumed product that youput on your hair after you get out of the shower as a leave in...just before youblow dry. I like the scent if it wasa lot milder but it's to overpowering as is.With three bottles it's going to be a long time before I see the end of it. I'll belooking to share with someone else as I don't see my using it. Now afraid to try theserum in the same line too.First time use I ended up washing my hair to get it out instead of blow drying it.Tried it a second time and just added very little to wet hair and blow dried it.The smell seemed to become lighter after blow drying but still too much for mynose. I do not blow dry my hair every time as it's fragile and hoped this wouldhelp with the heat damage. However even with the real light application I thinkit had some hope in that department. But getting into the enclosed space of a carjust after drying hair for a  hour drive...I found it was still too strong.PS: To be fair I am quite sensitive to fragrances and use no scent products likelaundry soap & softeners. If a no scent product is available that I use I go for it.So Suave...please make this product in a no fragrance version and I'd be glad togive it another trial. I'm not alone there are a lot of people who avoid prefumecounters and soap aisles for this very reason not to mention stop buying magazinesthat come with those horrid perfumed inserts. I like the shampoo & regular conditioner in line.,long time
The roller bottle is a perfect way to experience a high-end fragrance at an affordable price. It's quality perfume so a little dab lasts a long time. I love the sweet spicy fragrance. Love this fragrance,long time
I am very fair complected heck I could make Snow White look tropical. Usually nothing under SPF  can protect me from burning. I burn and it peels and then I'm back to being pale again. I hung out at the pool this summer and generally that means I am gonna get fried. But using this sunscreen at a mere SPF  actually did the job! As long as I made sure I was thoroughly covered I stayed blindingly white. Even after swimming. I was committed to reapplying if I was going to stay out for more than an hour and a half or so.The lotion was not greasy nor too thick. And I never noticed a perfumery sunscreen smell too which was nice if your not into that. My Pale Pale Flesh is still Pale!,Neutral
Every time my family goes to the Lake Erie resort of Cedar Point it seems at least one of us comes home with some degree of sunburn no matter how well prepared for the sun we thought we were.  For this trip we all applied the Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Sunscreen and despite lots of sun exposure at both the lakes and while waiting for rides we all came home burn free.This Hawaiian tropic sunscreen has a light clean scent (faintly of coconuts) that should not bother even the most perfume phobic person.  It feels great going on and did not need to be reapplied after the initial application in the morning.  I will definitely be buying this sunscreen in the summers to come. Smells Great And Provides Good Protection From The Sun,Neutral
I want three things from my sunblock.  First it needs to provide durable and effective blocking of UV rays.  This product does that well and seems pretty durable through sweating and water events.  Second I don't want it to be slimy sticky or greasy.  Again this product does it well.  It seems to just flow into your skin and seems to moisturize while doing its job.  Finally I'd like it to smell but not be perfume like.  This has what seems like a tropical island scent which is really pleasant.  I love it. Silky non-greasy sun block,Neutral
I have been a fan of this brand for years but this product was new to me and after two weeks of use I had to take a moment to review this wonderful sunscreen. The tube is rather small but the lotion itself is very creamy and very silky and it spreads on skin like butter so you don't need a whole lot unless you will be spending a whole day at the beach in which case reapplying will be necessary. I have used this when I went swimming and spend some time outside and I use it daily to cover my d&eacute;colletage and arms since this simmer as been very hot and sunny and I see no skin burns and no redness at the end of the day.  I'm pretty pale so my skin will turn pink before it even turns golden and this has been a real life saver so far. It feels like a very rich lotion with hydrating oils in it rather than a traditional pasty lotion that can leave white smears on the skin. SPF  is just right as well not too high and not too low. The ribbons of lotion and oil are very nice as it forms into a great consistency that is very easy to use all over and it even tough its very moisturizing it doesn't make my skin feel greasy at all.The scent is sublime; it makes me feel like I'm floating on a hammock in Tahiti. Very delicate coconut and sunny beach smell it actually makes for a great perfume that transforms a hot day into an exotic experience. The feeling of sand between my toes is in my head anytime I get a whiff of this I would wear it for scent alone and consider the SPF a bonus haha.  Tropic Silk is a fantastic product that nourishes and instantly relaxes; I will definitely get another tube once this runs out.- Kasia S. Gorgeous scent and great protection,Neutral
Having fair skin that burns easily pretty much ensures that sunscreen is my best friend come sunny weather.  I have made peace with the fact that I am tanning impaired but that doesn't mean that I actually like wearing sunscreen.  I often find that it leaves my skin feeling sticky or doesn't rub in easily leaving me looking like Caspar the friendly ghost.  That was not a problem with this product.  This lightweight formula blends in completely similar to any body lotion.  There is absolutely no sticky/tacky residue - skin feels soft and smooth; you can't even tell that you're wearing anything.  Despite being a moisturizing formula I found (to my surprise) that I could even use it on my face without aggravating my combination/oily skin.  So it's perfect right?  Not quite...It doesn't have that tropical coconut smell that I usually associate with sunscreen but it does have a distinct fragrance almost like wearing perfume.  I don't find it unpleasant but I don't love it either.  If you like to wear perfume this will definitely compete with it and if you are sensitive to fragrance I wouldn't recommend this.Fragrance issue aside the product does perform quite well.  Despite the fact that I was sweating like mad after a long bike ride the sunscreen did not run or sting my eyes.  SPF  blocks about % of UVB rays but should be reapplied frequently to ensure adequate coverage.One last thing.  Unless you've been living in a cave for the past few years (in which case who needs sunscreen?) you're probably aware that some of the chemicals used in sunscreens are coming under scrutiny.  Instead of just sitting there on the surface of our skin the little buggers can actually be absorbed into our system.  The three main UVA/UVB blocking ingredients in this product (most sunscreens actually) are:-Avobenzone-Octocrylene-OxybenzoneYou may want to Google these to see if any of the data on them causes you any concern. Feels great on my skin but I'm not wild about the strong fragrance...,Neutral
The consistency and performance of Silk Hydration SPF Sunscreen Lotion is very nice. It's non-greasy non-drying moisturizing and glides on easily with a matte finish. Make up goes on easily without having the sunscreen haze distorting the coloration: it's great with or without makeup!The lingering summery fragrance of cocoa butter may not fare very well this winter OR it may be just the perk me up reminder of the upcoming summer when an SPF is required. It just might be my year-round totem of positive thinking to retire on some sunnytropical island - I can dream :)All kidding aside this is a good hydrating SPF sunscreen lotion I would buy and incorporate in my summer skincare routine BUT I prefer UNSCENTED lotions creams etc that won't clash with my perfume. Non-Greasy Non-Drying Moisturizing Summery...,Neutral
This is very moisturizing and smells good and goes on like a lotion - non-greasy.  I just wish it didn't smell like a perfume.  It also has helped keep the sun from burning me on my arms which tends to be where I have the problems. Good product!,Neutral
When the typical sunscreen smell and feel leaves you queasy and greasy it's not an enjoyable activity to have to spread the stuff on for a trip out in the sun.  Having something like this makes it a whole lot better!  The Hawaiian Tropic Silk Sunscreen has a mild and pleasant aroma (though it may not appeal to all individuals).  I'm generally sensitive to heavy perfumes in lotions but this did not bother me or give me a headache.  The overall texture is smooth and comfortable going on easily and not leaving me feeling like I'm wearing a greasy shell.It seems to do the job just fine--I've been out in the sun with no burns to show for it.  Perhaps the only down side to my mind is that the consistency of the lotion means I usually wind up using more of it to cover--thus running out of the lotion sooner.  That may just be me.  Seems like a perfectly decent well working sunscreen that doesn't have the strong sunscreen odor.^_^ Shanshad Sunny Days are Here Again!,Neutral
TEXTURE. This is Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration's true claim to fame.  The texture is well above average. I have been unsuccessfully searching for a sunscreen that is not at all greasy or oily. Hit the mark with this one which is more of a luxurious creamy lotion. Very pleasant when applied and I forget about it once it dries. I have several other sunscreens (now sitting on the shelf) all of which have a greasy or slimy feel and I much prefer this. No stickiness is a major quality. It really moisturized my extremely dry skin too.FRAGRANCE.  Some other reviewers comment on the fragrance being strongly coconut.  I don't agree with them but smell is an almost entirely subjective component.  I love Hawaiian Tropic products partly due to their wonderful coconut fragrance. Maybe not in the office but love them when I'm outside. I hate perfumes and colognes in general. But I don't think this sunscreen has a strong coconut fragrance.  Someone else mentioned tutti frutti and still another called it pina colada.  Perhaps those descriptions are closer than straight coconut.  For my own preferences I wish the coconut fragrance were stronger; maybe it would better mask the slight chemical smell.ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. Avobenzone % Octocrylene % and Oxybenzone %. Sometimes my skin has protested sunscreens that contain oxybenzone but not this time. The Neutrogena Wet Skin that contains it caused me to instantly develop itchy welts.  For some reason this sunscreen doesn't cause a reaction on my skin.  I have read unpleasant things about oxybenzone and have also read that the criticisms are junk science.  Doesn't look like that debate will be resolved soon.  I am going to rely upon the scientists who report that it has been used for two decades without any harm to humans ever being shown.SPF .  I like spf .  Anything less doesn't provide my fair skin enough protection for the many hours I stay in the sun.  The protection in this sunscreen is broad spectrum which includes both UVA and UVB which is essential. The instructions say to reapply every  hours.  Some reviewers have done that and still experienced sunburn.  I have gone more than two hours between applications and haven't had the slightest bit of sunburn although my skin is extremely fair and fragile.  If you get wet I think you need to reapply.  But if you are in the sun and still dry the spf  seems absolutely accurate.SHAKE WELL?  The instructions on the Amazon listing say to shake well.  I don't see what good that would do given the relatively thick formulation and the hydrating ribbons in the container.  After a few uses there is enough empty space in the container to allow some mixing so that the shake well instruction seems to have more relevance.  But the sunscreen works even when the hydrating ribbons are still separate in the container.  The lotion that is dispensed through the small opening (which is conveniently located at the bottom of the container) seems to come out fairly mixed whether I shake or not. Great texture but too much fragrance for me,dry skin
I was able to try the Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Sunscreen Lotion when it was included in an influenster voxbox. I've learned that brown skin needs sun protection too. Although it is a white cream the Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration sunscreen blends into my brown skin without a pasty film. It has a nice fragrance. Matter of fact when I took my car to be serviced the mechanic asked whatdelicious smelling perfume was I wearing?! The sunscreen is very moisturizing and eliminated the need for me to apply lotion. (There are hydrating ribbons of moisture built in! I really enjoyed the glow it gave my face. I have already purchased some locally to add to my makeup routine.HAWAIIAN Tropic Silk Hydration SPF  Sunscreen Lotion  Fluid Ounce Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration SPF  Sunscreen Lotion,Neutral
This is actually a very nice sunscreen product. It is not sticky or greasy at all and it does a good job of preventing sunburn while keeping my skin hydrated.BUT - and this is a big but - the scent is way too strong for me. Whenever I slather it on I feel as if I'm trapped in an elevator with one of those women who wears so much perfume that no one can breathe... only that woman is me!It is advertised as having a light scent which makes me curious to know what the company thinks is a heavy scent. Plus the scent is fruity/floral/coconut which is fine for rum-based tropical drinks but not for head-to-toe sunscreen.If Hawaiian Tropic decides to make an unscented version I'll be all over it. I love everything else about it but the scent is just not my cup of tea. The scent is way too strong,Neutral
I am very light skinned and always need sunscreen. I found this to dispense easily and protect as a SPF  sundcreen should. It has a slightly more perfumed smell than many sunscreens but I did not find it overpowering.The cooling sensation is real and was refreshing for a few minutes on a hot day.Overall a good product. EASY TO USE AND EFFECTIVE,Neutral
Absolutely the best spray on sunscreen I've ever used.  I love the smell it's very fresh (don't worry it's not like a perfume that would attract bugs). It really does go on dry and doesn't need to be rubbed in.  Sprays evenly and it seems to last about  hours on dry land but if you go into water play it safe and reapply every hour. great value best spray on out there,Neutral
Living in the southwest desert sunscreen is a must!  With kids who don't like taking the time to put on sunscreen lotion the spray is a great convenience and less of a mess.  It still needs to be rubbed in like lotion but is quicker to put on.  The best thing about the product is it's ease of use.As other reviewers have mentioned the smell is strong and doesn't invoke thoughts of sun and sand the way many sunscreens do.  Instead of the coconut oil smell that reminds me of the beach it's more of a smell that reminds me of cheap perfume or insect repellent. Everyone in the family noticed it and didn't care for it.  If it's going to be scented I'd opt for something other than this.  The coolzone affect wasn't very noticeable to the point that if you didn't know it was there you wouldn't notice it.Currently the product is listed for $. which is too much IMO.  You are paying for the convenience but you could get a similar product for less at one of the big box stores.Overall if you want the ease of use and don't mind the strong odor it's a good product just currently overpriced.  For me I'd go for a different spray something cheaper and without the strong odor. Easy to Use,Neutral
Overall Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray works rather well to block the sun's rays. It does indeed go on with a cooling refreshing feel although the scent may be bothersome to you if you are allergic to scents. (Try looking for something hypoallergenic if you are allergic to scents or if you simply want a product without a scent.) For me the scent while certainly not *too* strong is just OK because it smells a little bit like a lady's perfume; so I didn't really like that.When I tried this a few times I found out that while this protected me from the sun's rays it does need to be rubbed on in spots because it never gets fully everywhere I want it for example on parts of my face like my cheeks and the back of my neck. The continuous spray probably won't be sufficient sunscreen for most people. I don't like it on my hair obviously; and don't even try to spray this on your face spray it on your hands and gently apply it to your face skipping the areas immediately around your eyes nostrils and mouth.Another reviewer notes that the twisting cap prevents any spray from leaking out--and I agree! Good point.Overall this is a good product that is possibly better for women because of the scent although admittedly the scent is not that strong. This also works well as a supplement to other similar sunblock products by Banana Boat including Banana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen Lotion SPF . very good with one or two possible drawbacks,little bit
I use sunscreen anytime I think I will be outdoors for a length of time because I worry about skin cancer and premature aging. Putting on lotion sunscreen can be a bit of a chore because it can be messy and it is hard to rub in on places like your back. This spray on sunscreen is great because it doesn't need to be rubbed in and you can get to those hard to reach areas.The spray has a cooling sensation which is nice for those times at the pool or during a workout when you need to re-apply but it is hot outside. The sensation is only temporary but it is less stifling than a heavy lotion.I imagine that kids would enjoy using this sunscreen over a lotion because it is more fun.The only downside is the smell which reminds me of Pine Sol or some kind of cleaning product. Fun Effective But This Won't Be Inspiring Any Perfume Companies,Neutral
This spray-on sunscreen has a sickly sweet perfume smell. Not very pleasant. Luckily that dissipates after a few minutes. The real problem is that it's billed as no-rub sunscreen but unless you rub you're not going to be sure that you've actually covered the whole area. I guess this isn't Banana Boat's fault -- spray sunscreens are much harder to apply consistently than lotions -- but advertising it as no-rub is misleading.  It's also difficult to know exactly how much to use and if you've sprayed enough. You end up probably spraying more than you need to ensure you are entirely covered. Oh and I didn't much care for the cooling sensation. Felt more tingly than cool.I'm going to stick with my tried-and-true Neutrogena Ultra Sheer. It takes longer to apply but it's fantastic and I'm never wondering if I'm protected or not. Fine but relatively expensive and you have to rub it in,Neutral
Smells nice not perfumed. As a bubble bath it makes the water silky leaves skin soft and not icky. As a shampoo it's not bad. As a shower gel it's dandy.I'll try other 'flavors' soon. Nice,Neutral

And in a good way.. the smell is lovely not too perfume-y but also not too one note but what i enjoyed about this product was how nice it felt on my hair and scalp. It was not only nourishing but it also cleansed my head and it's very hard to find companies that actually do what they say. will definitely recommend this to anyone who likes cowashing or prefers the curly method of hair style. Definitely different..,Neutral
It's hard for me to find a perfume I like. There are only  fragrances as of right now I enjoy enough I could wear every day and this is one of them. The other is Pure Poison By Christian Dior. Angel is the exact opposite of my other all time favorite it's light and delicate. It's my favorite summertime fragrance since it's not heavy or overpowering. It's made from sparkling plum sheer violet and amber.The bottle is stunning. Very large (even more so than I though it would be) it seems to last forever. I have been wearing this perfume almost every day for  months and I've barely gone though a small portion of it. It's a beautiful heavy glass bottle with large opaque wings wings on the back of it. The spritzer works perfectly and dispenses just the right amount. The whole perfume bottle itself looks beautiful and extremely unique.Smells amazing and lasts forever this perfume is one of my all time favorites! Sparkling plum sheer violet and amber,Neutral
This perfume smells amazing! You've got to try it I think this will be one of my favorite victorias secret scents. I admit I'm not very good at describing perfumes but it has a sweet plum scent that appeals to me and the bottle is gorgeous I recommend this one. WOW!,Neutral
I love this scent! It's not too floral and it's not overwhelming. And it has staying power. I've never really smelled another perfume like it. Unique,Neutral
I have only used it once but immediately could smell the perfume. I expect to get a rash from this. I will update if it is otherwise but it really makes me angry when the labels say there is no fragrance. Some of us have horrible reactions to the smelly junk they put in these things. NOT fragrance-free,Neutral
So this just came today and I used it tonight. Seriously this is the first item I bought from Amazon after reading all the great reviews that is sooooo off base! This does take off all your make-up but in exchange for what? For wanting to throw up on yourself while it's on your face? Good lord this smells like an old lady perfume that someone left out sitting in the sun for so long that that the scent turned on itself.I was so convinced by the reviews that I bought a -pack. (sigh) Luckily my sister-in-law remembered the smell from something her Mom used to use a long time ago and may still use today so off they go to her and good riddance....tsk...I can still smell a whiff of it now and then and I washed my face twice already. Geez. OMG WTH IS THAT SMELL?,long time
I have shoulder length naturally wavy hair; not really curls but generous waves.  I like to use this spray when I let my hair mostly air dry & I want extra waves & lasting waves.  There are sections of my hair that are more wavy than others & sections that tend to lose their wave easier.  Those sections get a little more of this product.  This isn't a miracle curl-making product; it works with what you have & you have to treat your curls/waves carefully or they will frizz & go flat even with the product in your hair.This is my technique:-Washed/Conditioned Hair combed out.-While hair is still wet I spray a generous amount of  the Dream Curl product in to my palm & then I put in a tiny drop of argan oil on top of that.  I rub my palms together to mix it & coat my palms.  I find I get much better coverage/control if I work it through my hair instead of spraying it on.  Spraying is also messy.-Then I gently scrunch through my hair.  I do not put this on my scalp.-I often spray a little more Dream Curl on to my palm & put it in the parts of my hair that tend to uncurl easier.-Now I blow dry my roots (bend over with head facing floor) & slightly dry all my hair.  I keep the drier mostly on the low heat & air flow setting.  Blowing my roots gives my hair lift/body.  The heat of the blow dryer seems to make the argan oil & Dream Curl coat my hair better.  Using a diffuser will give you even better/more curls (if you have them to start with).-If I want even more curls I use a diffuser on my blow dryer instead of just drying my roots.  I bend over & gently cup my hair in to the diffuser & push the diffuser to my head.-I comb out my hair with a wide tooth comb being careful not to stretch out my waves.-Then I put my hands under the faucet get them a little wet & scrunch through my hair to revitalize the curl/wave that may have blown out.  I do not get my roots wet because I don't want my roots to go flat.  If I need to neaten up my hair I carefully use a wide tooth comb.-My hair air dries.  I do not comb my hair again until it is completely dry.  If I need to comb my hair I only use a wide tooth comb & I'm careful not to stretch out the waves.  A hair brush will kill your waves/curls.When I use this product all I have to do is dampen my hair with my hands to bring back the waves.  Even the second day I can get away with just dampening my hair.  If I have sections of my hair that are a little frizzy I just use a tiny amount of argan oil to smooth them out.I have used other another company's curl product but it seemed to be more harsh & dried out my hair.  This John Frieda does not seem to cause those problems for me. This product is not overly perfumed.  There is a slight citrusy scent but it goes away.  I do not like heavily scented hair products.This is the Argan Oil I use.  It's not pure Argan Oil but it works!:One N' Only Argan Oil Treatment . Ounce Works For Me,argan oil
Ive heard mixed reviews on this fragrance by Nicole Polizzi (Snooki) but decided to go ahead and purchase it I have a huge perfume collection. When my package arrived I put some on and loved the way it smelled! It's not too overwhelming or too sweet smelling. I'm very glad that I purchased this fragrance. I loved it so much that the day I recieved itI ordered her other perfume Snooki Couture! I can't wait for it to come in! Pleasantly surprised!,Neutral
I can not tell you the number of people who told me I smelt delicious when wearing this perfume. My mother got it for me as a x-mas gift and I was really not looking forward to opening the box. I didn't want to hurt my Mom's feelings so I opened the box but when I smelt it I fell in love with the scent. It's really sexy nothing overbearing and a wonderful perfume to wear in any occasion. The scent is uplifting and just a blend of perfection. It's delicate and very girly. Does not smell cheap or too powerful. It's not too light and not too heavy. I am a true fan of this perfume now and all of my favorite brands (Juicy Couture Beyonce Heat Brittany Spears Fantasy) have now been replaced. SEXY AND SWEET,Neutral
This perfume reminds me of Jessica Simpson's Fancy perfume. It has that baby powder musk type of smell not flowery or fruity. It doesn't smell like candy to me like everyone was saying and it doesn't remind me of Britney Spear's perfume Fantasy either. I recommend smelling it before buying it to smell for yourself. It does smell really good though so even if you do buy it without smelling first I don't think you will be disappointed :) I would recommend this perfume and the price for it on Amazon can't be beat!#LoveSnooki Love it!,Neutral

I've been using this oil for many years. I also alternate extra virgin coconut oil in my hair occasionally but feel that this oil has more of a boost in nutrients with the amla and henna. It helps to keep grays away and I do agree that your scalp has a nice environment for hair growth with this review.I saturate dry hair with it before washing and leave it in as long as I can. I part my hair in four sections and am very generous - a teaspoon on the ends of my hair for each section a teaspoon for the midlengths and roots of each section and comb through massaging into my scalp.I have wrapped hair in a hot towel before to help my hair cuticles open and absorb the oil more which works well too. Whether with or without heat usually my hair has soaked it in and it is not nearly as oily.  I leave it in as long as I can at least an hour. The smell is noticeable but not unforgiving and is gone after a shampoo it doesn't linger. Sometimes in the winter I only co-wash with conditioner and it still washes out well. It washes out relatively easily and really helps to repair hair prevent split ends and gift it a soft strong bouncy texture.I'm natural/chemical-free but have used this before when I've been both relaxed and texlaxed and the results were consistent. I think it works for all hair types - its just enriched coconut oil.************Ingredients:Cocos nucifera oil (COCONUT OIL) HERBAL EXTRACTS [Emblica Officinalis (amla) Fruit Extract Terminalia Chebula Extract Terminalia belirica extract azadirahta indica leaf extract centella asiatica plant extract hedychium spicatum rhiizone extract lawsonia inermis leaf extract].

I get compliments often when wearing this perfume. It's a seductively light fragrance that is very enticing. A classic bold and confident scent. Will be replacing my bottle when it's gone. Love this!,Neutral
Just accidentally I found a sample of this perfume somewhere put it on just to try and in a middle of the day was caught by an incredibly amazing scent that turned out to have come from my wrist where I put the perfume. The scent was so wonderful so I bought the whole bottle and since it's an old scent the price was awesome. I really like this smell it's fresh and a bit oriental. And very very sunny.

I purchased this perfume for my mom. She went shopping one day and bought this lotion. She went to local department stores and this perfume costs about $-$ more. This is a great deal and the perfume shipped really fast. I will purchase this again for her and will definitely recommend and use this seller. The perfume really does smell WONDERFUL! GREAT BUY!!!!! A gift for Mom,Neutral
I love love love the scent but that is subjective. Go to any department store and find out if you love it yourself. What sucks about this perfume is that the scent dissipates within a couple of hours. It's not an all day scent which bugs me. Great scent fades quickly,Neutral
I buy perfumes based on the &#;line&#; and I've had Oscar's perfumes before which were a &#;hit&#; for me and this scent caught my husbands attention.  My &#;mature&#; skin doesn't carry the scent very long so I purchased the lotion so I wouldn't go overboard spritzing myself to layer it. Husband got a whiff of it and enjoyed the experience!,Neutral
I am thrilled to add this to my perfume collection. I love this more than the original princess. As soon as I got this I sprayed it on my wrist to smell the berries and this did not disappoint! I was intrigued by the first whiff I got the scent combination is just lovely. This scent on me smells like Britney Spears Fantasy mixed with the original Vera Wang princess. I can already tell this scent will have a long lasting period and I am happy with my purchase.The delivery was kinda slow BUT you can't blame mother natural and the storms on the east coast recently otherwise I bet this would of been on time which was Monday the th. The packaging is nice and the bottle was beautiful and I adore the glitter :) Beautiful scent :),Neutral
I did not like this scent at all. I love the original VW Princess but this scent was like fake grape medicine or something. I am usually very easy to please when it comes to perfumes but this was just..yuck. I sprayed it and my husband came to kiss me and asked what &#;that smell is&#; and not in a good way. I told him I ordered new perfume and he tried to be nice by saying it smelled good but I knew he was lying. He didn't want to hurt my feelings but was pleased when I said I didn't like it either. I had hoped that after wearing it for awhile it would mix with my skin and maybe smell different but nope still gross. I am not very happy that I could not return it so basically I wasted money on this which is never good news. Other reveiwers loved this perfume and gave it high ratings so clearly its not a bad perfume but just wasn't for me. Oh well. Guess I'm a rebel,Neutral
I saw this perfume at Ulta here in the US. I saved my money and finally bought it. It was suppose to be a limited edition but it is still available in the retail world. If you get a chance smell it. It is a good fresh smell. Vera does it again,Neutral
I've tried a lot of hairsprays over the years and normally gravitate towards products like Big Sexy Hair Spray 'n Play harder when I need something to really hold my hair.  This sounds ridiculous but I saw one of the O.C. Housewives using this (and her hair is gorgeous and not stiff at all) so I thought I'd give it a try.  WOW.  Not only does it hold my hair when I curl it it's also totally flexible so I don't look like I have helmet head.  AND it brushes out completely without leaving residue.  And the biggest reason I love this product is becuase I'm a brunette and it doesn't turn my hair chalky or cause product buildup.  If I don't like my hair after I've styled and sprayed it I can brush through it and all of this product is GONE.  No dust no buildup.  It's like starting from new.  It also works great when I straighten my hair.  If you run into wintertime static like I do a few shots of this will keep your straight hair under control.  And again it does it without making your hair look sprayed.  I actually liked this product so much that I signed up for the Subscription option (auto ship).The one thing I will say is that you want to get the UNSCENTED version of this.  I accidentally bought the scented version and the smell was horrible... it's way too strong and as I've seen in many other reviews it has an old lady perfumed scent to it.  The smell lasts all day and if you're sensitive to scents like I am the scented version will give you a killer headache.  Definitely stick with the unscented version.  It still has a slight scent but no more than other hair sprays. Best flexible hairspray (but get the UNSCENTED version!),Neutral
If you like Pink Sugar cologne don't wait order this lotion today! This smells so similar to Pink Sugar and they compliment each other beautifully. I've been tanning outdoors this summer and trying many lotions to hydrate my skin. This lotion is hydrating makes me a bit shiny and the smell lasts for hours. I have a very hard time  finding perfumes that last on me so for this lotion to do it alone is amazing. The best part is this lotion is paraben and gluten free I'm allergic to both. I also got the shower gel and will be trying other items in this line! scrumptious smelling!,Neutral
I used Sweet and Sexy tanning lotion and loved the scent so much. Upon looking for the tanning lotion online I came across this lotion and had to have it.  The scent is amazing just like candy almost exact to the perfume &#;Pink Sugar&#; it accompanies it wonderfully. It also moisturizers my skin great and leaves it soft for a while. Smells so good!,Neutral
This really does the job when winter comes and it's dry and cold outside.  If you work with cardboard files paper boxes etc. or outdoors it will maintain your skin integrity moisturizing and protecting. If you use too much it may feel a little greasy but use a little less and it should be good to go.This is also helpful for dry cuticles.  I use it at least once or twice a day especially before bedtime.Scent is herbal/grassy and not perfumey - which is great.  I dislike and have intolerance to artificial perfumes and scents. I can tolerate this scent with no problems.Men can use this and not feel girly.Packaging - well they don't like the plastic too much so this is probably a recycled metal and so better for the environment than all the plastic. Twist the cap on straight and it will keep the product inside. Don't bend the tube as it will probably create a crack and the product will come out. Fantastic!,Neutral
Recently I was very tempted to buy a bottle of Tom Ford's Amber Absolute a stunning perfume. However Amber Paste is almost as glorious and is one twentieth the price. Amber Paste has an amazingly complex amber scent -- think major amber chord with minor grace notes of vanilla leather honey/beeswax and bezoin resin. I love you Tom but these are hard times and Amber Paste elevates my spirit without decimating my wallet. Amazing especially for the price . . .,Neutral
Does not smell like Paul Michells Awapuhi Ginger shampoo/conditioner set and is a pretty greasy conditioner. I use maybe less than a teaspoon of this for my shoulder length haircut and still feels like I didn't wash it out enough.The smell is more like a perfume/cologne/old lady/potpourri smell :( Does not smell clean like Awapuhi does,Neutral
I previously tried a product from Sally Beauty that was supposed to be like this stuff but it left my hair greasy and dry when I first used it however it made my hair soft and silky after it was washed out.  I still returned it because of the chemical smell (really it was awful!) but I wanted to find something better that would moisturize my hair without making it greasy and smelly.  I came across this product at Walmart and fell in love with the scent.  It reminds me of my favorite perfume - New York and Company's Love.  I used it in the shower tonight before I shampooed as sort of a hot oil treatment and then washed with Prell and conditioned with olive oil and avocado mask (probably didn't need this step but I did it anyway).  After my hair air dried I rubbed a dime sized amount between my palms and ran it through the ends of my hair and then the roots.  I brushed it through and proceeded to blow dry and flat iron my hair.  It looks and feels INCREDIBLE!  I'm so happy! Hair is soft and silky,favorite perfume
Madini Ambergris smells wonderful as a stand alone scent or is to be used to enhance or add a note to your regular perfume.Whether is's real or synthetic is a moot point.  All of this 'sexy' discussion is superfluous.Most scents like Ambergris were designed to add a particular note to whatever attar you are wearing.For example castoreum which is extracted from male/female beavers adds a leathery note.  Musk adds softness.  And then we have civet which adds yet another note.You just need a drop or two of any animal note to change the personality of your favorite scent.Several years ago musk was removed from perfumes as the musk deer had to be killed to remove the musk pod.  Synthetic musk oil was developed to avoid killing a deer.  In the case of civet the animal had to be beaten with sticks or totmented in order to get the civet to spray.The civet is a distant relative of the cat family. In its raw form civet smells similar to a cat's spray.Recently a procedure was developed to remove the musk pod from the deer without killing it. Ditto with the beaver. More civilized methods were created to avoid harming the civet and beaver while inducing it to spray.  Deer musk obtained humanely is more expensive by the kilo than pure gold.Ambergris which is a large piece of something like a gallstone excreted by certain whales and washes up on beaches.  Whales used to be killed to obtain ambergrisMany of these animal by products smell quite foul by themselves.  But mixed in proper proportion with other ingredients can result in an exotic fragrance. Chanel # uses a civet derivarive.Clarins is currently under fire for using coumarin to add a vanilla note to its Angel fragrance . Coumarin is related to COUMADIN...a blood thinner so a persom wearing Angel could possibly develop a blood clot or stroke merely by spraying  Angel on their body where it penetrates the skin and hits the blood stream where could harm the wearer. Beware of vanilla extract made in Mexico..chances are that it could be made with coumarin beans rather than vanilla beans.I recently purchased a few vials of pure black deer musk from Malaysia .  Not a pretty scent.In essence Madini oils are the finest.  Add a tiny bit to your favorite scent and experience something new.  Madini Ambergris also smells great on it's own.But don't judge it.I've been using Madini attars since the early s and swear by them.Thank you for reading my review of Madini Ambergris. Animalistic Scents,Neutral
Have had it  days and am using it  times daily in a facial/hand cream menage. It'll take about a month to see if it makes a difference but I will stick with it. And no perfumes here. Smells like nut oil. Want to love it,Neutral
I liked the pump and foam delivery system. Applied to damp skin one or two pumps cover face and neck very well. There's a clean natural but neutral feel that's makes the skin neither softer nor moisturized. The moisturizing partner product is necessary...I wish I ordered the moisturizer too. For me as a standalone product it's just OK.This foam cleanser is gentle and non-irritating maybe too gentle because it didn't remove my makeup thoroughly which makes it an UN-welcome addition to nightly skincare routine. It can become part of my morning routine because it did make my oily T-Zone LESS oily throughout the day and probably will reduce my summer oiliness too.The violet perfume smell reminiscent of my centenarian granny is too girly for universal teenager acne appeal. I just can't picture a teenage boy willingly using this product unless in dire straits. Hmmm...Not Sure,Neutral
I like this cleanser/foam wash.  Very nice smell not overly perfumed.  Worked well on my very sensitive skin.  I was born in northern climate have extremely fair skin that gets rosy quickly.  I do not tan I burn. I get pimples all the time I get dry spots on my cheeks chin forehead. I use a very light moisturizer and just plain water most of the time.One thing I did not like about this bottle is the way I had to hold it to get the pump to work. For some reason just having it stand on the counter and pushing down on nozzle did not work just tipped the bottle and make it fly down to the floor.  I wish the design was better. I liked this one but bottle awkward to use,sensitive skin
I've been using Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer for a couple of months now and am quite satisfied with the results.  One of the biggest problems I have with most facial products (even those formulated for oily skin) is that they tend to clog my pores; although it's not specifically advertised as being non-comedogenic I haven't experienced any breakouts at all while using the Cetaphil product.  In addition this moisturizer is non-greasy lightweight absorbs quickly and does not make my face look shiny.  It also isn't heavily perfumed; I can smell it faintly but the fragrance seems natural and it dissipates quickly.  And I think the SPF  works great.As a middle-aged man who is constantly being told that I don't look my age I just want a simple product that applies easily doesn't draw attention to itself and does its job efficiently.  Cetaphil Dermacontrol for Oily Skin with SPF  is perfect for my needs and I'm pleased to be able to recommend it without reservations to you. Feels Great Looks Invisible Does Its Job ... Perfect for Me!,Neutral
I use the other Cetaphil face cream everyday and have for years so I was happy to try this new product. The other cream has  SPF and I've been looking for a  SPF which will not harm my sensitive skin and which is fragrance free. This  SPF product is fragrance free as far as no perfumes but there is a sunscreen smell to it which quickly dissipates once it is applied. It goes on easily smooth and clean and so far it has not upset my skin. When you have sensitive skin this is the main focus to find something that will moisturize without causing any irritation or rash.So far I have not had problems with this at all and I really like the protection. I walk my dogs for miles and miles everyday and I'm out in the sun a lot. It's got to do the job and it seems to work perfectly. For me this is a big plus. I also like the container it dispenses out of a small hole in the top side of the push down mechanism. It's easy to clear off any excess cream which may come out with just a swipe of your finger. The price is a little steep by a dollar or so but it is going to be offered in the Subscribe & Save program at Amazon so this should give us a bit better price once that's set up and ready to go. I will certainly order this and I appreciate that Cetaphil makes a good product for people with sensitive skin. Gentle on my skin.....SUBSCRIBE & SAVE,sensitive skin
I love Cetaphil products their cleansers deliver non-drying clean at a fraction of department store prices . If you own a Clarisonic or similar device the Cetaphil cleansers deliver superior results. Any skin type there is a Cetaphil for it.I have inflammatory skin that breaks out easily. Any day cream has to moisturize without soaking my face in oil and it also has to refrain from giving me acne. Lack of a perfumey smell is a big plus as that contributes to redness for me. Happily I can say that this Cetaphil moisturizer has done everything it promises!I wore this product for three days and had no breakouts or inflammation. It controlled oil just as well as the BB cream I normally wear and did not build up throughout the day. It pairs well with retin-A and Finacea topicals with no stinging or irritation. I am going to keep using this product for my neck area I love how unobtrusive it is how it just sinks in and doesn't feel greasy.Definitely a repeat purchase and recommendation especially for the price. I have had $ creams that are not this nice. It also gives Olay Pro-X a run for the money. Cetaphil delivers again!,Neutral
My partner is the one with the sensitive skin. Any amount of perfume in a product will make him break out. I thought he might like to try this...but he swiftly said he didn't like it.I can't think why. I love it. It softens my skin and is completely lacking in greasiness. I use it on my face and head (I am bald) and it has in the past few weeks made a noticeably difference in my skin. ALSO I like the SPF . I can go out in the sun with my bald pate and not have to immediately put on a hat. (And if I do the hat is not stained by the lotion I have used).This is a little more expensive than the lotion I usually use but I am going to keep using it. Glad it came with a coupon cause I'm going to keep using it,sensitive skin
The best thing about this is the price.  I have to use a LOT of lotion so the fact that it was on the cheap side AND has a high quantity content is great.  The smell is also light so I don't feel like it over powers my high quality designer perfume.  Great buy.  I dont really appreciate that this still has mineral oil in it (which isn't TOO terrible) but if you're looking for a more natural lotion that is also affordable I'd go with something else like Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Lotion.  Some of these lotions (I'm not sure if this is true for all of their scents) has a chemical preservative so it's not % natural but it's pretty close and pretty affordable. Helpful and Realistically Priced,Neutral
This is one of the best scrubs you will ever buy.  Period.  The scrub part truly removes dead skin on normal parts of the body.The moisturizing is superior.  The only tiny problem I have with this is the scent. It's a little on the old-fashioned side kind of perfumey.  The scrubby things really do dissolve and DON'T just sit on the skin.  This is worth  stars alone. DOES THE JOB.,Neutral
I've used this shampoo for almost a week and my hair is responding to it well. It's been a really dry winter and my previous shampoo seemed to be leaching any moisture out of my hair. I'm using both the Toni & Guy Shampoo and Conditioner for Damage Hair and I've noted a marked increase in moisture. My one complain is the smell. These products smell like cheap perfume. I far prefer the more modern herbal scents of products like Aveda. Fortunately the smell doesn't seem to last. Good results bad scent,Neutral
This is a nice light shampoo that's great for people that want a light scent and a touch of conditioning. I was satisfied with the product's performance on my thick hair. I don't like shampoos with a heavy scent so I was happy with the light herbal fragrance of this product. You'll know it's there out of the shower but soon after that it's not strong enough to cover up perfume or cologne. A few reviewers mentioned that the fragrance is on the masculine side; I agree with that assessment though feel that the smell is close to being neutral leaning slightly to a masculine scent. The shampoo does leave hair a little bit softer than many shampoos on the market. Of course it's not the same as using standalone conditioner but it'll get the job done on days when you want to give your hair a break from heavy product use. Light Scent and Light Conditioning,little bit

I used both these Cleanse Shampoo and Conditioner for damaged hair from Toni & Guy together to give the product line a fair shake and I was fairly impressed with the results. My hair is not incredibly damaged but it does suffer from frizziness and flyaway hair to some extent. It's also somewhat dull as much due to my age () as anything else.The combination of both the shampoo and cleanser made my hair look smoother while retaining volume (often a difficult feat) as well as enhanced shine. While I didn't end up with movie-star or model hair it was visibly better than before. This was after only one use so I can imagine it may improve further with multiple uses.Regarding the conditioner I was surprised that it smelled relatively &#;perfumey&#; given that the shampoo smells more &#;clinical&#;. It was a bit strong for my tastes but not overbearing. The criteria I generally establish for how intense the smell is is whether or not it makes me sneeze and this didn't.I used the conditioner in a relatively small amount even though I have very long hair. I started at the mid point and worked to the roots and then rubbed the conditioned hair onto my scalp to spread what was dripping off the ends into the top of my hair. Using such a small amount was a choice I made based on the relatively high cost of this conditioner and it was barely enough to make combing my hair out doable. I generally need a lot of conditioner because of the volume of hair I have and I felt I needed to skimp on this. If you're prone to tangling this probably is not going to be the best choice but you can get by if you're more liberal with the application.I think this did a great job making my hair look closer to what you might see in a magazine ad but it'd didn't completely transform it. I think that with regular use my hair would continue to improve and this is absolutely a higher end product which costs more and gives better results. If you want to put your best foot forward this is probably worth the investment but if your hair generally looks good anyway (as mine did when I was younger) then it may not be worth the added cost. works well to repair but a bit perfumey,Neutral
This works very well especially in conjunction with the shampoo. I have hair that tends to frizz easily and this does give me more manageable control during the day.  The scent is a bit strong but does eventually wear off during the day.  But admittedly I am a bit self conscious for an hour after the shower that I am a cloud of perfume. Works well,Neutral
I like this product - it works great in my thin fine hair.  It's not heavy or sticky/gummy/crunchy which is hard to get on my hair and it holds up the whole day.  I love that it doesn't take a lot of product to get a decent effect on my hair.  So I'll be buying this again.BUT and this is a big but - hope the manufacturer is reading this - it's really got a LOT of perfume odor to it and it sticks with you all day. works,Neutral
Like other reviewers I find this texturising spray to work very well. I have a lot of very fine short hair. I use texturizing sprays too help manage my mane which can get a little unruly depending on the conditions (e.g. moisture in the air wind etc.). I've been using this spray for a few blustery days and it's working well. The hold isn't too stiff and lasts all day. I can do without the perfume smell; however I have noticed that it doesn't seem to be as pronounced once it's applied and doesn't bother me throughout the day like some other products have. Overall I think this product is excellent considering it's about half the price of similar sprays. Excellent except for the smell,Neutral
This is a spray that you can use to give your hair some texture and poof. You simply spray it on with a pump action spray and style your hair. You can blow dry it or scrunch it and let it dry naturally.My daughter has stick straight fairly thin hair. When we tried this on her hair we did not notice much in the way of extra body or texture. We sprayed it on and then let it air dry. What we did notice was that when she washed her hair it was a softer hair similar to something you might experience when you have been at the beach in the salt water for a day. That was an added bonus.I tried it on my older lady curly graying hair. I pumped it on and let it dry naturally. It resulted in a more textured curly hair style for me. One thing I noticed that I didn't like was that it had a somewhat 'crunchy feel' to it.Similar to other reviewers I will say this- It was smelly. I can't say that I thought it was a bad smell but it was a strong smell. We thought it might have smelled like sea salt water and perfume at the beach. This would have been fine as it was sprayed on but it had a strong smell all day long we both commented that we would often smell it during the day.Overall it worked on my hair but not on my daughters very stick straight thin hair. It is a nice product but be aware that it has a smell to it. Enjoy. Works Well,Neutral
I often buy hair products to try to give my fine flat hair some body. Usually the work in an okay way...but nothing special. Either they don't smell good are too sticky or get my hands all sticky or stiff. So I usually just buy something else next time to see if I like it better. This stuff however is different from anything I have used.You just spritz it on when your hair is wet and dry (I use a blow dryer when I use &#;products&#;...didn't try this with an air-dry.) As soon as your done you will notice your hair looks...bigger. Not Motley Crue big...but fluffy. And it has a texture which is VERY much like how your hair feels after being on the beach--like there is something in your hair...almost dirty but in a pleasant way. Not crunch not sticky just bigger. I often use thoseCaruso steam rollersto give my hair curls or waves (depending on the size of the roller. And with this my curls last DAYS...seriously. They are there until I wash them out.The fragrance of the product is light. I sometimes like the perfume-y pretty smelling things but they never last anyway so minimal fragrance is fine. And it isn't a bad smell (sometimes they smell cheap or medicinal or something.) It doesn't seem to add any shine which most texturizers don't and I suppose they are different products. Shine with slippery stuff no extra shine with thickening stuff...maybe shine makes your hair strands too smooth...so you lose texture. You can always add a shine-type spray at the end if you really like that. I have some argan holding spray that I use anyway so it does add a little shine that this hides.This is something I will definitely replace when it is gone! Like BEACH hair!,Neutral
I've enjoyed trying the Toni & Guy products this month and it's a brand I will look for and purchase in the future especially their regular conditioner which is fabulous. This product is a leave in conditioning product that you put on after you wash and condition your hair and before blow drying and styling. It takes a quarter size portion for my hair so a little goes a long way. It adds conditioning and helps my hair deal with harsher treatments of blow drying and flat iron use which can really leave the ends of my hair dead. This is a good product to combat the dryness from blow drying and flat irons.This conditioner has a light scent which is not over powering or perfumey. I like the idea of the leave in conditioner when my hair has been over worked and it works great to protect hair in between trims to keep the ends looking healthy. It adds some body and bounce while making hair easy to style. Conditioning That Lasts,long way
I really like the way Toni&Guy products smell. It has a clean fresh scent that isn't too perfumey. The leave-in conditioner makes my hair feel soft and not frizzy. The directions say to use a walnut size portion but that's way too much. I'd say a grape size dollop is probably enough for long hair and less for short hair. I don't use it all over just on the lower half of my hair where it needs it the most. It doesn't leave my hair sticky and it's easy to brush while wet and style it. This product is perfect for dry winter weather when my hair usually feels dried out and full of static electricity. It tames my hair and makes it much nicer. Love the scent and how it makes my hair feel,Neutral
I love love love St Ives products they're always moisturizing and soothing and this lotion is no different! It is thick and rich it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave you feeling greasy or tacky. This particular product is one of the most highly perfumed lotions out of any of the St Ives lotions I have used! I was surprised at how strong the scent was I think because this is very flowery when most St Ives lotions are not. I highly recommend you try to find this and take a whiff in store before buying.It has a very unique smell I detect multiple different scents in this lotion: coconut milky slightly musky brown sugar tropical (I guess the orchid?). It fades to a nice subtle version of the initial very strong scent. I don't feel the need to wear perfume when I put this on which would make it a perfect summer scent.All-in-all I'm not a huge fan of this particular scent so I won't be reordering but I hope my input helps you in your decision! Very pungent!,Neutral
St. Ives Naturally Indulgent Body Lotion with Coconut Milk & Orchid Extract is one of my favorite lotions. I've used a LOT of different lotions and I can tell you that this is a quality lotion that is comparable to high-end lotions that are x the price. Not only does it smell amazing it is also extremely moisturizing. A lot of lotions that smell good have too much perfume in them and actually end up drying your skin. This lotion smells wonderful and hydrates your skin at the same time. I put this lotion on my whole body after every shower and I've been complimented on how soft my skin is. Living in Chicago during the winter my skin used to be extremely dry and sometimes crack. Since I've been using this lotion I never have that problem anymore. It's a non-greasy lotion and it dries super quick. An added bonus: it's free of parabens and phthalates. You can't beat the price; try it for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about!! comparable to high-end lotions,Neutral
This has a nice smell but it does not linger too long to mix with your perfume.  My husband even likes it so that says a lot to me.  The price was not bad but it is not a cheap lotion.  I would purchase again. Nice Smell,Neutral
This perfume is one of my favorites to wear but when I noticed it seemed to be different I went ahead and gone to the mall to get another bottle of it. I did a comparison wearing the one purchased on Amazon one day and the one from the mall the next day. They do smell different and I noticed that right away. The one from Amazon does not have that light sweet smell that I am used to. It does not last all day where as the one from the mall does. They are somewhat similar but not the same. Needless to say I am disappointed and will never purchase this product from Amazon again. Not what I thought,Neutral
This is the real Gucci guilty intense perfume. Smells exactly like the one in the store!!! My package was not open was not tampered with and there is no strong alcohol smell. My older one has more of an alcohol smell than this one does and it's from Macy's. I love love love this scent. It's so sexy! Every time I wear it men always ask me &#;what are you wearing?&#;  I recommend you try this one in the store and if you love it buy it here at a fraction of the department store price. Thank you amazon! This is the real deal,Neutral
I use this product every evening before bedtime on my handsarmsand feet. It has an excellent moisturizing effectand I highly recommend it to everyone no matter what skin type.I have normal to oily skin but my feet/heels and elbows get dry and it works perfectly on all areasgives just the right amount of moisture. The only thing I would change if I could is smellit's kinda too strong for my taste for bedtime.Maybe it's some plant that I don't get along withbut again it's organic and I am not switching back to perfumed ones just because they smell better and don't give me anything else beside good smell!:) Thanks again for great product lineso far the best I ever tried! Very hydrating cream!,great product
I've been using makeup removing wipes for a few months now.  I prefer the wipes to soap and water because honestly the wipes do a better job removing facial oil and makeup.  You can also get a lot closer to the hairline when using the wipes.  With soap and water you either have to leave an uncleaned ring around your hair line or a get your hair full of soapy water.  The wipes solve that problem.As for the Biore brand of towelettes they have an interesting honeycomb texture that makes them feel stretchy.  They are not as thick as some of the other brands I've tried but they are thick enough not to tear or get pulled apart.I am very sensitive to smells and can't stand anything too perfumey but I had no problem with these wipes.  They have a slight lemony scent but it is mild and pleasant.  The scent does linger a bit but it is gone as soon as I use my toner and moisturizer.And the wipes really get the job done.  They cleaned all the oil makeup and mascara off my face and left no residue.The only issue I had with the wipes is that my face felt a little dry after using them.  Not really dry just not moisturized.  I've been using the Oil of Olay Regenerist brand and they seem to leave my face softer and more moisturized.  Moisturizer from a cleansing wipe is not an issue with younger females but with my + year old skin I need all the help I can get.*** Revised // to  stars:  for product  for packaging. ***The package WON'T STAY CLOSED!!  I've only been using the product for a few days and the sticky stuff that holds the flap closed is no longer sticking.  I had to use tape to keep it from opening on it own and drying out all the remaining wipes.  Not a good package design.*** // ***Just finished the pack of towelettes and despite the fact that the packing would seal the towelettes remained moist!!  I was surprised that after  days of being partially exposed to the air that they were as dry as the desert.So don't freak out (like I did) if the package won't stay closed.  The towelettes won't dry out. Nice honeycomb texture pleasant lemony scent but package won't stay closed,Neutral
I am a + female who has had acne pretty much my whole life.  It's always spotty but it still tend to get breakouts now and then even as I approach !  Anyhow I've used a lot of different facial cleansers and I really likeAveeno Active Naturals Clear Complexion Cream Cleanser  Ounce.  The Aveeno product and this Biore product have the same active ingredient: % Salicylic Acid (for acne treatment) but they are formulated differently.what I like best about the Biore product is that it feels refreshing - it has some menthol in it which causes a soothing cooling feeling as soon as you start to apply it.  Some reviewers I've seen have felt that it is too perfumy  but I think it's more of a clean fresh scent rather than perfumy.  I'm not big into perfume and if it was too perfumy my boyfriend would be sneezing and have migraines as just about any type of perfumy fragrance gives him a reaction.The other thing I like about this Biore cleanser is that it's not as gritty as the Aveeno.  Granted the Aveeno is still a great product and it's not as gritty as other facial scrubs but this Biore cleanser has like small smooth beads in it that roll over your skin as you wash.  For some people they may like the feel of the gritty stuff and think that is really cleaning their skin but if your skin is oily you have large pores and/or you break out often those gritties could be causing more harm to your skin.  It can cause tiny tears in your pores and actually make them larger (or appear so) so best to stay away from the gritty scrub stuff.  (and no I'm not a dermatologist and it's possibly I am mistaken but I learned this from the many seminars/workshops I attended when I was a skin care consultant for a major cosmetic company during my college years).I have been using this Biore cleanser for a little over a week now and my skin does appear cleaner and my pores are less clogged than usual even with using the Aveeno cleanser daily. (I do have large pores especially around my nose which are tough to get completely clean since I wear foundation pretty much every day - Biore facial strips and a creamy facial mask are best for a deep pore clean - but only use those like once a month or my face gets really dry with peeling skin).Bottom line while I still like the Aveeno cleanser I'm sold on this Biore cleanser!  I love the clean fresh feeling I get when I wash my face with it. My New Favorite Facial Cleanser,great product
I found this cleanser to do an excellent job. The scrubbing beads are more gentle and somewhat fewer than one of the Nutrogena scrubs I have tried a bit more agressive than another. For me the results were clean moist skin without drying or itching (and we have hard water). The moisture content for me was ideal.Another great thing while most cleansers of this type come in . or . sizes this tube was . ounces. Very nice.I have sensitive skin and allergies and I worry about using a new product especially one that smells so flowery. However no allergic reaction at this point but I will edit this review if it should happen.All in all I thoroughly like this cleanser and will plan on purchasing it in the future. Very gentle cleanser a bit perfume-y,sensitive skin
First off thanks to the reviewer who took the extra time to read the ingredients and list them here - my eyes can't handle the small print on product packaging :)That said I did like this product as a facial cleanser - not sure what the detoxifying means. I don't wear heavy makeup and no mascara (allergies) so I'm not too fussy choosing facial cleaners as long as they aren't strongly scented and/or irritate my skin. I like the packaging with the push dispenser at the top I can pump right into my hand without lifting it off the counter or spillage (big plus). It comes out nice and foamy without being thick and gooey and rinses off quite easily. I didn't pick up on any strong perfumes either another big plus for me. Definitely a product I would consider purchasing. No complaints here,Neutral
I don't typically expect my cleanser to do anything other than cleanse so I was curious about the -in- concept.  I'm not really sure I can tell any difference from just a -in- cleanser.When you push down on the pump the cleanser comes out in a little foamy puff so it goes on your face foamy.  It does a good job and doesn't leave my face feeling too dry.I have sensitivities to scent so I try to use scent-free products as much as possible.  This has a nice very light scent that I originally assumed was from the plant extracts in the ingredients.  There is fragrance in the ingredients list but the scent doesn't seem perfume-y and it doesn't bother me.I like this product but haven't yet decided whether it will replace my usual cleanserCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser For all skin types -Ounce Bottles (Pack of ). Foamy & smells nice (but not perfume-y),Neutral
I have extremely sensitive skin - I can't use a wash cloth as it causes my face to dry out and scab (like hundreds of small wounds) so finding a facial cleanser that can work is difficult.  There are a number of extremely expensive soaps (the type you buy at department store perfume counters) that I can use; however I have never found a reasonably priced soap that I can buy on Amazon or at a local store until I found Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser.  I use it sparingly a little in hand during my shower.  By using it first and rinsing thoroughly throughout the shower I avoid having any residue left to dry to skin.I was afraid that it would dry my skin so much that I would need moisturizer to get it feeling normal but that was not the case.  My face feels clean but not at all dry.  The oily parts of my skin (especially around my nose) feel nice too.All in all a great product that I will use daily.  I highly recommend it.Update:  July   - I have now been using this soap daily for more than three months.  I like it even better today than I did when I originally wrote my review.  It will be my first choice of facial soaps from now on.  The best part is that you only need a tiny dab so the bottle is still more than / full after more than  days.  A great product and a great value. Works fantastic for my sensitive combination skin,great product
I have sensitive skin that tends to get a bit dry in the winter. Well this works. It had little beads in i that exfoliate. The beads are not  coarse so you don't feel as if you're ripping your face off like with some other products on the market. I also must say the smell is great. I try to stay away from perfumed products due to the nature of my skin. But this didn't harm it. The product is very thick. I wet my face first put a nice sized dollop on the palm of my hand added a bit of water to loosen it up rubbed my hands together &#;- that's a must don't apply directly to your face &#; this heats up pretty strongly and can give off a strong burning sensation.It's an excellent product that has helped brighten my skin during these last lingering days of winter. Great but a Bit Drying.,sensitive skin
This lotion is the best drug store lotion out there. Not greasy very moisturizing and great smelling. Many people recommend Eucerin but I just can't stand the grease slick it leaves behind. This lotion does the trick without making me feel greasy or dirty. I use it on my legs after I shave and it keeps razor burn away. A few times I've even had people ask what perfume I was wearing and all I had on was this lotion. It smells clean and fresh almost like I've got that freshly-showered soapy smell. Love it!! Moisturizing and smells fabulous!,Neutral
I've come to really appreciate St. Ives lotions!  This one is no exception.  The smell is light enough so I can wear my designer perfume but the content is strong enough that I can get away with just using it once right after I shower and not worry about unsightly dry skin or discomfort later. I highly recommend this lotion and recommend just buying it on-line so that you don't have to run around looking for it and you have it on hand.  I also like the other scents so I recommend mixing it up a bit.  You can't loose. The only thing I don't like is that it still has mineral oil in it which coats skin.  It is good for people like me with very dry skin to use on winter days but in the summer I wouldn't need something with the oil in it. Cheap AND Helpful Winning Combo,dry skin
I wasn't a fan but that was mostly due to the overwhelming strong perfumed scent. I used product several times but could not tolerate the after smell. It did great removing BB cream but I did not enjoy having to smell it for several hours after. If you are sensitive to strong scents I would not recommend. Strong Scent IMO,Neutral
I received this product as a sample with a Skin BB cream pack that I bought from Katie the Babe.  I am normally super picky with cleansers because my skin is super super sensitive and often perfumed soap and cleanser break me out in a mild allergy rash but I was out of my normal cleanser and my face felt icky after a long day at work and  degree Texas weather.  I must say I was extremely impressed with this cleanser it was very gentle on my skin extremely effective and I love the way it smells really clean.  I followed it up with my hypoallergenic lotion and my skin feels better than it ever has.  I have a hard time finding something I like this much. I have true combination skin it's dry and flaky on my chin between my eyes and on both sides of my nose but my cheeks and forehead are very oily and acne prone.  I have a feeling this cleanser would do wonders for my skin with extended use and I love it as much as the other Skin products I have tried.  This is also a very versatile cleanser as I think it would work well for any age or skin type and even though it has a heavy fragrance it seems very mild.  I love it!! Awesome cleanser!,Neutral
very strong scent but is a great detangler  kinda looks like oil so you have to shake it so and so perfume smell,Neutral
I have natural waves in my hair and I used to try different types of hair mousse every time I went shopping. Last summer I discovered Dove's cream mousse and have religiously used it since! Unlike other mousses it doesn't leave my hair feeling hard and looking super crunchy if I use a small amount and evenly disperse it my hair doesn't look like it has mousse in it at all! I also love the smell! It is very fresh and faint so it doesn't smell like a strong perfume like other mousses do. If you are hesitating buying it I would recommend trying it because it has worked so well for me! Wonderful!,Neutral
This bottle is the perfect size to carry a small amount of your favorite perfume that doesn't come in smaller sizes with you. It included  mini-dropper style pumps to put liquid in the bottle.Cap came off easily to fill and snapped back on tightly enough that I'm not worried about leaking or evaporation. Perfect Size for purse or travel,favorite perfume
I originally used this for travel oil and it leaked. I then tried it for travel perfume and it leaked but not as bad as the oil. So now I just use it for perfume (just keeping it upright on my vanity). It seems like a tightly fit cap... and I made sure it was on all the way. Considering the price I may try another one. Mine leaked,Neutral
I love perfume but I prefer to choose the scents that I wear and I would never choose a scent like this one: it really does smell like my grandma's bathroom (she loved perfume too so her bathroom always smelled very floral.)  Since most women who like perfume are generally pretty picky about I don't understand why L&oacute;real would intentional pour such a strong floral scent into this cream.  Smell aside it's also pretty heavy and little greasy feeling.  I can usually find at least one good thing to say about most products but with this one I just can't. Smells like grandma!,Neutral
I'll admit that I don't wear perfume every day - in fact I use it maybe  times a year so I am probably more sensitive to scents than most women but to me this cream smelled so overpoweringly of old-fashioned floral perfume that I've only used it a few times. When I have it on I can smell it all day long and to me it's not a pleasant scent.Other ladies obviously like the scent and it probably adds to their enjoyment in using this cream but for those who have sensitive sniffers or who are allergic to floral scents you might want to avoid this one. Too much floral for my face.,Neutral
This B&B cream is advertised in all of the magazines I read so I thought I would try it. It doesn't offer the coverage as advertised has a strong perfume smell and is very thick. I ordered the light/medium color and it's not light enough for my pale skin so I guess I'll try to use less and see if that helps. The tube is different than in all of the advertisements so either Garnier changed their product design or this is a knock-off. Don't waste your money. Not at all what I expected,Neutral
I bought this a few weeks back and have been using it fairly regularly sparked by the word that these BB creams moisturize and go beyond.Initially I gave it a higher rating but I'm taking it down to  stars.For starters I was surprised by how dark this was for a light/medium creme. Also I have to say it has a very strong smell. It's more perfumed than a lot of hand creams! It's distracting and my face feels itchy after using it.I'm not sure it's done a good job on easing some discoloration and adding radiance. I like that it has spf protection but using it and my skin has broken out worse than when I was a teenager. I'm not sure the cause but I'm sure that the fragrance isn't helping.The price is decent but I decided to throw out the remainder of the tube and go with something unscented. Decent except it smells way too strong,Neutral
I've had good luck with products that make bold statements like miracle. Unfortunately it had a heavy perfume smell. It looks like a decent product otherwise but I can't get past the smell. Whether it's to cover up chemicals or they think people will like it I don't know. Strong perfume smell,Neutral
I have very dry very sensitive skin and mild rosacea. I also have fine lines some deeper wrinkles and dry patches as I am yrs old. I have tried many many foundations and BB creams from Oriental BB creams High end anti-aging foundations drugstore brands and primer/moisturizer/make-up combinations. None has ever worked as well as this product. The effect is luminous sheer coverage. It glides on. It does not settle in lines wrinkles or dry patches. I can skip primer. I applied on clean moisturized skin with a sponge wedge. I did find I have to use a moderate amount of product but the tube is a good size and the price is inexpensive. I am very light skinned and always choose the most ivory of foundations and this product was a perfect match for me. I did not need powder to set only a small amount of concealer due to my rosacea blemishes. This is SHEER coverage most like a tinted moisturizer. If you are looking for a moderate coverage type foundation you will need to use more concealer or apply powder over it. I have seen an improvement in the overall texture of my skin since using this BB cream. The only drawback is the fragrance it is very heavy upon application. The fragrance dissipated after a minute or two. I do wish they would reformulate a fragrance free product.

I am all about lighter makeups like tinted moisturizers or BB creams. I am not a big foundation - powder etc person. I love this cream's coverage for my face and it seems to last throughout the day for me. It's been really cool lately though so that could be why. It might not fare well in warmer climates where one might be sweating a little more than where I am now. The thing I hate about this cream is that it has a very strong perfumed scent. I wouldn't recommend this cream to anyone with any sensitivities to stronger scents. The scent itself is not all that unpleasant but it is STRONG and doesn't fade away very quickly. I could smell it for hours. Even on my hands where I had applied it had gotten washed a few times and I still smelled a bit of it on them. Good except for the scent..,Neutral
If you are fair do not go anywhere near this stuff. It is the lightest shade I could find. The texture is great though the perfume is a bit strong. It is very very moisturizing which I loved but I am very fair and blond. I tried mixing this and lightening it but there really was no way to make it work. Great stuff but much too dark for light/fair skin!!!,Neutral
I love this! It smells amazing without all the harsh perfumes that normally accompanying shampoos this fragrant and it really does put a beautiful shining in your hair. Smells like teen spirit,Neutral
This was too smelly for me to use so I gave it to my sister.  I don't' understand why they make things that go next to your nose with such a strong perfume smell.  It also conflicts with your own perfume choice.  Nasty. Smelly,Neutral
This stuff is really good! It's not heavy or thick it doesn't have scary chemicals in it and this particular fragrance is nice and light not too perfumed. Can't beat it for the price!,Neutral
I'm crazy about lavender  I love that spicy almost citrusy scent of pure lavender oil and how it does soothe my nerves.  I have a variation of dermatitis and my skin dries out very quickly so I wanted something closer to organic (fewer harsh irritants) but in a good quantitiy so I don't have to buy lotion again every two weeks or so (I have to lotion every day).Man does this fit the bill!  It's thcker than I thought which is great but absorbs pretty quickly.  While I was putting it on I was overwhlemed by the strong lavender scent.  I was worried it was going to stay that strong all day but after a few minutes it had reduced to the &#;soft&#; lavendar scent no spicy undertone.  Within an hour there's really no scent to it at all.  This works for me because I do like to wear different perfumes and body mists.  So I can use this lotion and my perfumes without worrying about the scents clashing.My skin stays well moisturized all day - I've even done the scratch test the folliwng morning before my shower and my skin is still not dry.  oz. will easily last me a month and a half maybe  months.  And at  bucks a bottle that definitely works for my budget.This is my new staple and I will be signing up for the subscribe & save program when I order my next bottle.  I hope they don't change a thing about this stuff it's perfect as is and I love it! Lavender Blast In My Face! I'm in Heaven ^_^,Neutral
I got this in a Target beauty bag... I tried it in my legs before bed and immediately loved it. I have eczema and often it becomes exacerbated by lotions particularly Nivea... Not so from this product.My skin is soft and comfortable and not greasy!I do often mix in my perfume when I use it and it is a great way to layer scent. Although the scent is a bit strong it doesn't seem to clash with perfume (most perfumed moisturizer doesn't agree with me so this is a great solution)Although its not my holy grail for hands I love it as a body lotion. Good stuff,Neutral
This stuff works great but WOW the perfumey smell is overwhelming.....yuk.  It does dissipate after awhile but it is too strong.  Won't be buying it again. Could have been ,Neutral
I have enjoyed trying the Motions hair products lately and this cleanser is no exception. This creamy rich shampoo rinses out wonderfully and leaves hair clean and bouncy with a really nice scent that isn't too perfumey fake or strong. I have fine hair that isn't very thick. It's a little dry on the ends because I use a blow dryer and flat iron. This shampoo along with the Motions Deep Conditioning Hair Masque work really well together on my hair. These products leave my hair clean light feeling and easy to comb and style. This shampoo is a plus-it doesn't strip hair nor leave it overly conditioned. I will definately look for this is the store. Motions is a nice product line that works well and isn't overly expensive like many of the hair care products out there today and it offers comparable results. Smells Great - Makes Hair Soft,Neutral
Leaves my hair clean and strong and easy to manage.  The instructions say you should use this once a week. I have noticed the more I use it the stronger my hair feels.  And I like the smell not too much of a perfume smell but light and fragrant. Good shampoo and conditioner,Neutral
This is basically a  in  combo of shampoo and conditioner.  Which is my favorite way to shampoo my hair because it saves me water money and time.  I used this product just as the directions indicated and it foamed up nicely and cleansed my hair nicely too.  I could detect no perfume or any smell whatsoever and that is always very good as far as I'm concerned.It came out of the bottom of the tube easily be careful or too much might squirt out.  It was similar in viscosity to snot.  I know that is gross but it really looked like a thick line of snot in my palm except it was white and not greenish-yellow.It rinsed out well and I was able to easily comb the tangles out of my wet hair.  My hair felt soft after blow-drying but had some static fly-away which is always a nuisance and the reason for the  stars instead of .  But static fly-away is often a problem with  in  products. Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser,Neutral
Great value... especially for what it does. Not only does this product work but it looks good.. the packaging I mean and the smell is clean and simple and does not clash with your perfume. Its not ugly in your bathroom with the simple calm colors of the packaging. Good work.,Neutral
First let me say that these products are primarily for people of color and I'm about as pale as it gets. That said my hair is curly frizzy kinky choose the adjective so I figured I'd give it a try. But I couldn't this product has a very strong perfumey scent that gave me an instant headache when I opened the jar. No way I could put it on my head. Too perfumey to use!,Neutral
After a year of dyeing dangerously my hair looked and felt like straw. With winter frizz and terminal hat hair I was desperate for some relief. I have not had great luck with deep conditioners. They tended to be too heavy weighing down my hair instead of imparting softness shine and body.This product has a semi liquid consistency rather like partially melted butter. The fragrance is strong but pleasant and did not linger in my hair. (Note my hair only accepts noxious odors like cigarette smoke and burnt grease. I could pour a bottle of perfume on it and no one could tell.)I followed the deep conditioning directions that is use a plastic cap and low heat on the hair dryer. It rinsed out with ease and the end results were good.  My hair looked and felt soft but still had body. I didn't notice any difference in shine but overall there was noticeable improvement.My biggest quibble is the print on the tub. It is small and hard to read. Part of that is attributable to the small font and the remainder to the chestnut colored ink on the gold/beige background. Otherwise the tub itself is plastic and unlikely to break a boon for the fumble fingered.This is a fine product sure to rememdy the over colored permed plain old dry hair blues. Hair RX,Neutral
Like so many of my fellow fair-skinned females I've struggled all my life to find a makeup pale enough to match my skintone. Even the fairest products from every makeup company were too dark for me. After sifting through TONS of positive reviews all over the internet I thought I'd bite the bullet and try Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in # (Milky or Bright Beige). MAN am I glad I did. Not only does it blend PERFECTLY with my super fair skin tone (I'm Caucasian btw) it truly is a perfect cover with regard to redness dark circles etc. The biggest happy surprise was that after only two uses my usually red t-zone is no longer red. My skintone actually looks more even now--and that's only after a matter of DAYS! It's so weird to actually find a beauty product that does what it SAYS it does. Thus I can say for sure that the whitening effect really does work. Not sure about the wrinkle remover aspect however. That may take more time. What I CAN say is that this stuff makes my skin look like porcelain. I'm hooked.PROS: (Where to begin?) Great for super pale girls...but not TOO light for slightly darker girls. Perfect porcelain skin. Actually whitens typically red areas. Covers undereye circles beautifully. Great coverage. Doesn't take much product at all. Etc. Etc. Etc.CONS: Ummmmm.......[thinking]..well the smell is rather strong as others have mentioned. Quite perfume-y. Can induce some oilyness if you're prone to that. Ummm....................Highly recommended....by someone who's usually skeptical of such miracle products. It's a miracle. I'm sold. It's a Miracle. I'm a Believer.,Neutral
I wear sun screen every day.  So when I saw this product I decided to try it.When I received it I was surprised to find that it had a color (skin color).  But I tried it anyway.  For some reason the color disappears when you rub it on.It has no scent and is invisible once I rubbed it on.  I like that because I prefer to use mens perfume without a conflicting scent.I have not had any problems with sun burn.  The product goes on smooth and once it's rubbed in you will not know it's there.It's a nice product at least as good as the product I usually use. Great!,Neutral
This is a great sunscreen.  It goes on smooth and feels like satin on the skin.  It also feels weightless and dissapears into your skin perfectly.  Does not leave any oil on the skin or a shine whatsoever.Plus the SPF factor is great -- ! -- and it's got broad enough protection to cover both UVA and UVB rays i.e. the ones that cause cancer and the ones that cause premature aging.  It does have a pigment to it but it disappeared rather quickly.It also doesn't have any annoyingly perfumey or chemically smells which I love.  I will happily use this over any drugstore or over-the-counter brand anyday. This stuff is awesome,Neutral
The perfume was everything I asked for. It came unbroken not even scratched and smelled exactly as I remembered in the store. The bottle is adorable too. Awesome,Neutral
The pear is the strongest fruit note in MEOW and gives the fragrance a light and watery feel. Combined with the whisper of tangerine I find the fruits used in MEOW to be milder and fresher then those used in Purr. I also think there is a touch of peach to soften the fresh feel of the watery pear note down a bit. The soft vanilla is present through all of the fragrance with adds a creamy sweetness and warmth to the mix from the start.The floral notes used for MEOW are disappointingly underdeveloped. Aside from a breeze of orange blossom and subtle honeysuckle none of them are strong enough to stand out individually from the fruits and vanilla. This is definitely a fruity perfume. I sometimes think that I can make out the lily but it's too short-lived to really be sure what I think I'm sniffing.There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base thanks to the constant trickle of pear peach and vanilla. The sandalwood and musk are mingled closely together so it is a warm and creamy mix - nice but it is nothing we haven't seen before many many times.***Scent notes; Tangerine pear jasmine gardenia honeysuckle lily of the valley orange blossom amber vanilla sandalwood and musk.***MEOW is richer with the fruits then it is with the florals so the lasting power is nothing to shout about. It averages between four to five hours - good but nothing special. Purr focused on the fruit notes over the florals to but it still isn't as light as MEOW.As this is mild and sweet it seems like a playful fragrance. I think that this is best worn for casual daytime wear as I personally think it's a bit too young for work. As it's mild and not very long lasting I find it too 'gentle' for evening wear but if you don't wear perfume whilst out for a statement and to be noticed then go for it.I asked my Mum to pick up a bottle when it was released in America close to Christmas last year. It was nice enough but I found it too mild and watery in colder weather and the coldness seemed to halve the lasting power so I didn't wear it much. But now that its getting a bit lighter and slightly warmer I'm finding MEOW much more enjoyable to wear. Plus the fruit is watery and the florals mild so it'll carry through to the summer months too.***Overall: MEOW is 'nice'. It's pleasant and easy to wear but it isn't in the slightest bit original and the mildness of the different scent notes make it seem quite flat and one dimensional. Pair that with the so-so wear and you get another average been-there-sniffed-that release. Out of the Katy Perry releases I'd recommended Purr over this as the floral notes are a bit more developed. MEOW reminds me of something but I can't quite put my finger on what. Victoria's Secret Pear Glace body mist or perhaps one of the Harajuku Lovers releases. Aha; now I think it was actually Christina Aguilera's Secret Potion. So iff you like that then it'd be fairly safe to order a bottle of MEOW untested online. It doesn't have the heart of a lion...,Neutral
If you love the smell of vanilla then this is the perfume for you.  The perfume stays with you and is not overbearing.  I receive many compliments from both male and female on what I'm wearing.   stars for this perfume,Neutral
I thought the bottle was cute and bought it as more of a decor but wow the smell is horrible.  It's sort of like a body spray trying to be a perfume mixed with a headache.  I guess this would be a hit with pink sugar fans as it is very similar.  It's nothing I would be caught wearing though.  There are so many beautiful fragrances out there don't waste your time on this one. Too sweet and cheap smelling - a lot like Pink Sugar,Neutral
Pleasant like a fruity  milkshake but it's so soft I don't even notice it unless I smell my skin directly. No sillage whatsoever. This would make a great first perfume for a five year old girl.It's not as good as other celebrity fragrances like Britney Spears Fantasy and Jessica Simpson's Fancy. Pleasant fragrance but way too soft.,Neutral
Meow is great.  Smells like sugar but not as overpowering as Pink Sugar or Fantasy.  It's nice and light feminine and tasty. A terrific perfume for such a low price.  And I think the bottle is absolutely adorable! Too cute NOT to have in my collection! CUTE & SWEET!,Neutral
I love this perfume and the price but the perfume doesn't stay as long as I wish. However that's okay... I still love it!!!! MEOW.... LOVE IT,Neutral
I would have never expected to love a perfume by Katy Perry (not that she is not great........but I am not young)  I was at nordstroms to buy Prada Candy and the sales woman suggested that I smell the Meow.  Much to my surprise I fell in love with it and it is now a staple for me. my favorite,Neutral
This is a sweet fruity floral very feminine smell.  It's sweet without being childish or cloying.  It was the first of the three Katy Perry perfumes I purchased (I also have the similarly delectable &#;purr&#; and the sophisticated &#;Killer Queen&#; although I am not a fan of Ms. Perry's music I must say her range of scents is very nice.  It has good staying power and even my perfume hating husband likes this one.  I'm in my mid twenties and am pleased to report that this doesn't have the &#;cotton candy nightmare&#; scent I associate with young teenage girls and I as a married woman who owns a home and runs a small business can wear it without feeling at all inappropriate.  Also honestly the packaging is really rather cute which is what attracted me to it in the first place. Feminine fruity and really rather fun.,Neutral
Katy is one of my idols and absolutely love her! She has picked me up when I was down plenty of times!After I purchased her 'Purr' fragrance I immediately found out about 'Meow!' it was a little irritating since i felt like i was late on everything Katy lol Nonetheless this perfume is very sweet! very fluffy and delicate. It will leave you feeling cute. It smells like vanilla and maybe some cotton candy. After all it is based on her California Dreams Tour! and she did want it to smell like her Caliornia Gurls &#;Candyfornia&#; setting. As for duration I would say it lasts about - hours (for me) it all depends on your skin really. Everyone is different. Overall great fragrance! I look forward to her new scent 'Killer Queen' ! Smell like Candyfornia!,Neutral
I already have the Purr bottle which I adore and now I bougth the Meow kitty perfume and I am so in love with my two cats. Both are delicious lasting and so sexy perfumes. Katy and her wonderful perfumes,Neutral
I love this. It's my signature scent! Very sweet and soft. Seems innocent too. I totally dig it. I wanna buy another bottle so when I run out I don't have to be without it. Only downside is that it doesn't last long. Many perfumes give me headaches but not this one. It's perfect! So happy! I would recommend to anyone. Definitely for a sweet perfume lover. It bubbly and fun. All time favorite!,Neutral
I love the scent the bottle and of course the price!!It has a sweet scent that any age would love it!I totally recommend this perfume Meowwww!!,Neutral
I love the shape of the bottle and the smell. It's not overpowering but it lasts for me. I usually spray some in my hair before I leave and I get whiffs of it through out the day. Great perfume,Neutral
This smells like candy cotton candy pear!! Its so light fresh and delicious! Love the color and unique bottle. Will order again and again! Best perfume!!,Neutral
I am giving this  stars based on the fact that I like the product but I cannot stand the smell. It has a very potent perfume smell. Other than that the product does a good job at exfoliating gently. It has micro peeling particles and vitamin E pearls that work together according to the information I read. You can use it daily. It states it provides long lasting moisturization but I couldn't tell a difference in my skin as I always have to have lotion. It may provide the moisturization I just didn't notice anything. If you don't mind strong scented products you'll probably be fine with this. Nivea Body Touch of Renewal Lathering Body Scru,Neutral
I bought this body scrub to try. I love Nivea products I have used them for years. This body scrub works well. Just after the shower I noticed my skin was very soft. The only problem I have with it is the scent. It is very strong. I have super sensitive skin and senses and most perfumes give me an instant headache. The scent of this body scrub isn't too bad but it is too strong for me. I would love to see this product in a sensitive skin version.

I have mostly thick curly unruly and easily tangled hair. I also have an autoimmune disease that requires a strong medicine and (unfortunately) hair loss is one of the side effects of this medicine. However I've been fortunate so far in that I have somewhat minor hair loss; it's noticeable to me in my part areas but not overly remarkable to others.Since I'd rather not lose *any* hair I thought I'd give this shampoo a try. After  months of use I can only say that it seems to work okay... I don't have huge amounts of regrowth in the areas where I part my hair (my problem areas) but I do notice a slight difference. This result as of  mos of use is good in my opinion!The best part of the results though is that my hair is soft shiny and much more controllable. I haven't used conditioner in almost the entire time I've been using this product and love not having to use it!The only downside in my opinion is the smell of the shampoo. While I don't like strong perfume scent in ANYthing I think this could smell a lot better than it does.Recommended!Comment Comment | Permalink Soft shiny and controllable hair!,Neutral
My daughter has hair similar to mine thick course frizzy with wave.  I control mine by flat iron or curling iron but my  year old doesn't have the patience to have her hair done before school.  I was hoping that Motions Naturally You Define My Curls would help tame her hair in the morning.  The product has a strong perfume scent which my daughter was fine with.  Our biggest problem is that it made her hair really greasy looking even with just a tiny amount on my hands.  Yes the frizz was gone but it looked like a greasy mess.  It didn't help define her wave/curls at all.  Lastly the front label mentions shea butter coconut and avocado oils but ingredients are listed last which means they are in the smallest quantities way behind one of the top ingredients mineral oil.  Still looking for the right product. Didn't work for my daughters hair,Neutral
Not only does this product work but it looks good.. the packaging I mean and the smell is clean and simple and does not clash with your perfume. Its not ugly in your bathroom with the simple calm colors of the packaging. Lovely product,Neutral
...A Gel-creme that is light which leaves hair soft and shiny. It doesn't weigh the curls down and there is NO FRIZZ. It works best for me on damp hair but is OK on dry and wet hair too. This gel-creme required a Trial & Error approach to figure out how it works for me. Although pleasant the product scent initially seemed like it would clash with my favorite perfumes but it toned down enough to co-exist nicely. I'm not sure others would agree.For my wavy curly frizzy shoulder length hair this works differently depending if my hair is:+ Wet -  just a TEENY bit on the ends carefully or it's a greasy MESS. This acts like a sealant to keep my ends moist and frizz-free as my hair air dries.+ Damp - using a dime-size amount in the palm of my hand and rubbing hands together to warm up the cr&egrave;me for better coverage before applying to the ends THEN running my fingers through the rest of my hair and proceeding with usual hair routine. Whether I air dry OR my dryer with difuser my curls are soft shiny and frizz-free!+ Dry - a little dab run through my hair and a scrunch or two restores the curl IF my hair is not too lacking in moisture like Day  post conditioning.My focus is always on my ends with MINIMAL attention to rest of the strand or my naturally oily scalp. The condition of my ends makes or breaks how my hair looks. A little dab will do you with this product because it is easier to add more vs. having a greasy mess!P.S. Motions might consider offering trials or sample packages of the ENTIRE Naturally You product line for the Curly Gurls to experiment and learn how to best use the products rather than a hit or miss with piece parts of the line.UPDATE //: I actually looked at the Amazon Motions Video for the Motions Naturally You product line to see what and HOW the professional used the product/products in Motions Naturally You line..eye opening and gave me more ideas. Trial & Error Continues...,Neutral
I will be the first one to admit that I have straight hair and no curls.  However I like to style my hair every now and then and this cream gives it a really nice definition.  I put a little bit of it at the ends and it helps me style my hair and curl it up by using a wide brush.  Cream has very pleasant smell.  So if you use a fragrant shampoo it will complement it without overwhelming.  It goes the same if you like to spray some of your favorite perfume into your hair.  You will still be able to keep your signature fragrance and have lovely curls. Hair cream,little bit
I like the texture and the motorizing effects but the fragrance is very powerful. If it's for sensitive skin then I wonder why they put fragrance in it to begin with. I can understand a bit of perfume but it's way to much in my opinion for a &#;calming&#; product. Powerful fragrance,sensitive skin
I prefer natural products in no small part because I dislike fake smelling overly perfumed products.  I was surprised at how much I disliked the scent of these -very perfume -y.I was tempted to not use them at all but I finished the package. I have no complaints with how they work just with the scent. Unfortunately that was enough of a drawback to keep me from purchasing these again. I usually like this brand so this was a surprise. HATE THE SMELL,Neutral
My problem I do not like this long lasting to me cheep smell to this line also noticed sticky on my naturally curly freeze prune dry hair in dry Colorado climate  of cause not worse spent money for me I may try it humid climates may be it will work? I think would never buy it again. Do not buy all different products of same line just try one if you like the smell unless you are not sensitive to smells my favorite perfumes are almost all Sisley parfumes currently#  if you are similar this review may be helpful. Sticky and strong unpleasant cheap smell,Neutral
Just as lovely as its other Bvlgari cousins but not my favourite. I still get compliments on it though. My advice remains the same for all perfumes; make sure to try a sample at the store if possible. Lovely,Neutral
I'm pleasantly surprised with how much I like this perfume. It reminds me of the smell of the air in the hotel in Hawaii my husband and I stayed at on our honey moon... light sweet airy a tad citrusy. The name Coral is very fitting as there is a very beachy feel to the scent yet still sweet. Coral also happens to be my favorite color but that is neither here nor there. I am giving only  stars as I personally think the bottle looks a tad cheap I think Bvlgari could have done a bit better in this area. But put that aside this perfume smells wonderful and lasts surprisingly long for an EDT. I can't believe I spend $ on this at Macy's when I could have bought it off Amazon for / the price! Lovely!,Neutral
Irish Spring has always been one of my favorite scents so much so that I wished they made a perfume or even a room spray.This is great in the shower I feel clean it's not as drying as the bar style (don't know why) doesn't leave a film and the scent stays crazy long throughout the day! DH smells fresh even after a long day at work and me I just smell my forearm frequently throughout the day to refresh myself.I wish they would make a room spray that smells exactly like this. A perfume or cologne would be cool too but I'd settle for a room spray. Love love love this!,Neutral
For some reason salons sells argan oil for a ridiculous markup. My best friend was the one who told me about it first because she had just spent $ on a little oz bottle at the salon. I tried this after googling it and found that you can buy it anywhere besides a salon and save a fortune. And this one's organic; I'm not sure if this is something that even needs to be certified organic but when I have a choice I always buy organic just in case.You have to be careful when using it in your hair because it is oil so it will make your hair oily. I find it's easiest to add  drops to my leave in conditioner/protectant I'm using as well. When my hair is dry I might do another  drops alone to settle down any fly-aways. It makes my hair SUPER soft. I also add a dropper full to my body lotion bottles and you can feel a difference after you use it. It makes a good carrier oil for essential oils if you like to use those for perfumes as it doesn't really have a smell of it's own.Overall I would definitely recommend trying it!I would definitely recommend trying it for your hair and skin. DO NOT buy argan oil at the salon!!,argan oil
it isn't a long lasting perfume Three Stars,Neutral
I am going to be  years old this December. The ladies in my family all worked in the beauty and fashion industry in one form or another so I learned many many tips. If you have a fragrance that you just love and it will not hold very long this happens with very expensive fragrances too apply the vaseline to the areas you spray or dab or perfume and it will last for days even because one application of vaseline is proven to last  days. It works with all fragrances men's and women's. The secret to amazing skin is baby oil soaked in the bath or a homemade sugar scrub in the shower made with vaseline add sugar and cinnamon oh yeah dry off wile skin is still warm apply moisturizer whichever you choose. Make that a habit and your skin will be amazing and it will hold all those perfumes too. I use the scrub on my face as well and not to brag but I will be  this year and I don't have the first line on my face or body because I've used vaseline all my life. Now I use the vaseline lotions too. makes your perfume and toilette sprays and men's fragrances too last as long as pure perfume.,Neutral
I received this seasonal version of Wen cleansing conditioner yesterday and although I haven't used it yet it smells very-very good. Its by far my favourite Wen Cleansing Conditioner and I've tried them all. The scent reminds me of perfume flowery fresh spring-ish. I can't wait to see what the summer version of Wen will smell like. Smells hevenly!,Neutral
just like everyone else says it's too powdery (like baby powder) regardless of how this seller lists the product I have used other mineral makeups and this one just doesn't match up to everything else I've used. Coverage isn't good doesn't stay on long and It has a perfumey smell too so something is amiss...not surprising since the seller I bought it from (ONSALEHRS) is a horrible seller and lied about the item being in stock when it wasn't.  Spend a few extra bucks and go buy it at Ulta or somewhere else at least you'll get a legitimate product from a store that appreciates their customer unlike the joke store on here that I bought mine from.  I use amazon all the time and literally buy almost everything on here and I'm usually very happy and satisfied with my purchases; but I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase. DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FAKE BUT IT SEEMS TOO POWDERY TO BE MINERAL ANYTHING,Neutral
I received a bottle ofCLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY  in  Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner Dry Scalp Hydration .ozandCLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY  in  Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner Clean & Refresh . Fluid Ounceat the same time.  They both do a great job and I can't tell them apart (except as shown in the video by reading the label or looking very closely at the ingredients list).Both products take only a small amount to lather nicely.  They rinse off easily and leave my hair feeling clean all day.  There is a very slight smell but it's not at all perfume-y or the least bit objectionable.I've been usingAmerican Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo .-Ounce Bottle Package may varyfor years.  However even though this stuff is a bit more expensive per ounce (maybe not so much when you figure you don't need to use much) when it comes time to buy more I'll be buying whichever of these two costs less. Very nice shampoos,Neutral
Another reviewer remarked that the bottle was leaking when it arrived.  Same with mine.  And it's a bad package design.  I don't know what other guys do with their shower products but I have a shelf in my shower that shampoo bottles and the rest go on and this is entirely too tall and top-heavy of a bottle not to fall over in that environment.  I do appreciate the one-handed snap-open lid but it needs to be on a much squatter bottle to prevent frequent falls.  I would guess it's too tall for most caddies and is not a good fit for gym bags either.So having attacked the packaging I found the scent to be pleasant and just this side of too much.  I expected an herbal smell which can range from subtle and welcome to overpowering and obnoxious.  With mint and green tea essences fighting it out in the formula the smell could have been awful.  But no it's not that obtrusive and results in a sense of freshness rather than having been heavily perfumed.The conditioner works quite well.  Because my hair can become oily over the course of a day or two I favor shampoos that are good at removing oils but the unfortunate side-effect is that stripped hair can become damaged fly-away and lifeless.  The conditioner in Clear Men is light enough to avoid adding to my greasy head woes but present enough to add a little body and manageability.I am highly doubtful that the herbs used--or indeed any herbs--are as effective a treatment for dandruff as several non-organic compounds (notably those with sulfur and zinc compounds) are but I do not have much of a dandruff problem to start with and generally only choose dandruff compounds as a preventative.  I don't know but suspect that men with really serious dandruff issues are not going to be satisfied with the treatment afforded by largely herbal therapies.  Clear Men however does contain a zinc compound that I suspect does all the anti-dandruff heavy lifting with the botanicals merely added for cache and marketing appeal.Having said that and setting aside the horrible packaging it's a perfectly acceptable shampoo and I can see myself getting it again sometime--more likely if they come up with a bottle that is less like a carrot and more like a pumpkin. Terrible packaging but OK product.,Neutral
I had the two men in my life try this one: my son () and my husband.My son doesn't have a dandruff problem but both he and my husband who occasionally has some flakes were both suffering from itchy scalps due to all the swimming they've been doing.My son really liked the shampoo.  (He used it by himself and I washed his hair a few times myself to see what it was like.)  It made good suds and he really liked the smell which he thought was 'manly but not stinky'. (I had no idea he even noticed these sorts of things. But he did say that it made him smell nice like his Uncle Marker). I liked that it suds well and washed out cleanly without a lot of whining.My husband commented that it 'soothed' his itchy scalp.  And neither of us us have seen any flakes.  HOWEVER he also commented that he didn't  think it cleaned to his complete satisfaction: at least not for Summer.  After a particularly grueling day of sitting on a lounge chair watching me mow and then weed the garden he said he had to wash through twice to get to the point where his hair felt super clean.  This is more or less the same comment he's been making about every other shampoo that he's tried lately:  Pantene Aussie and Suave.So FIVE STARS.  This is a shampoo/conditioner that is going to be good for someone who doesn't want their shampoo to dry out their hair and scalp.  It also smells night without being overly perfume-y.  It appears to be soothing to the scalp but you might find you need to use more shampoo if you have excessively greasy hair.Pam T~ Great for Normal Hair Soothing to the Scalp,Neutral
This is the third of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy products that I have tried. All use the same active ingredient Pyrithione Zinc (.%) to treat the dandruff. This shampoo seems  be a general anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner rather than one geared toward dry or oily hair or scalps.It is a good product that works well.I have also tried the  in  Dry Scalp Hydration anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner  and the Strong and Full anti-dandruff shampoo. I don't notice a whole lot of difference between them other than the perfume smell seems stronger in both shampoo and conditioners. The smell seems to go away after I am done washing my hair which is a good thing since I don't want my hair smelling sweet.You only need to use a little of this product to get your hair covered in soap. It feels fine on my scalp. It is a daily shampoo and conditioner.I had been using a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo as well as a coal tar based brand name product.  I am happy using clear men scalp therapy products.  They seem to keep my dandruff under control. Works Well,Neutral
I have used this product for about a week now and found that it does a just right job in my case.The product has a nice simple clean smell that does leave behind a strong perfume-like odor. (It seems to me that a lot of men's  shampoos these days would be better suited for women based upon the residual smell. I want to smell clean but not like I've been doused in perfume. :-) )It also seems to control the few flakes that I get from time to time.In short this product was a good fit for me; neither too much nor too little in any one area with no residual build up or over-cleaning my hair. Simple but nice product.,Neutral
My dandruff is not severe enough for me to need to use a dandruff shampoo every day. Over-the-counter products used sporadically whenever I have an outbreak are all I really need to keep my dandruff under control. My current go to product isNeutrogena T-Gel; it works Great but doesn't have a fragrance you would consider pleasant. This product seems to work almost but not quite as good and has a much more pleasant fragrance. While the fragrance is nice it doesn't really stick with your hair the way a normal perfumed shampoo would. It does however smell much better than most dandruff shampoos. Active Ingredient: Pyrithione Zinc (.%),Neutral
This shampoo comes in an ergonomically-designed bottle.  It comes tightly wrapped in Grade plastic to avoid leakage while in transit.The shampoo comes out looking like white glue and has that consistency as well while spreading on the scalp.  I liked that it didn't contain any annoying perfumes to attract insects while I'm out in the wilderness.  Nor did it create frizzy dry hair either or make my scalp itch afterwards.My only complaint?  The price!  This is great shampoo that gently cleanses the hair but it is a tad pricey.  If price isn't an issue this product will clean your hair. Gently cleans hair,Neutral
Unlike most dandruff shampoos this product has no offensive medicinal odor. In fact it has a very light pleasant fragrance which dissipates quickly and doesn't interfere with one's favorite perfume. Most importantly the product works and works well both soothing the scalp and eliminating dandruff flakes. Hair is clean shiny and manageable with no need for conditioner. One could hardly ask for a better product. Gentle effective and smells lovely,favorite perfume
The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff similar to other brands but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance texture and cleaning.FRAGRANCETypical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Complete Care) with a price between the two extremes has a floral fragrance that reminds me of cheap children's perfume.  It is not terrible but I think a simple clean smell would be much better.TEXTUREAnother review nailed the texture as melted ice cream. More importantly it lathers well and is easy to spread through even long hair.CLEANINGThis shampoo left my hair feeling clean but not stripped.  I think it works well.  It did leave my scalp a little dry though.OVERALLClear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy is an okay dandruff shampoo but does not do much to differentiate itself. Floral Dandruff Killer,Neutral
This product works better than any other product I've tried in years.  Why not a -star review?  Many companies have figured out that fragrances can be a problem for many people.  I'm one of those.  Look in the laundry detergent and fabric softener aisles at grocery stores - almost any product there these days has a fragrance-free version. I truly wish I could continue using this product and actually did continue to use it well beyond the comfort level just to make sure it works.  It really does.  But the added perfume is fairly strong and causes my usual allergic reaction to it.  If the manufacturer ever comes out with a fragrance-free variety I'm sold.  It not only stopped dandruff but scaly patches I've at best been able to limit with current and previous brands.If fragrances don't bother you and you've got dandruff and/or scaly patches get it!  For you it should be a -star product. Would be -star without the fragrance,Neutral
The Clear Men Scalp Therapy anti-dandruff shampoo is a good choice for dandruff control. I normally use Nizoral for my dandruff woes (with excellent results) but after using Clear anti-dandruff shampoo exclusively for  days my dandruff has remained in check so it definitely works. When I run out of my normal brand and have to switch to normal shampoo I'll usually start to see flakes within days but that didn't happen using this.The shampoo itself is rather thick and leaves my hair feeling great. Spearmint and tea tree oil are listed in the ingredients both of which have very distinct (and often overpowering) scents but neither is particularly noticeable here. Every now and then I'll think that I've caught a whiff of the mint or tea tree oil but in either case it's not noticeable if you're trying to find it. The scent is fresh and not overly perfumed. It does seem strong at first but it rinses away clean leaving your hair much more subtly-scented.One thing I will mention that I hope Amazon improves is the packaging for this product. It came wrapped in a plastic bag in a bubble mailer. The top basically came open during shipment leaving a good bit of the product squeezed-out into the bag. A small seal (just a bit of tape) on the edge of the top would solve this issue that or shipping it in a box. Shipping this (or any liquid product) in a bubble mailer is a bad idea evidenced by the fact that the shampoo was wrapped in plastic.Overall I like this shampoo. It's not going to replace Nizoral but since I only use that a few days a week I can see this being a go-to product in the interim. It smells good leaves hair clean and soft and keeps the flakes away. If you're reading this I'm pretty sure that's what you're looking for. Good shampoo terribly packaged for shipping...,Neutral
After using H&S; for many years I thought it was high time to try something else and see if I couldn't improve my current shampoo situation.  Clear Men Scalp Therapy sounded interesting so I figured what the heck !  You get almost  ounces in this bottle which is a bit less than my current brand.The bottle is easy to grasp and manage in the shower without becoming slippery from the water and opening is a breeze thanks to the push down lid.  I found that while the consistency of this shampoo seemed a bit thin to me very little was actually needed to achieve a full head of suds and to clean my overly oily hair and scalp.After using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for  days I can happily report at least the same dandruff reducing results as I got my my mainstay Head and Shoulders. But since the shampoo is apparently more concentrated I used less and it actually rinsed out faster.The shampoo left my hair feeling totally clean with no trace of any sort of residue other than the scent which is not overblown.  I am a bit surprised by other Amazon reviews stating it leaves a bad residue and has a very heavy scent. I wonder if perhaps the quality and type of the water has something to do with all of this? We have VERY hard water here by the way. I can honestly say it rinsed clean for me and I didn't smell like I had fallen into a vat of perfume.Also it was immediately apparent that rather than standing straight up and sticking out at odd angles my hair seemed very relaxed and symmetrical before combing.  I have NO idea why but it does for me anyway.  If I can consistently find this brand at the same price I may seriously consider using it full time and retiring the old H&S; once and for all.Everyone has different tastes and while I really LIKE this shampoo others may not. As with everything TRY one bottle and if you like it great if not you are only out  bucks and can chalk it up to experience. As for me I am pretty likely to purchase a few more bottle once this starts running out. Helps Me Manage Hard to Tame Hair,Neutral
I am looking to replace my store brand dandruff shampoo and my coal tar shampoo with something that will work better and be cheaper.  I am looking for a basic dandruff shampoo without a lot of extras. I tried the  in  Dry Scalp Hydration version of this brand which I like but I liked the name of this so I figured Iwould give it a try.I am pleased so far. This seems to be keeping my dandruff under control without having to use a second product. The perfume like smell in many shampoos which I don't like is not as strong as I thought it would be and after I am done washing my hair I don't notice any lingering smell. A little of this product goes a long way.Interestingly both this and the   in  Dry Scalp Hydration version of this this brand use the same active ingredient Pyrithione Zinc (.%) to treat the dandruff. I have not looked at the other ingredients but the the  in  shampoo is also a conditioner while this one says it is just a  dandruff shampoo.The web page on Amazon says under directions that this product should be used twice a week but the bottle says to use it daily. I have used it daily.So far I am pleased with this. If I can use this instead of my two other shampoos I will save money as well.  I like it a bit better than the  in  Dry Scalp Hydration version of this brand but both are fine. Simple Shampoo that Works Well,Neutral
I have tried several of these Clear Men shampoos and like the results on me.  The perfume is subtle--not strong at all--and the cleaning results are postive.  While other stronger anti-dandruff shampoos leave my hair dry and frizzy this product does not.  In fact I find combing my hair afterwards smoother than had I used a non-dandruff shampoo with conditioner.I would recommend this product for someone who wants to give their hair a break with a less abrasive product.  I feel no itchiness or oiliness with this shampoo.But the price is steep for the . ounces. Another very good product,Neutral
My husband doesn't always know what he likes but he's pretty certain what he doesn't like. He's been using the same brand of anti-dandruff shampoo for years and when I got a bottle of H&S; for him it went unused until I told my son he could take it. Of course he says Shampoo is shampoo. and doesn't realize how picky he really is.So I got this with my fingers crossed. He has mild dandruff that is controlled easily with standard anti-dandruff formulations. He prefers -in- formulas since he doesn't use conditioners when he shampoos his hair. His chosen brand of anti-dandruff shampoo was out of stock last time we bought shampoo for him so he's been using a regular -in- for the last  weeks.He likes the scent of this the mint smells strongly but doesn't have a lot of tingle when you're shampooing. I checked his hair after he got home from work and it's flake-free. It's also very soft and doesn't smell perfumed just smells clean. It also feels a bit fuller but not too full. He has a thick head of hair he has thinned when it's cut to help it lay right. So the fullness wasn't so much that it messed up his usual hair style.He's happy with it and it is a brand he's willing to use in the future. He still says Shampoo is shampoo. but the fact he plans to use the bottle and it works on his dandruff and makes his hair soft makes it a winner. It works smells good and my husband likes it,Neutral
Why buy all those little bottles with the pump on top when you can buy one of them and then just refill them?  I love this scent it is so calming and pleasant smell.  Even my husband and son think it is a pleasant smell and not like perfume.  It seems to soothe the skin on my hands as well as I wash them umpteen times a day! Favorite hand soap,Neutral
I was vey disappointed in this product especially with all the other positive reviews of it.  I cannot believe that anyone would want to use the product I received.  It seemed to me just like an alcohol based hair spray with an added perfume overlay.  The smell was very strong unpleasant and overpowering to me.  The product itself when used as directed did not seem to do anything it stated on the bottle. It did not make my fuller did not hold under humid conditions and made my hair feel stiff and sticky then made it feel dirty later in the day or the next morning.  I feel like the other positive reviewers were using an entirely different product from what I received.  I had to throw mine away after giving a good try over several days.  You could take any hairspray and spray it on your hair before blowdrying and get just as good results if not better.  And this stuff isn't cheap either.  I would definitely recommend against anybody buying this product.  It was a complete waste of money for me and I usually do not feel this strongly about a product.  Never had this experience before when buying on amazon and I shop a lot on here. Terrible,Neutral
OK I'm new to the phero field but have quickly become a huge fan of LP Perfumes.  With that being said I have been trying several of the pheromone lines for fun both in unscented and perfume blends.  I've quickly become a believer in the &#;science&#; behind these only because I do see and feel the effects on myself and others.  La Femme Mystere is a great phero to use if you are like me &#;new&#; to their use and application. It's great combining with other scents for the workplace or in social situations where you want to exude confidence and feminity. One of my favorites in the Love Potion Phero line...,Neutral
I have this in an alcohol spray which I use over my perfume oils. I find no scent discernible from the product itself. I really love this it adds a little something to any day any occasion. I have found it creates friendly effects with a little awe/admiration thrown in but not in a way that is overly scary/dominant. Like 'I want to worship you because you are amazing'. A good scent to wear if you wish to ask someone to do something for you of course you may not even need to ask! Perfect finishing touch!,Neutral
THIS...is one amazing unscented Phero blend! I have tried many of Love Potion' s Phero blends and speaking from my own experience this one qualifies as something akin to magic in a bottle. I wore this one on a very special evening out and experienced the most incredible reactions from people. Male and female social and attraction wise. I am by no means full of myself and this one did in no way make me feel full of myself but I *did* experience a level of confidence and even blisffulness with this blend that gave me a much needed ego boost. I found myself VERY well received by all those I encountered and especially nice it seemed to make those around me feel the same sort of blissfulness that I felt. I am not one who is receptive to placebo suggestion so it is the real thing as far as I am concerned. It truly does lend an air of mystique and attraction and positive feelings. I would merely suggest that you choose a compatable scent to wear it with well. The night I am referring to I chose a very exotic perfume to wear it with and they seemed to act as catalysts to each other's properties. Bottom line. I KNOW this works and I hope they never discontinue it!!! LPMP has some incredible pheros but they really knocked it out of the park with this one. Excellent! Simply Mystifying! Can Not Say Enough!,Neutral
La Femme Mystere (LFM) is the first pheromone I ever tried. It was in a perfume Goddess of the Blue Moon that I purchased here on Amazon from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie. This was a beautiful fragrance and I was glad to get a second bottle before it sold out.But I'm here to talk about this pheromone so let's do it...I had done a little research on pheros before my first purchase mostly at first for safety some companies are pretty shady. I found this small boutique business which made excellent perfumes and sell some containing pheromone blends. I gave them a try with my first purchases through Amazon. The first thing I noticed with LFM are the self effects. I felt very feminine and a bit sexyit just gave me a lift in general. All throughout the day interactions with people store clearksfriends and my kids doctor went over well. There was just this added something..conversations lasted longer and  everyone was so friendly and chatty. After a lively talk with my kids doctor we hugged ....It hit me as we left the office..I'm thinking WTH. I wondered if he thought the same thing. It felt natural at the time but afterwards my son says wow didn't know you were good friends 'LOL I think that's what's known as a hit'I don't wear pheromone products everyday but I do enjoy the self effects of LFM when I do. The social effects and reactions range from the more obvious ( as described) to more subtle. One important note on pheromones you don't just put a Phero on and say ok go...come get me. The pheromones accentuate give you a boost. You have to bring something to the party.This Phero has NO odor. I believe another reviewer confused pheromones and couplins they get grouped together but are not the same thing.You can wear this unscented blend with your favourite fragrance. As with anyone New to pheromones I recommend you do your own research.Try this business' website to get started. I find this a reliable reputable small business with quality products. End Of Review.I do want to mention here that I don't often review It generally takes time I don't have. I among others came to show support for a small business I adore and trust. I gave my honest review and Amazon's verified purchase. I believe everyone's entitled to their opinion but I also believe there's some odd activity perhaps a competitors compulsion or someone more interested in trolling than doing their own homework. Since my original purchases here I have purchased from LOVEPOTIONMAGICKALPERFUMERIE many times. This small american business has a devoted clientele in the US and abroad. The fact that this business has a loyal clientele speaks well for its reputation. I'd invite anyone curious to check their website and see for themselves. My favorite,Neutral
This pheromone is my evening go to. I just love how calming it is. It helps with stressful situations and makes your night very relaxing. It also helps me with my PMS. If I could buy this in gallons I would!This pheromone is also in the perfume Heart's Ease! Calming and relaxing,Neutral
I have found this unbelievable for calming decompressing.  I loved this so much in the Heart's Ease perfume (also available from this seller) that I ordered this as the stand alone phernomes.  Both are essential must haves for me.I have found this great for PMS.  I have also found this great for stress.  A quick dab on my pillow before bed is great when I am out of sorts. Stress? PMS?,Neutral
This product is colorless and odorless and will not stain clothing.  Between - sprays of this will have a calming effect.  I like to use it when I'm hormonal or am stressed to the maximum and need to take a few steps back and chill out. I find that it helps calm me in tense interactions where there is conflict.  I've even spritzed some on when embarking on a busy day of meetings errands and general running around while under a deadline.  It produces a general sense of calm and well being.  Love Potion perfumery is a quality company with a  wonderfully helpful staff and beautifully crafted scents.  There is a blend for everyone there. Stressed out?  Use a bit of Balm Bom,Neutral
I actually need to wear this more often. I tend to put this on when I knowI have a long evening in and I want to decompress after a long day/week andjust chill in my jammies.Great to layer with other perfumes and that makes me happy because I feel likedifferent scents before bedtime.I've tried this in Heart's Ease as well and found that useful especially whenI was doing Yoga to just zone out and live in the moment of breathing butI like having the unscented version better.I also find some of the beta-nol mixes very calming for bed as well but this ismore of an I'm awake but just want to chill while I putter around my house surroundedby candles reading a romance novel mix but it makes a pretty good I want to crawl intobed and just ooze out all the stress right before falling asleep. I like this one a lot!,Neutral
If you've read any of my other reviews you'll know I'm addicted to this company and their perfumes! This is one of my favorites. It smells like sweet chocolate honey. I just want to roll in it! Makes my hubby want to cuddle if you know what I mean ;) Yummy!,Neutral
Normally I'm not a huge fan of chocolate or honey scents as they do not do well with my skin chemistry but this one is blended to perfection. The honey is toned down with the chocolate and I think it works so well because it has that twinge of spiciness that covers up those notes that usually do not do well on me... Truly if you have ever been afraid to try a chocolate / honey blend this is the one to take a chance on... This perfume is one that you can wear to work or out to play and the peach note adds that grown up feel to this blend what are you waiting for GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!! Pouncing Potion,Neutral
I love pherogirl. This reminded me a lot of pherogirl but different. It wasn't until I read people's reviews here that I could identify the peach. It does smell like canned peaches in syrup. A little tinny something a little more sugary than syrup-y peaches a lot of honey or powdery honey with a bit of cocoa powder.I don't mind the smell. I kind of like it. Not nearly as much as pherogirl but enough to dig using the sample up.However from now on I'm going to have to let the perfume dry for like + minutes before putting clothes on because otherwise my boyfriend says I smell very very icky. So be sure to let it dry while you're doing your makeup hair or whatnot. I like the company's similar perfumes but not this one.,Neutral
I received this as a sample from LP Perfumes and from the moment I tried it on I knew that going to sleep would never be the same again. I'm so comforted from the moment that I put it on. I have very vivid sweet dreams and now I'm not sure if I could go to sleep without it. I will be ordering a full bottle of this. Heavenly sweet dreams!,Neutral
I reach for this perfume for bed time. It is so soothing and perfect to help you unwind and relax in the evening. Pillowy marshmallow and soft licorice is what I mainly smell. Perfect for sleep! Sogni Incantati,Neutral
As a certified addict of bedtime perfumes and also speaking as someone who struggles to unwind for bed I have to say this is the business. I don't really like licorice in perfume but this works. It's sweet comforting and does actually make me feel sleepy. bedtime bliss,Neutral
I've been trying this one for awhile.  It's a very light scent so you won't feel as if you are lying in a cloud of perfume at bedtime.  Predominantly the scent comes across as a very fluffy marshmallow spiced with sweet licorice.  The licorice is not strong as you might suspect.  It blends very nicely and doesn't overpower the creamy feel of the marshmallow. It's a sweet and comforting smell so I have no doubt that this is one that can make you fall asleep quickly.  I can't really say much on that subject because I can fall asleep in front of my computer if given the opportunity so sleep is not a problem... ever.Unfortunately for me benzoin tends to smell a little medicinal and even in small amounts on my skin I still get a slight bite of that note. This is a very nice perfume but one that I will have to pass on in the future because my skin chemistry throws it off a bit. I do believe though that a majority of others don't find benzoin to be a problem so I would never have a problem recommending this to anyone that wanted a relaxing bedtime scent. Great for Marshmallowy Dreams,Neutral
This is a beautifully crafted artisan scent. The soft fragrance of the marshmallow combined with the warm vanilla presents a soft bed for the rest of the scent notes to float on. I think the benzoin and anisette give off a soft hint of licorice ( it's not a hard note).There is definitely a tranquil quality to this fragrance. A great scent for going out or going to bed.Sweet soft and slightly perfume'ish.I love this Boho Cats collection from Love Potion both the fragrances and the bottle labels are a delight to own. A tranquil sweet dream,Neutral
When they say that pumpkin and ginger are two of the most compelling scents to menthey aren't kidding! My husband LOVES it when I wear this perfume;I can hardly wear it or we won't make it out of the house ;)It really does smell just like a yummy frosted ginger spiced pumpkin cookiebut Don't lick it lol! Pumpkin & ginger oh my!,Neutral
This is a spicy pumpkin & ginger fragrance that never fails to earn compliments. One of my early Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie purchases.This scent got me hooked! I think another reviewer said a pumpkin gingery cookie. Yes! I agree. A little spicy and sweet. You will have people nuzzling up close to reach the source of this sexy foodie scent.I love the label on this bottle. A beautiful artisan print to go with a delightfully unique artisan fragrance.A wonderful addition to my perfume collection. A Delish Fragrance,Neutral
Velvet and Steel... a titillating elixir of summery scents (coconut pineapple) cool green (bamboo) and sexiness (musk and vanilla) that will lift your spirits and give you a sexy edge that everyone around you will notice.  This is a fantastic scent that could be combined with any number of the Love Potion Unscented Pheromones for the effects you need/want  You WILL get compliments when you wear this one... remember this line:  &#;What are you wearing that smells so good!?&#;  I hear that almost on a daily basis now because of the incredible fragrances I've discovered from Love Potion Magikal Perfumerie.  Plus they have wonderful customer service... free shipping on many things and free samples with every order.  Items may take a little longer to ship but it so SO worth the wait.  These are not commercial-department store-mass produced-nasal burning colognes that cause you to smell like everyone else - these are signature scents that meld with your own chemistry... they will set you apart (assuming you like that kind of attention!) I'd give this company  stars if I could. The name says it ALL,Neutral
i love this regenerist cream and am THRILLED it is finally available in fragrance free (the fragrance in the other version is just yucky).  my husband has even been known to dip in and use this on his face.  good moisturizer and no cloying scent to fight with your perfume. very happy,Neutral
I saw this on Dr Oz as a good moisturizer at a decent price and have been using it for over  months and have found a few lines to have decreased and keeps my skin well hydrated. No need for the very expensive products he said and for me he was right. I like this no perfume one. It is also cheaper on amazon. Love this,Neutral
I really wanted to like this since it is % organic but it broke out my face and made my pores look larger than normal. Other reviewers have commented on the scent and it smells like my grandma's cheap perfume. The scent goes away after a while and it wasn't bothersome to me after about  minutes. I will use it on other parts of my body but not my face. :( Not good for my face :(,Neutral
I bought this from a grocery store a few weeks ago.  I've used it several times.  All but one time I was very pleased with the results and the way my hair was once dry.  But I am finding it really difficult getting used to the fact that it is a lotion and does not have the normal surfactant sudsing properties most shampoos have.  Surprised this is not being mentioned in the reviews.  I almost threw it out but after purchasing a different shampoo and conditioner and using them a couple of times with only mediocre results I was reminded just how well this cleans and conditions the hair.  I think I'll hang onto it but use it intermittently.  As I mentioned earlier the one time that I was not happy with it I think I might have not rinsed it out thoroughly enough and also using it back-to-back four washings in a row... well I think that was a bit much conditioning.  So...Pros:Cleans and conditions hair very well.  Leaves hair soft and somehow tames flyaways.  Hair has body and is not weighed down like you'd think it might be.  Good results whether letting hair mostly air-dry or taking the time to style and blow-dryI like the scent.  Hard to describe.  Smells like a salon brand shampoo not your average supermarket perfumed oneEnds the need for spray detanglers/leave-in conditioners.  Hair combs easily.  (My hair happens to be very fine and always tangles after washing and I have to be super careful I don't pull out too much hair when combing it wet but this product really minimizes this significantly)Cons:Feels really weird applying it directly on the scalp (and all over) with its thick lotion consistency.  Doesn't foam up at all so psychologically you feel like you're not getting the hair clean (it's like a thick conditioner not at all like a shampoo)I wouldn't recommend using it day after day every wash.  It can leave hair with a bit of build-up and if not properly washed out can be greasy lookingUpdate: I've now decided that using it frequently means over-conditioning the hair and it ends up getting greasy looking faster than with other shampoos.  And on my very fine blonde hair it weighs it down.  It's not because of lack of rinsing.  I'm very careful about that now.  It's just too heavy for fine hair I believe.  I still think it might work for those who don't want to condition their hair every time they wash.  If you use this on those condition days it might work out very well.  But not for every use. I miss the lather,Neutral
I like this dry shampoo fairly well but I do not think it is a good value. I have dark hair and the Dark and Deep Brown color is undetectable in my hair unlike white powder dry shampoos I've used in the past. My main complaint is that despite shaking the can well before each use only the first / of the can was effective. The last / of the can did not effectively absorb the oil from my hair. In addition the can did not last as long as I thought it would. I used this product once sometimes twice per week just on my bangs and the front of my hair and the can only lasted about  weeks.People have raved about the scent which I personally did not care for much. It smells like Burberry Brit so if you like that perfume you'll probably like this.I will try other products before I purchase this again. It works but I felt like I was throwing away / of the purchase price. For as often as I would need to reorder this product it just doesn't feel like a good buy. Works Okay Runs Out Quickly,Neutral
Great dry shampoo! My one tiny complaint is that Batiste should give a description of the scent. I honestly ordered this one because of the leopard print bottle. I kept my fingers crossed on the fragrance. Lucky me it smells nice. It has a similar smell to Angel perfume but not quite as strong. The smell stays with you all day so if you aren't a fan pick a different fragrance. This product leaves my hair refreshed with some volume for the days I skip washing. I have since bought another bottle in a different fragrance a girl can't have just one. Love it!,Neutral
I love this brand but do not buy Paisley! It smells terrible and will give you a headache. Super strong perfumed scent that I cannot deal with. Hate to waste it but it smells really bad. I recommend the original fresh scent and blush. love batiste...,Neutral
I thought this was % argan oil but I guess I bought the wrong item on Amazon. This stuff is full of silicone which is bad for the environment and also for your hair. The smell is way too sweet I feel like I wear a heavy perfume. Wish I could replace this with some natural product. full of silicone,argan oil
I expected better. This stuff smells so cheap. A few whiffs make you feel like you've been smothered with gardenias. Reminds me of the uber-cheap Gloria Vanderbilt perfume sets from the s. An ex gave me a set for Christmas one year (because it was under $ for the whole set) and it was SO sweet it almost put me into insulin shock. I'm sorry I thought Madonna would TRY something seductive. This is an epic fail. Sickeningly Sweet,Neutral
Not a Madonna fanand not a fan of buying very expensive (celebrity) perfume (unless it's designer perfume Dior Versace etc).... But I just had to have it once I smelled it! I love the bottle and the smell! I couldn't resist paying regular price for it and I even got a cute little Madonna bag with it! Love this smell!!,Neutral
Usually tuberose and neroli are two of the worst notes on my skin so I tried this perfume expecting to hate it.On my skin I get tuberose which is sweetened up by the amber and musk. This is a scent which has to be on the skin for awhile before all the base notes really mix well with the potent tuberose.The sillage of this perfume is high and lingering. So put this on with a light hand. The lasting power of this EDP is amazing. It lasts all day long with only one spray.This EDP reminds me very much of Versace's Blonde and Guerlain's Mahora yet it's just a bit different than both of them with the more creamy ambery base. It's basically a tuberose gourmand.I can definitely see Madonna's Italian roots when I smell this perfume. I can just picture Venice and Tuscany when I smell this. I think Madonna did a good job on this one. I don't care who's name is on a perfume if you like it wear it!This won't become my favorite scent but I can see myself growing very fond of it.Truth or Dare fragrance notes: The scent is both a light and dark opening with notes of gardenia creamy tuberose and neroli. The heart consists of jasmine benzoin and white lily based on vanilla absolute caramelized amber and sensual musk. Amazingly long lasting EDP a tuberose gourmand,Neutral
to me this was very strong perfume It will remind you of your grandmother not for me. The scent also lasts very long and have me a headache. Not a good scent,Neutral
Though I think that I'm fairly neutral on this scent (I got it for dirt cheap and won't be wearing it often but I won't be donating it to the local thrift store either...) I really think that this one is either love it or hate it. Truth or Dare is a very mature scent but there's something nostalgic and emotionally evoking about it. It's not quite old lady or moth balls but I can definitely see how younger buyers will not exactly be enticed or excited about this.The vanilla does not stand out as a note of its own (typically true vanilla is more like Tonka- it's earthy and does not add overt sweetness to a blend) but FOR some reason contributes to Truth or Dare's overtly sweet quality. Let's talk about the sweetness: this perfume is not only sweet but cloyingly (CLOYINGLY) sweet. It's like candy and is almost foodie in its quality. Gardenia on its own tends to lend to the sugary side smell wise so the combination is sugary city. This is a good thing or a bad thing depending on your scent preferences.Overall I find this scent to be okay (it smells okay enough...for me casually) but I would not recommend it AT ALL if you do not care for gardenia. Gardenia and sweetness= this scent in a nutshell. It's fairly simple and straightforward. Those expecting this perfume to evolve on the skin will be disappointed.I think Truth or Dare's audience will be + (and if I'm not mistaken I'm pretty sure that Madonna had a certain age demographic in mind when she concocted this...and it was not meant for teens and tweens). By all means teens can wear this if they wish but I just don't see them liking it as it lacks the fruity tart light fun feel that many youthful scents offer.All in all it's just okay. I can see gardenia lovers loving this; I can also see the floral hater HATING this.My best advice is to get a sample before you buy a bottle. Though I must say the bottle is very attractive!!! It's fitting for a Madonna scent as it has a church quality to it; very ornamental and beautiful for display. Gardenia Gardenia....and more SWEET Gardenia.,Neutral
I hate when i experiment when new things even though I know a great product for my hair and it is cheaper than this or at least from the store I shop it is. Anyway I knew from the moment i opened the jar this stuff would be crap. and it is CRAP. I was putting in about  big twist in my hair when i got to twist number  I had to stop using this crap. The stuff only coatsso once it dries I knew my hair would feel like straw. Now granted I didn't add a little water to my hairlike I normally do but once I did add some water it felt worse. The stuff has a strong smell. Some females might like the smell but I am not into all the perfume scented crap. Keep it simple. so now I am mad because i have a big jar of crap that I don't plan to use ever again unless I combine it with something else which i hate to do. In case your wondering I have C hair so maybe for girls with c or c it might work. I am mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am very pissed right now,great product
I love this scent. I first received it as a gift and just ordered some more of it. I do use it as a body spray and have just recently began using it as a hair perfume. It is hard to find anything that smells this good for your hair! And it is just wonderful. Highly recommend this scent and will continue using it every day. Great As a Hair Perfume,Neutral
Switched from &#;Ultimate Anew Day Cream&#; and am enjoying the improvement I've seen on my complexion to even smoother and more evenly toned plus the fragrance is much softer and pleasing so that it's not assulting your sinus's as well as clashing with any perfumes you may wear... Glad I made the switch! Effective!,Neutral
This review is going to be the same for the corresponding conditioner as I received both at the same time to try out. Since I can't (more won't) use each individually to see their own merits because it'll play havoc with my hair the review is going to be for the both of them.OK. First things first. This produces a lot of lather which I discovered when I had to clean off the shampoo bottle that had leaked during travel. This is nice since I like lather but I want to note that hair cleansing products do not need to produce bubbles in order to work. (Very few need to produce bubbles and bubbles/lather is actually from additional bits that have been added to make it look like it's working. Old trivia factoid.) If you're one of the people who dislike having a lot of lather be prepared for this. (I know that there are people out there like this.)The shampoo and conditioner smell pretty nice which is a bonus. I've smelled some shampoos that either don't have much of a scent or they're so overwhelming that no amount of other bonuses can make up for the perfume stench. Clear's scent is neither under or overwhelming. You can smell it if you stick your nose into the washed hair or right after you've used it but it's not going to be smelled across the room.What I really liked was that this didn't weight my hair down overly much. My hair feels nice and soft without feeling heavy or greasy. I'm pretty finicky about shampoo/conditioner products since many will either undercondition (making me look like a brown haired Little Orphan Annie) or they'll undercondition and I'll end up with hair that looks lank and greasy. (I've been pretty happy with my Garnier Nutrisse products for the most part although lately it feels like they've changed the formula slightly.) What I also liked is that after using the combo a few times I don't get a weird buildup feeling to my hair.I rather like this overall. I'm still not sure if I'd overall replace my normal shampoo and conditioner but I'm willing to give this a longer trial period. I've already purchased more of this product with my own money so I suppose that this is as good of a recommendation as any. I like it,Neutral
Texture is good smell is a bit strong for me (like perfume). Cleans well but the conditioner doesn't feel like it rinses out fully. My hair feels a bit heavy/oily after use. A Decent Shampoo,Neutral
This shampoo cleans well and leaves your hair soft but I can't discern any difference between this and most other shampoos on the market.  It has a light pleasant scent -- not too perfumey -- and it lathers well.  I would use it again but it's nothing to get super-excited about. Good But Nothing Special,Neutral
I was able to try the Total Care shampoo through the Vine Voice promotion. I only mention this because the method of shipping for Vine Voice promotional products is sometimes different than when the item is ordered normally and because my only problem with the product involves the container.The shampoo had been slightly crushed in the mail and had opened and leaked in the bag. Normally I would tell customers to ask for a box from customer support. However after I cleaned up the bottle there was still a problem.  The shampoo bottle is flat on the top and on the bottom. I stored the bottle upside down in my shower caddy. The flip top lid doesn't seem to hold a seal when upside down and small amounts of shampoo seep through the edges of the top. Stored right side up this is not a problem. And I am not sure if this bottle defect is a result of the crush in the mail.So I am a little cautious about recommending the bottle.  I can however recommend the shampoo itself without hesitation.The shampoo has a light fragrance. It smells fresh and clean without too much perfume. It rinses clean.The essential oils in the shampoo also leave your hair shiney and sleek. The shampoo contains Sunflower seed oil sweet almond oil soybean oil coconut oil and aloe extract.I am very happy with the shampoo but I would be a little wary of the shipping method and the bottle. Clean Hair Poor Container,Neutral
The Good Stuff:The container is nice dispenses well. The color is pale lavender. Whatever.The product itself is very creamy and light and has a whitish color before you apply it to your hair. It then lathers very well especially in soft water. I had a -day dirty head so this worked very well on my hair and cleansed it without stripping it or making it feel dry.I dried and styled my hair like always yet it was more manageable than normal and did not have any frizz or stick out hairs. I liked that part.Here's the Bad Stuff:Woah that is some flowery perfume-y strong scent! I rinsed my hair extremely well (hoping most of that scent would leave) and it still smelled VERY strong after towel and blow drying it. This might be OK for some ladies but this particular guy does not appreciate smelling like he just wallowed in the perfume display at Nordstrom.As well there seems to be a slight residue after a few hours especially the next morning. (And I had to throw my pillowcase in the laundry it smelled just as strong.)All in all not a bad product for your hair per se but it's one that consumers should probably not buy unless they love smelling like a giant room freshening wick.+ stars for what it did to my hair - star for what it did to my nose. Strong in  Different Ways,Neutral
Well this shampoo is great.  First it smells really nice without being overly perfumed.  Second it lathers very well in my very thick hair.  Third it cleans my very oily hair without overdrying.  Lastly it leaves my hair looking very silky.  I have noticed a slight improvement in my dermatitis so that is an added benefit.  I got this bottle for free but I will buy one when it runs out.  And lest you wonder why I knocked off a star...it is because I am not a big fan of the spout and shape of the bottle.  It is a little akward to open and squeeze. Silky smooth hair,Neutral
First of all this review is for the shampoo only (the colored/damaged hair version). I purchased this because I read an article in a magazine that said that normal shampoos/shampooing doesn't clear the hair follicles of dead skin cells and sebum clogging them and making it more challenging for hair to grown long and strong. I have long naturally curly blonde hair that I color dark brown and straighten daily. It is about  inches past my clavicle and I have been trying to grow it past my breasts ala Kim Kardashian for what seems like years. I had beautiful long hair as a teen but since being in my adult years just can't seem to get past this length where it ends right around my underarms.I have been using this shampoo for a little over a week (probably around  days) and can honestly say I am VERY impressed. I am someone who has always believed that shampoo doesn't really matter in comparison to a good rich conditioner. Well I was wrong. I massage this shampoo into my roots in a circular motion with my fingertips being sure to reach all of my scalps and taking around - minutes to do my whole head before rinsing. I am using my usual conditioner (Tresseme Soft and Silky) which I always use. My hair feels incredibly soft and shiny and actually appears to be stronger as I don't have as many stray hairs all over my bathroom after styling. My root area has more volume than usual and my hair just feels cleaner overall than normal.The next test is to see if it starts to accelerate in growth which will probably not be visible for a little while. Meanwhile I am going to switch to the Clear conditioner too once my Treseme is gone. This will be the first shampoo that I ever re-purchase out of loyalty. As for the scent it is fine...not too floral or strong. It really just has that typical clean shampoo smell. My boyfriend likes it which is great because he only seems to like very clean scents. However if you are particularly sensitive to heavy scents you may want to steer clear of this as it is definitely perfumed.Another nice thing I noted is that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is listed fairly towards the end of the ingredient list unlike most shampoos that list it right after water (like the V I usually use).Overall I am happy with this product and will continue to use it. I am also going to monitor my hair growth to see if this will help my healing my scalp.**update**I finished my bottle today roughly  days after I wrote this review and noticed that my hair does seem longer by about an inch. Obviously I cant be % sure since I didn't measure it before starting to use this shampoo but if I noticed it that alone is a big deal as my hair grows very slowly. I will definitely re-purchase! Excellent Shampoo love it!,Neutral
I love the way this shampoo makes my scalp and hair feel.  My hair feels fuller bouncier (is that a word) and my scalp isn't as itchy.It is a creamy shampoo and lathers very well rinses out easily leaving my hair feeling extra-clean.I am just using the shampoo and not the conditioner.  I have fairly short highlighted hair and the shampoo itself seems to moisturize my hair just fine.The only downside for me is the fragrance.  Even though it smells very good I am sensitive to odors and the perfumed fragrance is a bit strong. More good hair days,Neutral
I have persistent dry scalp so I'm always looking for products to help with this.  I use a tar based shampoo part of the time but don't want to use it daily.  The Clear Scalp and Hair shampoo works fine - my hair is clean soft and my scalp is not itchy after using it.  But it has a perfume-y scent that I don't care for.  I will not be buying it again because of that.  Perhaps a scent-free shampoo could be developed? Works well strong scent,Neutral
The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff similar to other brands but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance texture and cleaning.FRAGRANCETypical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Dry Scalp) with a price between the two extremes has a floral fragrance that reminds me of cheap children's perfume and lingers all day. It is not terrible but I think a simple clean smell would be much better.  The Clear Men shampoos have a nicer smell which would work well for both men and women.TEXTUREThe texture is much like lotion but it lathers well.CLEANINGThe shampoo left my hair feeling clean but it might be a bit heavy for some people.  It reminds me of a shampoo+conditioner.OVERALLClear Scalp & Hair Dry Scalp shampoo is a good shampoo for women who have very dry hair.  It would be particularly valuable during the winter.  Apart from the cheap floral fragrance I think it is a good value. Heavy Floral Shampoo,Neutral
Functionally this is a pretty good shampoo. It cleaned my hair without stripping it down to squeaky nothing it didn't make my sensitive skin break out in any sort of rash and it did seem to reduce the dry-skin-itchiness that i get on my scalp in the summer.The only complaint i have about it is the scent. It has a sort of generic middle-tier-department-store-perfume-counter-medley smell. A little floral a little fruity totally non-specific and a little cloying. It didn't really stick though so at least i didn't feel like i was walking around wearing cheap perfume all day. Cleans well but i didn't much care for the scent,sensitive skin
I've been using this for about a week along with theCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner . Fluid Ounce. I have dry color-treated blonde hair. I've always used moisturizing shampoos and conditioners thinking my hair was dry not paying attention to my scalp. My head has been itching less using these products. Other than this I can't tell much difference in the way my hair looks or behaves. Also the fragrance is way too strong but I'm super-sensitive to perfumey scents in products. Takes away the itchies,Neutral
Like most women I'm always on the lookout for that next really great beauty product whether it be a cosmetic a perfume or a hair product. One of the basics for me is having healthy pretty hair. When I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo I was intrigued. The name implies something very basic and healthy without too many chemicals.When it arrived I was disappointed to find that it had not been packaged well. Where the conditioner (which was sent in a separate package) had the dispenser taped down and the entire bottle wrapped in plastic the shampoo was merely wrapped in plastic. Without the tape holding the dispenser closed the shampoo leaked all in the plastic during shipping. On a good note the plastic wrapping proved good enough to contain the leakage so that it didn't even touch the cardboard box.When I removed the plastic I was immediately stunned at the pungent perfume smell of the leaked shampoo. I had expected something light and `clear' and not this heavy perfume stench. Once I finished washing the bottle off the scent stayed on my hands for hours afterwards lasting through several thorough hand washings. For someone like me who prefers most products to be unscented this was a huge turnoff.Although the shampoo has a heavy perfume scent it isn't quite as bad when used in the hair as it had been when it was leaked out of the bottle. It is still a stronger scent than I like but not as bad as I feared.The shampoo washes fine but I have to say that it doesn't do any better than the Pantene Shampoo that I have used for some time. It also doesn't seem to make any difference in my hair's volume than my Pantene offers.Once this bottle is finished I will return to Pantene. I prefer it's lighter fresh scent and am very satisfied with how it cleans my hair. 'Clean' shampoo has a pungent perfume scent works OK as a shampoo,Neutral
This is a decent shampoo. However it is not clear; it is milky. It is heavily fragranced with that fruity floral beloved of pretty much all drugstore shampoos--why? It left my hair feeling coated and silky--like I'd used a combination shampoo+conditioner--which is a scary thing to a person with fine thin limp hair such as might be expected to choose a volumizing root boost shampoo. I cannot imagine who would use the matching conditioner.That said my jaw-length hair is not weighed down and I didn't use or need to use any extra conditioning product either. It is overly fragrant with a girly teen kind of fragrance.Of course it's stupid concept to begin with--the only way to nourish your hair or scalp is by eating good food. You can condition it which is what this does well enough. I might buy it again if it just weren't so perfumed!! If I got a migraine I'd need to wash my hair! I expected something well Clear,Neutral
I have bought volumizing shampoos and they have left my hair feeling dull and heavy. This one didn't do that. My hair felt clean and refreshed after shampooing with this. I really like the scent it does not have too strong a perfume smell but a clean and fresh smell. I didn't notice any extra volumizing than normal however. Nice scent and not heavy,Neutral
I have fine medium length hair and normally use a very mild shampoo that cleans well without drying my hair out followed by a good Rinse-Out conditioner. My favorite shampoos are Paul Mitchell's Shampoo One and Pantene Pro-V for Fine Hair Volume Shampoo. They wash really clean and leave my hair nice and bouncy. I couldn't wait to try this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo. What everyone wants who has fine hair is body at the roots. They list a lot of vitamins in this shampoo for your scalp that sound great too.When this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo arrived it was sealed in a plastic bag inside of a bubble wrap envelope. The bag was soaked through in both the bubble envelope and the inner plastic sealed bag. When I opened it up to see what was the problem- the cap is so poorly designed that it leaks at the seal. The flip top was not opened it literally leaks at the seal where the bottle connects to the cap. I can't even begin to tell you about the strong smell of this shampoo. It is overwhelming and so perfumey it's really hard to take. I ignored this poorly designed bottle and the strong perfume smell and went on to try the product as sometimes shampoo smells are milder when you rinse them out of your hair.The first thing I noticed is that the shampoo is a really thick pink cream- not like my see through completely clear Shampoo One or completely clear see through Pantene for Fine hair. This should have been a dead give away that this shampoo is not good for fine hair as my hairdresser said if you can't see through the shampoo- it's NOT for Fine hair. I tried the shampoo and it hardly foams up but lays on your hair coating it really thick. It doesn't rinse out well leaving my hair greasy yet my hair dried frizzy and felt dried out at the scalp. This is without a doubt the strangest shampoo I've ever used- how can a cream leave your hair and scalp dry and frizzy? The smell was not as overwhelming when the shampoo was rinsed out- but still not a pleasant smell. I couldn't wait to wash my hair again with my Pantene and get this strange drying cream out of my hair. If you have Fine hair- I would not recommend this shampoo- it was one of the worst shampoos I've ever tried. Super Drying Strong Smell Poor Cap Design,Neutral
I have straight fine hair so I am always looking for ways to make my hair look more full. I can usually tell after a week of use if a volumizig shampoo really works or not; thankfully this works better than the Pantene for Fine Hair that I tried.The lather is rich which feels great when shampooing and I get about as much lift as I do with blow-drying my hair upside down. I was pleasantly surprised at how the lift lasts most of the day.The only thing I didn't like was the scent - too perfume-y for me but my husband & son told me they thnk it smells nice like flowers. :) Great For Fine Hair,Neutral
This review is for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo & Conditioner written after using these products for seven days.I should start by saying that I consider this an inexpensive product. The shampoo and conditioners I am used to cost  to  as much as these. Because of this I didn't expect any improvement in the condition of my already very healthy hair after using these products. While I wouldn't consider the condition of my hair improved after seven days of using these products I was pleased that the condition of my hair was pretty much maintained. Despite my hair feeling okay after using these products I won't be giving up my usual products. I like to mix it up with my shampoo & conditioner so I will continue to use these occasionally but not every day. One of the main things I'm not crazy about with these products is the fragrance. It's not that they don't smell good; they smell okay. Not my favorite scent but it's fine. The issue is more that I don't feel like the scent stays with my hair. I don't wear perfume and rarely use any kind of body fragrance so it's important to me that my shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair smelling nice. I don't get that with this product. After Seven Days...,Neutral
This shampoo does not produce a lot of lather but it serves its purpose well. Seems to be kind to existing hair and leaves hair feeling fresh and manageable. As to the claimed properties of nourishing capabilities that is something that I suppose should take continuos use to determine if it helps in any significant way. This shampoo is used daily and so far everyone that tries it agrees it is up there with the competition. The container is easy to open and close and did not detect a strong perfume that could change the whole game for if your hair is going to smell a certain way it better come with some great properties. I remember using a coconut shampoo that left you smelling like a walking pi&#;a colada and that got old really fast for besides the pungent smell of pure coconut it did not add or substract from lesser smelling shampoos.CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo . Fluid Ounce does not intrude with its own particular scent and it seems to be doing a good job of keeping its users with clean and lively hair. I did appreciate the chance of using it and the jury is still out as to wether it will become the daily shampoo from now on. To earn that loyalty it would have to please greatly by the time the last drop is used.I prefer this one to the ones you usually find at drugstores like suave and other cheap offers. In the end what one puts on their hair will be the deciding factor how long and how strong that hair remains part of the scalp specially among men. I have seen some flashy characters that boasted the greatest haircuts until little by little those hair particles became a thing of the past. Short of entering the world of hair transplants which anyone would be very surprised how many people have had a patch or two installed to cover some scary open fields the right shampoo the same as the right soap deodorant etc is an important decision to make. Must not take lightly the fact that one enjoys a heavy flock of hair for even those that always had thick hair and thought that the blessing of plentiful hair had been bestowed upon them woke up one day to find entry ways devoid of hair.This product appears safe as a daily shampoo and all I can hope for is that whatever remains upstairs will keep being so for a little longer at least. I thank amazon like always for the chance to try the shampoo in the first place and for basically being the finest store in the internet for a long long time. . Stars. . Stars,long time
After about  uses I find this to be a decent shampoo but nothing great. It gets my hair clean and rinses out easily but I have not noticed any scalp benefits in  weeks of use- and that's what led me to try this shampoo.I found it to be a bit too perfume-y though others may enjoy the scent.I hope that if you order it Amazon does a beter job of packaging it. This has the sort of lid that you press on one side to flip it up and it must have flipped open a bunch of times rattling around in the box- a lot of product had seeped out and the whole bottle was a sticky mess when I got it. I did not factor this into the review- this is an Amazon issue- but beware! NOTHING SPECIAL,Neutral
Having just evaluated all of the CLEAR male hair products it was time for the women in my house to evaluate the female hair products.  Both the male dandruff shampoo and the female strong lengths nourishing shampoo are advertised to feature Nutrium  some sort of vitamin nutrient compound that is supposed to make hair healthier and strong.I can't really speak much to if it makes hair stronger but the shampoo certainly feels good going on and being lathered.  The shampoo itself appears about the same consistency of the male shampoo a thin runny cream but this one is pink.  The smell is quite nice without smelling like cheap perfume and the smells tends to linger without being overpowering.The bottle itself is easy to use - snap down one end and the other end pops up to dispense shampoo.  Amazon had some issues shipping the free Vine samples - mine had leaked.  Hopefully they are more careful when shipping orders.After a few weeks of this shampoo I'd say hair is clean and smells good and the members of my family rate it highly.  I wouldn't say anybody noticed any huge improvements due to the Nutrium- but it's an effective shampoo that does a good job cleaning hair while smelling nice. Seems to do a good job and smells nice without being perfumy,Neutral
This shampoo cleans well and leaves your hair soft but I can't discern any difference between this and most other shampoos on the market.  It has a light pleasant scent -- not too perfumey -- and it lathers well.  I would use it again but it's nothing to get super-excited about.  Regarding the claim about getting your hair stronger in seven days I honestly can't say I noticed that. Good But Nothing Special,Neutral
It's not marketed as including conditioners but my hair feels like it does after using a conditioner.  So if you have fine thin hair you may not want to use this as conditioners will weigh your hair down.I like it.  A little bit gives a lot of lather.  The scent is clean and pleasant not perfumey.  It's too early to tell if it will really strengthen my hair.  I'm doubtful because I'm older () and my hair has been thinning for years.I don't see that my results are much different from my regular shampoo (Pantene) but I'll probably switch.  It does make more lather than Pantene so I'll be able to use less and I like the light conditioning.  The ingredients list several natural oils so maybe that's where the conditioning comes from.Five stars because it lathers nicely rinses clean and smells good.  There's not much more to ask from a shampoo. I think there's a conditioner in this shampoo,little bit
The scent of this shampoo is an overwhelmingly strong perfume! The shampoo seemed to be cleaning well but my hair looked greasy afterwards. I was not extremely impressed.And a comment about the packaging (although Amazon might package better for non-Vine orders): Mine came wrapped in a bag inside a bubble mailer. Approximately half of the shampoo leaked out. Strong scent hair did not feel clean bad packaging,Neutral
I have never been one to seek out specific shampoo brands.  I purchased whatever brand was on sale.  As long as it lathered up and did its job I was happy.  The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty shampoo proves there is a difference.First of all the shampoo is far richer than other brands I've used.  It comes out of the easy-to-use dispenser in thick ribbons.  When it's massaged into the hair it creates a luxurious feel -- an experience far removed from the routine shampooing I had always done.  In fact I was inspired to do more scalp massaging than ever as I lingered in the shower.It has a faint scent not an overly perfumed one and I liked that.  I can't really confirm the fact that it has strengthened my hair as I've never had a problem with breakage.My wife used it and was pleased with how smooth her hair felt after the shampoo was rinsed out.  She has used several kinds of better shampoos over the years and she reported that the Clear Scalp & Beauty shampoo compares favorably.  Neither of us used the shampoo in conjunction with its companion conditioner which further leads me to believe we saw no appreciable difference in our hair being strengthened.The big question:  Would I seek this product over others in the future?  Perhaps.  I do like its rich texture so that might lure me back.  However a premium price might easily point me back to more economical products.Conclusion:  This is a good product that lathers better than many shampoos leaving the hair smooth and easy to manage. Smooth rich and silky but worth the price?,Neutral
I have very long thick hair and have been coloring it for years so no matter how often I get my hair trimmed most of it is dry and fairly fragile. Although the aroma of this product is a little lighter than the others products of this line that I have tried it is still a little over-powering for my taste.  My hair scent clashes with my perfume.  I hate that and that is why I try always to purchase fragrance free products.But that issue aside- this product seems to do what it claims to do.I'm always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product. Well I'm sorry there just aren't any but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.I did seem to see less hair in my comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower my scalp seems to bee less dry  and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.After drying and using the heated flate iron on my hair it appeared silky somewhat shiny and was quite  easy to manage. The Price is Right,Neutral
I used CLEAR Moisturizing Conditioner in junction with CLEAR Moisturizing Shampoo. The results were better than expected. Here is my experience:Having long wavy hair I first experimented with CLEAR Strong Lengths Conditioner (paired with the moisturizing shampoo). After a week of use my hair was surprisingly weighty. It appears that the product had been causing unwanted build-up. So I used a different brand of shampoo/conditioner for a few days and then switched to this conditioner (with the same moisturizing shampoo). The results were greatly improved. My hair was bouncier and still shiny. So the lesson here is that you might need to find the perfect combination of CLEAR products for your hair.Other notes:I really like the upside-down design of the bottle (it helps prevent that awkward vigorously shaking the bottle in the dangerously slippery shower moment). Likewise I enjoy the pleasant scent (but those who are sensitive to perfumes may this product overwhelming). However if you have long hair like me and are considering the Strong Lengths conditioner you should know that this Moisturizing one is best for non-processed/non color-treated hair. (If you have longer processed hair then Strong Lengths is probably a good bet. It is thicker and coats damaged hair). An Inexpensive Little Gem ...,Neutral
I used this conditioner after I washed my hair with the shampoo that is supposed to be it's partner (Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Moisturizing Dry Scalp).  It was nice and viscous and I used a dollop about the size of quarter.  I worked through my wet hair and left it on for about two minutes.  It rinses out easily and my medium long hair was easy to comb out.  I blew it dry and the texture of my hair was soft and smooth.The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that it is kind of strong on the scent.  Even several hours later I can still smell it in my hair and I'm not partial to anything with perfume.  But if you like a scent that lasts a long time then this would be good to use. A Little Scenty,long time
The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff similar to other brands but cost a bit more in my experience.

I keep my hair very short and this conditioner was so light that if anything it made my hair a bit too fluffy. A very smooth soft nice-to-run-my-fingers-through sort of fluffy but still fluffier than i'm used to.Using this with the matching shampoo i did experience a reduction in dry scalp symptoms so it seems to deliver on the 'dry scalp nourishing' promise.My two problems with this conditioner are both pretty trivial.) The conditioner comes in smaller bottles than the shampoo. No woman i've ever known goes through conditioner more slowly than shampoo so having the conditioner come in a smaller bottle is a little strange.) The smell. It's generic perfume-y and awfully sweet. But it doesn't last after my hair dries so it only troubles me in the shower. If anything a little too lightweight,Neutral
I was unable to continue to use this conditioner due to the extremely strong perfumey scent. And in addition I didn't really feel like it condutioned that well. My hair felt very dry afterwards. Sorry to say--this product ended up being thrown away. strong scent!,Neutral

Well I'm sorry there just aren't any but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.My biggest issue with this conditioner is the smell ---I don't know who think that the aroma of musk (at least this is what I  think this is) is going to be a good one for hair.  I hate wearing anything with a smell other than my perfume.  I usually use fragrance free everything. The aroma of this product clung to my hair for the whole day.I did  seem to see less hair in my  comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.But even after thorough rinsing my hair felt greasier than it did silky. When dry my hair did not have the usual manageability that I normally do with my OTC 'Nexus' products.   Stars with Resevartions,Neutral
I needed a lightweight conditioner to help my color treated hair because it is oily and a bit damaged and this fit the bill.  It really smells nice without having an overly perfumed smell.  But best of all it left my hair feeling silky and easy to comb.  Once dried my hair was not weighted down and felt so soft.  I will be using this conditioner in the future and am giving up my way expensive Lanza product because I like this better.  I knocked off a star because I thought the design of the bottle was a bit odd. Super silky hair,Neutral
I started with just the shampoo first and instantly regretted it. The shampoo requires the conditioner for good results.  The conditioner is very thick and feels oily but doesn't leave your hair oily. It definitely makes it very sleek soft and silky to the touch. It also takes the frizz out of your hair (if you have trouble with that like I do) but doesn't make it limp like some shampoo/conditioner's do. The smell of both the shampoo and conditioner is light and pleasing. It's not fruity or floral. I'd describe it as a very light perfumed scent.I don't know that I will switch to this shampoo and conditioner exclusively when I run out but the price and free shipping (with Amazon Prime) certainly makes it appealing. I awarded it three stars because it requires both the shampoo and conditioner to get great results. I like more freedom in selecting my hair care products. For Best Results Use Clear Shampoo As Well,Neutral
This review is going to be the same for the corresponding shampoo as I received both at the same time to try out. Since I can't (more won't) use each individually to see their own merits because it'll play havoc with my hair the review is going to be for the both of them.OK. First things first. This produces a lot of lather which I discovered when I had to clean off the shampoo bottle that had leaked during travel. This is nice since I like lather but I want to note that hair cleansing products do not need to produce bubbles in order to work. (Very few need to produce bubbles and bubbles/lather is actually from additional bits that have been added to make it look like it's working. Old trivia factoid.) If you're one of the people who dislike having a lot of lather be prepared for this. (I know that there are people out there like this.)The shampoo and conditioner smell pretty nice which is a bonus. I've smelled some shampoos that either don't have much of a scent or they're so overwhelming that no amount of other bonuses can make up for the perfume stench. Clear's scent is neither under or overwhelming. You can smell it if you stick your nose into the washed hair or right after you've used it but it's not going to be smelled across the room.What I really liked was that this didn't weight my hair down overly much. My hair feels nice and soft without feeling heavy or greasy. I'm pretty finicky about shampoo/conditioner products since many will either undercondition (making me look like a brown haired Little Orphan Annie) or they'll undercondition and I'll end up with hair that looks lank and greasy. (I've been pretty happy with my Garnier Nutrisse products for the most part although lately it feels like they've changed the formula slightly.) What I also liked is that after using the combo a few times I don't get a weird buildup feeling to my hair.I rather like this overall. I'm still not sure if I'd overall replace my normal shampoo and conditioner but I'm willing to give this a longer trial period. I've already purchased more of this product with my own money so I suppose that this is as good of a recommendation as any. Rather like it,Neutral
As a summer conditioner this did a great job. It works in and rinses out easily and leaves hair soft and clean but also seems to minimize frizz a bit without feeling heavy.I don't use fancy/expensive shampoo & conditioner so my bar is fairly low but this is better than the super cheap stuff (suave vo) and works well.However I found scent too heavy and perfumy to be pleasant while using it. I prefer light citrus light soap-type or other natural scents to heavy perfumes. I found the scent cloying & more on par with cheap conditioner. At the store I open and sniff everything since the scent is the most challenging aspect of the economy hair products. Based on scent I wouldn't have bought this in a store. However it does disappate quickly so it's only overrpowering while you use it not after your hair is rinsed and dry.Without the heavy scent i'd have given it  stars for the quality for the price. Clean & light conditioner but heavily perfumed,Neutral
This conditioner has very little scent which I like a lot.  I can't stand smelling perfume after a minute or so.  I couldn't even hardly detect any perfume in this conditioner.  I applied to my hair after shampooing and worked it thoroughly in my hair.  I rinsed it out a couple of minutes later. I was very pleased that it was super easy to comb out the tangles and after blow-drying my hair had a nice sheen to it and felt very soft.  I think this product is a very good conditioner. Very Good Conditioner,Neutral
The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is about what you'd expect...it's conditioner and it leaves your hair more soft and manageable than shampoo would on its own. It's a good product and does the job as well as other more expensive brands (and a handful of less expensive ones). It's a thick rich-looking conditioner and if I have one complaint it's that the scent can be a bit overpowering when it's on your hair. It's not a bad scent but it is a very perfumey cosmetic scent. Fortunately what's left behind after rinsing is just a hint of it so that won't be a problem for most. My hair does seem to be better off for using it and that's the most important thing (especially some of its renewed strength).As far as the packaging this gets the same complaint as every other product in the Clear line and that's the cap being on the bottom of the container. It's not a deal-breaker and is largely a non-issue but I've received other products in the Clear line with the same bottle design that opened in transit dumping a good bit of the product into the packaging. Amazon knows this and takes some precautions (taping the cap on and wrapping the bottles in plastic bags) but it doesn't make this the most shipment-friendly product in the world.Over all the Clear Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is a good product at a decent price. As long as you don't mind the fragrance and it doesn't open during shipping you'll be satisfied with it. Leaves hair soft and manageable...just like anything else.,Neutral
I really liked this conditioner. It left my hair feeling very soft and the slip was great! I thought it was a little too perfumey straight out of the bottle but it really made my hair smell great! As for the scalp nourishing benefits it's still a little too early to tell but I'll definitely continue using this product. Very Nice,Neutral
I've been very happy with the Clear line of products. They've performed as well as pricier brands and work well for my hair.This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and touchable even when it's been exposed to being out in the cold which can be very drying. I have long very straight very fine hair and need conditioning without weight or buildup. This works!While other people have said A little goes a long way- that's somewhat true. I do use less of it than other conditioners but still go through conditioner faster than shampoo. The light pleasant scent doesn't rinse completely out but also doesn't clash with any of the perfumes I wear. Nice conditioning,long way
The conditioner ingredients are unremarkable - chemicals plus oils from almonds coconuts soybeans and sunflower seeds. Many conditioners have a similar smell - not a heavy perfume - just that of a typical hair product.Many conditioners now have bottles with lids at the bottom. This is no exception the bottle is elegant and simple - not fat - so it only contains . fl. oz. ( ml) yet is the same height as a . fl. oz. ( ml) bottle - clever packaging to make you think you've bought more than you really have. What differentiates this conditioner is its consistency. It is neither too thick to pour nor too runny to drip. It has just the right creamy consistency that makes it easy to rub into the hair.I have thick dry over-treated hair that can be quite brittle. The conditioner performed as well as the conditioners that typically come with hair color. I have used a paraben free SimplyU conditioner from Walmart that I like better.I compared this conditioner withDove Daily Moisture Therapy Conditioner Dry/Rough Hair  Ounce (Pack of )andGarnier Fructis Conditioner Fortifying Pure Clean Normal Hair  oz..  Both of these were thicker and in both cases I had to put water in the bottle to dilute them - so they probably will last for more shampoos per fluid ounce (or milliliter) than the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Conditioner which I have not had to dilute.I don't wash my hair every day - so the idea of a Nourishing Daily Conditioner doesn't appeal - however I do use conditioner once or twice a week. It has left my hair manageable just as any other good conditioner would.This conditioner is not one I would rave about but it does have excellent creamy consistency that makes it easy to apply.  I like paraben free very simple products. This has about  ingredients - are they really all necessary? Creamy conditioner that flows well out of the bottle,Neutral
My hair is fine but I have a lot of it which gives it the illusion of being thick.  The problem is that when my hair gets a little long the weight of the top layers of hair weigh down the lower ones making my hair look heavy and well blah.  I gravitate toward root-boosting products to restore natural body by giving my fine hairs a little lift.  After using this conditioner my hair retains its body throughout the day.  Even better I love the scent -- I can smell it as I write this and it's been hours since I got out of the shower.  Obviously if you are bothered by perfumes you should look elsewhere.I'm really pleased with this shampoo.  It's going to be in my shopping cart when the current bottle starts to run out.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann I love it!,Neutral
Beautiful hair starts with healthy hair. Although I've been very happy with Pantene for some time I was very interested when I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner. I expected something light and effective without much of an aroma.The conditioner works well enough but is not any better than my Pantene products. Worse it has a heavy perfume smell that I don't like at all.This conditioner definitely leaves the hair soft and tangle free but my hair has no more volume than when I use Pantene.I will finish this bottle but will go back to Pantene when I am done. I like its clean fresh scent much better than this one. 'Clear' conditioner has heavy perfume smell but conditions OK,Neutral
Of all of the Clear conditioners I've tried the Volumizing Root Boost is probably the one I've liked the best. Like a lot of guys my age my hair has started to thin a bit in the front so anything that will make that less noticeable gets my vote. I've tried more than a few products and most don't do much of anything. Fortunately the Root Boost not only conditions well leaving my hair soft and manageable but it also seems to actually volumize the roots and hair shaft making my thin areas look a good bit better (especially on the days that I use Nizoral).The only real negative in my book is the scent. It doesn't smell bad but it's a bit more perfumed than I'd like. The good thing is that Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing conditioner rinses out very well (no oily film in my case) so the scent ends up being much more subtle (and pleasant) than it would seem at first.Clear Volumizing Root Boost conditioner delivers what it promises and really does a great job on my hair. It's definitely going to be a regular purchase from now on. Pretty good...conditions well & seems to make thinner hair more full.,Neutral
I have fine hair and this conditioner works well. There is a  perfumed scent that lingers even after you rinse out the conditioner unlike other conditioners I have used that don't leave much of a smell.  The scent is pleasant enough however.  My scalp feels less dry and looks more vibrant and my hair has excellent body after using this conditioner. The only problem I see with this conditioner is that the opening is on the bottom so if you don't fully close the bottle gravity could take its' toll and some conditioner could leak out (they should have put the plastic opening on the top of the bottle). Otherwise this is a great conditioner. Nice conditioner,Neutral
I was worried about the oils it contains because I thought it would weigh down my chin length hair and also because my home is on a septic tank system and I know grease is the worst thing for the drain field.  But in fact I love how my hair feels after using this conditioner and since I am not detecting any sort of oily residue in my tub I am assuming there is not enough to wreak havoc with my drain field.  The bottle is very easy to handle because the lid and spout are on the bottom and opening it is a simple matter of pressing on one side so the opposite side pops up.  Super easy to open and close.  I withhold one star because the product is heavily perfumed.  Fortunately for me I do not find the scent objectionable but I would rather it had no scent at all. Very nice,Neutral
While you can spend a lot of money on conditioner if you want to you can also get well-formulated conditioners for a reasonable price. This is definitely a well-formulated conditioner that would be well suited for normal to moderately dry hair. This conditions well and rinses cleanly from hair without leaving heaviness or build up behind. It conditions with almond oil and shea butter. This is also only lightly scented (unlike some brands which contain heavy chemically perfumes). This is definitely a good conditioner option at a very reasonable price. good basic conditioner for long hair,Neutral

I really like the smell of this line of shampoos and conditioners. They leave my hair smelling so fresh and clean and not overly perfumey. I thought this version left my hair heavy and weighted down.

My wife used this shampoo and provided me good feedback on the quality of the conditioner it was used right after using a clear shampoo.The only thing which she did not like is the smell/perfume of the shampoo which she felt could have been better.Will update later based on the long term use of this shampoo. Good shampoo except for the perfume/smell,Neutral
This clear and clean smelling hair beauty cream surprised me. One thing was tht it as a classy color.. the packaging that matches almost any bathroom without sticking out like a neon sign. The other was there was no loud perfume smell or ugly coloring. It does what it says... nourishes your scalp which helps during drying weather without making your hair a greasy mess. Yes yes and yes I will continue to use this product. I like it.,Neutral
This stuff is great for facial moisturizing!  I have Caucasian hair and my creme rinses do enough to keep my hair and scalp moisturized besides no directions came with it to tell me how to use it on my hair.  But the skin on my face no longer produces it's own oils and I am always trying to find a lotion product that goes on smoothly and lasts for a few hours before I have to re-apply it.  This product can be used for that since it has all the ingredients in most facial moisturizers anyway and you get a LOT of it!  It should last me for about a year if I don't gob it on too thick.  I like to try to always find more than one purpose for an item and this is how I plan on using this product.  It also makes my lips shiny and relieves chapped dryness.Also I am very sensitive to perfumes and get sick after smelling them for too long.  So far although this product is lightly scented and I've smeared it on my face I yet don't feel icky.  Time will tell though....after a couple more hours if I get urpy I'll update this review. Don't Know About It's Use on Scalp/Hair But.......,Neutral
I ordered this because my hair has been puffy dry and out of control lately. I was looking for something to tame it and bring it back to health. I have used scalp treatments in the past with good success and thought this might get the same type of results.The packaging doesn't list the ingredients on the outside of the label but the face of the product says Shea butter. I don't know why I presumed that meant that this is a natural product because it's not. The first two ingredients are petroleum and mineral oil. Shea butter is number  out of  ingredients. If you are looking for other unnatural and potentially unsafe ingredients it also contains perfume. The rest of the ingredients are natural oils (coconut sunflower palm etc).There are no instructions for how to use this. In the past when I've done a scalp treatment I've used a generous amount on warm wet hair massaged into the scalp coated to the ends of the hair left on for about  minutes and rinsed out. Not sure if this is how it's intended to be used but I'd guess not. I think this was WAY too much product and left on much too long. You can't get it out. It's greasy and clings forever. After five washings it still looks the same. I haven't worn braids in years but that is how you see me today because otherwise you'd see me looking crazy with greasy stringy heavy looking hair.The product doesn't say but I think this is made for African-American hair which I do not have. That would have been good to know in advance. The only other time I used a product made for African-American hair I had the same results. Oh wait a minute! Maybe it does indirectly say that it's for African- American hair. The label says for relaxed and natural hair. My hair is natural and relaxed but God made it that way. I didn't think about those terms not applying to me.So my hair is really shiny/greasy- not a good thing in the heat where I am sweating because all the dirt is sticking to it. That's not really what I had in mind. Needless to say I have big regrets about giving this a go. Problems...,Neutral
First of all I find that the perfume on this balm to be a bit too much.  So much that it becomes noticeable to someone near you.  Some people may like the perfume on it but I did not like it.Next - it leaves the hair sticky feeling. sticky and smelly !,Neutral
I gotta say that I am truly pleased with this cream rinse.  The first thing I noticed after opening was that it wasn't laden with perfume.  I couldn't detect any perfume whatsoever.  I can just barely tolerate perfumes and never wear any so not having my hair smell like a perfume factory for the rest of the day was a very nice surprise.  And on top of that it really moisturized my hair wonderfully!  I used a medium/small blob and worked it thoroughly through my hair after shampooing.  It rinsed out well and left a soft protective coating that really made my hair shine and feel very healthy and soft.  I have shoulder length straight hair and combing out the wet tangles was super easy!  I will definitely be adding this to my list when I need to top off my $ purchase to get Free Super Saver Shipping!  I can't have too much of this if it works this well. No Scent and Works Great!,Neutral
I like the companion shampoo to this product. It does the job with a minimal fragrance that doesn't linger. I expected the same of this product. Boy was I surprised! This has a VERY strong perfume-y smell that I just can't get past...COMPLETELY different than the shampoo. As with the shampoo it does it's job just fine: detangling and conditioning and my hair does feel quite silky (as much a very short bob can) after it's dry. That part I like. It rinses well so hair doesn't feel gummy or sticky. The product appears to have a silicone derrivative in in so if you're trying to avoid that (ie: fine hair or volume style this product may not be for you. If you are fragrance sensitive or just don't like to be your olfactory nerve to be overpowered stay away! Overpowering fragrance...,Neutral
I wash my long hair every night and have to use a conditioner without fail!  I got this Clear Scalp with the matching shampoo and am quite happy with it.  My hair ends up totally soft and totally tangle free.  That's all I ask from a conditioner.  Oh it also can't have a heavy perfume smell because that gives me headaches.  This one has a slight perfume scent and it doesn't linger so that works. No Tangles . . . .,Neutral
I have highlighted hair fairly short and also dry.  This Ultra Shea shampoo works wonders on it.One thing I especially like because I tried theCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo . Fluid Ounce is that the Ultra Shea shampoo has a very mild almost vanilly scent to it.  The moisturizing shampoo I tried previously had a perfumey very strong odor.  Not good when you are sensitive to scents.The shampoo is thick lathers easily and abundantly cleans my hair without drying it - what more could I want?  My hair has more body and is easier to control too.  I will continue to use this shampoo.I like the container too.  Just the right fit for my hand self-closing narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of room. Nice mild scent-also great for my hair,Neutral
This product provided a good clean feeling without a lot of residual perfume odor let over. It rinsed out well and after about a weeks use did not appear to leave any build-up. Nice product.,Neutral
This is a very nice shampoo that appears to work at cleaning hair without any irritation or adverse reactions.  My only complaint is that there is no verbage anywhere on the bottle to advise whether or not this product would be suitable for color-treated hair.  And while I understand that the ingredients are nutritional and balanced for most hair types I still would have been more comfortable knowing that my color would not be compromised.  So I had my husband use it for  weeks.  He was extremely happy with the results and appreciated that there was no heavy perfumed scent to deal with.Update:  August  I decided to investigate and found my local Wal-Mart sells the Clear Shampoo color treated/damaged hair version (lavender colored bottle).  I have been using it for about  days and am very very happy with the results.  In fact it is so rich and creamy that I haven't had a need to use a conditioner afterwords.  I just put on a little Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum and I am good to go. It is much better than I'd originally reviewed,Neutral
OK so I had no illusions that this product was somehow organic & chemical free considering that it's made by Unilever (owner of Alberto Culver Helene Curtis Faberge' etc.) and costs less than  bucks. That being said I had great results with this product. I used it as a hot oil treatment and also to tame flyaways after shampooing (a few drops will do for this purpose).There are NO instructions about how to use the product however. Having worked in the beauty field I didn't have an issue with this. It's a light oil (yes it's mineral oil....that's what less expensive hair products like this are made of) but there are also some fairly nutritious oils added in too. My wavy 'post hypothyroid' hair likes this product even though I believe it's more intended for ethnic hair. If you have a dry itchy scalp or dry frizzy flyaway hair this product can help as long as it's used properly. Think of it like the old fashioned VO (brilliantine) in a bottle rather than trying to use it like a conditioner. I also use an Argan oil hair product and this product is very similar yet at /th the cost.The scent is just right a lightly fruity fragrance which I prefer over flowery perfume-y scents most common in hair care products. If you can keep your expectations in alignment with reality this product is...after all less than $ per bottle...I feel that you'll be satisfied. If not you will be disappointed. If you need a totally organic product that does something similar I'd opt for pure coconut oil instead (with essential oil added for fragrance if need be). Mineral oil can cause acne in individuals prone to it so I'd keep this oil off your face (especially around the hairline where blemishes can develop) if that is the case. You can also wash your face after applying if you happen to spill.If your hair is parched (oil dry) brittle dull (no shine) or heat damaged this product is for you. Otherwise I can see this oil as being too heavy for more normal hair types. Perfect product for frizzy hair....,argan oil
I have dry colored hair I use quite a few different products for softening and shine and thought this might be a nice and very inexpensive option compared to my x the price typical products. I was wrong.The description states: Formulated with Nutrium  Moisture Lock system a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils including vitamin E sunflower coconut almond soybean argan and palm the treatment provides light non-greasy nourishment to the scalp and hair. Notice the lack of mentioning the main ingredient mineral oil? I have very sensitive skin and using anything with mineral oil causes me major breakouts no way would I use something like that on my hair and scalp (since it would inevitably get on my face). I did want to be fair and test it though so I used a tiny tiny amount on the ends of my hair... it left my hair extremely greasy looking and feeling even with just a little drop.I'm considering using it as a hand and/or foot moisturizer and seeing how it works for that and once the bottle is empty I'll soak it and scrub it and then use it for my usual hair syrums since the bottle really is cute and I love how easy it is to dispense just the right amount of product. For the couple dollars it might be a good by for a skin moisturizer and the container ;) Well... it smells ok? Perfumed mineral oil in a cute bottle.,sensitive skin
I had the chance to try this out (I'm a guy) and my impressions are on par with what others have said. This product for me anyways leaves my hair feeling greasy and I don't like perfume smells and this one has a very strong scent. I've given this to my wife to try as well if she is interested if not this will be trashed.It would have been great if there were some real directions on the package but the only steps were massage into hair. Maybe I did it wrong I don't know but I don't like this at all and will not be using it for myself. Greasy and over powering smell,Neutral
The first ingredient is mineral oil but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The mineral oil used in cosmetics is regulated by the USFDA and is highly refined and purified.  It's an ingredient that has been used in cosmetics for over  years.  I don't know exactly how much mineral oil is in this product in relation to the other oil ingredients (coconut palm wheat germ almond sunflower soybean and spinosa kernel) but I imagine it might be as high as %.  Shea butter is around the th ingredient listed if I counted correctly. Any quality oil will help moisturize your hair or skin whether it's mineral oil or pure Shea butter.  They basically perform the same function which to serve as a barrier between your skin or hair to prevent water from naturally leaving thus drying out.What I can't figure out is how best to use this oil.  Since it came with no directions I tried rubbing a small amount into my palms then into my hair especially the ends after shampooing and before blow-drying but the result was that my hair was oily and stiff. I had to rewash my hair to get the oil out of it.  I think maybe applying it before bed to dry hair and let it moisturize over night???The shape of this bottle is just right to hold in one hand while squeezing out a few drops of oil into the other.  I have rubbed it on dry areas of my skin with good results so if I can't use it in my hair it will still smooth out some rough spots on my skin. I am usually very particular about scents and can't wear any perfumes but I rather like the scent of this product. I Like the Scent,Neutral
I am a mixed woman and have very coarse curly hair with frizz that is out of control without oils. This oil had no instructions so I applied it as my other oil products are applied. This left my hair oily and heavy with a thick perfume-y smell that lingered way too long. This company would do well to include real instructions and kill that fragrance as I can't imagine anyone would want to smell like that. Not what it claims to be.,Neutral
Clear Scalp & Hair Ultra Shea Oil is great!  It really does instantly soothe and nourish the scalp for quick relief from dryness. Can be used on wet or dry hair as often as needed. Provides light non-greasy nourishment to scalp & hair and has a light fragrant scent that will not clash with any other perfumes etc. Formulated with Nutrium  Moisture Lock system a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils including vitamin E sunflower coconut almond soybean argan and palm.  Tip:  this product also works great as a cuticle and fingernail treatment. Works Great!,Neutral
This oil is very light weight and moisturizing and unlike hair grease my hair didn't start itching uncontrollably because of the clogged pores.  The only issue I have with this oil is the smell.  I put it on and then fell asleep; the smell woke me up and kept me distressed.  I ended up going outside to try to let my hair air out but the smell is still there.If you are going to use this oil I suggest you use it in the MORNING right before you go outside so your head has a chance to air out some before you go to bed.What does it smell like?  I don't know if it is papaya or what it is but it some type of sweet fruit.  Think about those fruit smelling perfumes at Bath and Body Works--well this hair oil smells like that.  Specifically Bath and Body Works has a perfume called Sunflower ---this smells like that perfume.Edited to add: I see the ingredient list and I think the smell is from the Sunflower Oil.  The first ingredient in this product is MINERAL OIL.  My body normally reacts negatively to mineral oil.  I will update.Update: Smell went away after about a day; relaxer didn't burn as bad because this oil does not cause itching like other hair oils.  I defintely will use it if I know I am going to be outside and can let the oil air out in my hair before going back inside. Very light weight and moisturizing oil!,Neutral
This product comes wrapped in plastic wrap but no instructions. It has a pleasant scent but it is really just oil and if you want to revitalize your scalp oil can irritate especially if it has a scent or other additives.It took a while to review because this product comes with no directions. Do I wash my hair add it to my scalp and if so how much? How many drops do I use? In absence of instructions I washed my hair as usual (I have semi-dry color-treated hair) and after the shampoo cycle added some to my scalp. Instantly I could feel the moist oily feel this product left on my scalp.So I proceeded added conditioner and dried (I air-dry since my scalp is sensitive).Almost immediately I noticed a problem. My hands came away oily from my scalp Not good and NOT attractive.  Also my scalp felt irritated by the oils and perfume. Not good. I went home and rinsed my hair out completely but unfortunately the greasy oil remained and I could feel the prickling of scalp irritation. Whatever ingredients are in this product my scalp did not feel revitalized or moisturized and my hair looks greasy like I haven't washed it in days.I'm disappointed. Perhaps better instructions and a product guide would be useful. I can't say however that my scalp is anything but irritated and not attractive after using this. Bad Hair for days plus irritated scalp,Neutral
The oil is pretty thick and scented a bit strong.  Keeps the hair firm and in place - lets you work your hair the way you want it.  It is particularly suitable for people of Asian and African descent who have thicker hair.The bottle itself looks cheap but dispenses oil pretty well.Be warned that the oil smell is feminine - guys please do not use this.  Tried it on a Friday evening and realized that I need to shampoo before I meet anyone else ! Thick oil but a little strong on the perfume,Neutral
I love this stuff. It's gentle on my hands and smells amazing: as in I am trying to find a perfume that smells similar. It's the only soap I use. Warm ginger and sweet coconut is a match made in heaven. Best smelling soap,Neutral
This plate is really cool because of all the logos on it and so far I have really liked these plates from this seller it was hard to decide what to stamp first I like the fact it has an apple on it I am really thinking of painting it multicolor (because I have done this technique on other plates) and stamping it like the old rainbow apple logo from back in the 's/early 's maybe over gray because then it will really look like a computer and there's the bunny (actually the major reason I bought this I collect like everything with that logo from perfumes to jewelery and many other items.) For my first design I ended up doing the C's on my nails across the bottom and on top and I used a different plate with a lace design along with it and its beautiful it looks expensive and elegant and if your good at thinking about the right colors to use it can look like you got designer nails it's something I would wear for a night out I did this because I think it will look nice for New Years Eve and my nails usually stay chip proof for about a week so it will be perfect. I love the logos,Neutral
I've found salicylic acid to be pretty useless for treating my mild inflammatory acne so I was delighted to finally stumble across Oxy Face Wash in the store one day. I bought it solely because it was the only face wash I could find with benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient and it has turned out to be a great product. Though it hasn't completely eliminated my acne it has definitely reduced the frequency and severity of my breakouts.The wash is a thin white liquid with a kind of runny consistency but since it lathers up and is easy to apply I don't consider that a problem. In fact the watery texture makes it much easier to rinse off than other washes I've tried such asClean & Clear Cleanserwhich is more paste-like. I also appreciate that it doesn't really have any odor or perfume.I noticed that some reviewers mentioned it making their faces dry but I've actually found this to be the least drying treatment out of all the BP products I've tried. I put it on in the shower every morning and my face always feels clean and soft after rinsing it off. It's important to keep in mind that this is the maximum benzoyl peroxide dose so if you haven't been using BP on your skin before you may want to start out with a % treatment or just use this every other day to let your skin acclimate and avoid irritation and peeling. Additionally using a non-greasy moisturizer is a critical part of any acne treatment regimen and that will of course also help with dryness if it occurs.As with any BP treatment this stuff WILL bleach everything it touches including towels and clothing. Even when I went to great lengths to avoid using colored towels around my face the residue from my fingers was enough to discolor them. If this is something you care about then you should probably just use white towels. Great BP face wash,great product
I received this in the mail as a complimentary gift and I was hesitant about using it since I always use % natural oils on my hair. I used it as a mask the first day I got it and left it on my hair overnight and took a shower the next day and my hair never felt softer and smoother! I also used it when my hair was dry and it didn't give my hair an oily look to it it absorbs pretty quickly. I was surprised to read about how awful the smell is because I honestly do not know what the problem with the smell is mine has a very sweet smell to it it's not repulsive at all it smells like perfume. I guess if you do not like sweet smells this might not be great for you but if you don't put a lot of product on your hair you won't smell it since it does not linger. It makes the hair feel really soft and it's great if you put it on your dry ends it really gets rid of the dry look. Overall great product!! If you are hesitant about buying it buy the small bottle. Smooth hair,great product
Not a refined oil so not for consumption. I never buy avocado oil for cooking or infact any other oil since nothing tops extra virgin olive oil but further more this is not for cooking either. It is nonsense to use processed avocado or almond for cooking when I do actually consume both in natural state. Almond oil is the moisturiser I use instead of any other lotions or creams which are made out of bunch of chemicals and alcohol. Avocado oil is much heavier in texture than almond oil with different natural ingredients like collagen-supporting amino acids and proteins as well as vitamins A D and E. Sugar cane produces glycolic acid one of the natural alpha hydroxy acids that ex-foliate the skin. I combine these two without any other perfumes scents or anything else like essential oils or what so ever in a bowl and take it with me to the beach. I massage it gently onto my skin leave it on till I feel uncomfortable and then jump in the ocean and surf... The end of the day after a cold shower I apply almond oil and wolla my skin is in heaven happy and healthy. Bravo. Sugar Srub...,Neutral
The scent of argan oil is definitely the strong note. It does work as a texturizer. Style hair first then spray and scrunch to liking. It can't hold flyaways the way a pomade would but it can serve as a slightly gently hair spray. perfumed texurizer,argan oil
I have really sensitive skin and love this product. I also have sinus and allergy problems so even those ones without perfumes often have something in there that you can still smell. This one doesn't and it's great for morning or night under my makeup. I use their night cream in the day time sometimes too. I have dry skin and can't always tell the difference. Great for sensitive skin,dry skin
The soap has a slight sanitary odor and no perfume but compared to similar antibacterial soaps it is dilute (needs  pumps for handwash compared to the customary ) Good non-fragrant soap NOT concentrated,Neutral
I used Wen for  / years and fell in love with it as I was able to FINALLY grow my hair out..and it looks lush and thicker than ever before. I must say that I have always hoped the prices would lower or there would be an alternative soon. I have tried several which I didn't particularly care for enough to make the switch. Until Renpure. It is less than half the price and apples to apples...I would give it a  compared to a  for Wen. The only thing that I notice is that it is a bit less comb-able after cleansing....but not that bad. I am tempted to perhaps combine the two and reduce my costs that way. Nevertheless I find this to be a very good alternative to the much pricier brand name. Nice fresh clean fragrance as well. Not at all perfumed. A very good alternative to the pricier brand!,Neutral
I generally like Neutrogena products - they tend to be gentle effective and not too expensive for what you get. Part of my daily routine is their Rain Bath shower gel and I was interested to compare it to the new Ultra Gentle Daily Cleaner.Overall I like the Ultra Gentle. To be honest although I'm sure it's different chemically it feels a lot like the typical liquid soap going on. The consistency foaming action and so on are about the same as say SoftSoap. Still where the Neutrogena has an edge is that it seems less drying - I'm sensitive to many soaps and with the Neutrogena product you feel a bit less of that soapy dryness after you rinse and dry off.A few reviewers mentioned the scent of this product. While I don't find it at all offensive (though it's not that traditional Neutrogena scent) I'm a bit surprised there's any scent at all...I'd expect something truly Ultra Gentle to have no need for perfumes. I don't consider this a negative just a surprise.About the only gripe I have with this product is that it tends to feel thick and sticky on your skin - sort of the consistency of honey. This means it takes tons of water to rinse thoroughly and I might have preferred a thinner more liquid feel.Definitely a solid product at the price and if you have sensitive skin or just like to pamper yourself Neutrogena UltraGentle is worth a try. Good alternative to other soaps,sensitive skin
For an ultra gentle daily cleanser claiming to be for sensitive skin I would have assumed this product would be fragrance free. However fragrance is listed in the ingredients. The product does seem to be dye-free as I did not see any dyes listed in the ingredients and the product was clear when pumped out. If you have sensitive skin I would recommend Simple over this product. Simple lists on the front of their products no perfumes no dyes. Fragrance Why?,sensitive skin
The general idea when manufacturing a cleanser that is marketed &#;for sensitive skin&#; is to keep out ingredients are common irritants to skin. I had high hopes for this cleanser - just what I have been needing - but nope can't use it. Some dope put perfume in it.It claims to be &#;hypoallergenic&#;. It is not. Perfume is a very common allergen.Worse yet once on the skin it is very difficult to wash off like clingy. I couldn't rinse it off with lots of water and it wouldn't even come off when I scrubbed with a washcloth. It says &#;Rinses clean&#; but it doesn't. So there I was with perfume on my face couldn't get it off wondering whether my face would have one of its bad reactions and get red and swollen and ugly-coarse.I was looking forward to this product but can't recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin unless they know they don't react badly to perfumed cleanser. Aside from the perfume issue my face did feel soft and clean. Beware of perfume; this is NOT hypoallergenic.,sensitive skin
I've purchased this serum  more than once as it really works...easy to apply doesn't interfere with my perfume isn't expensive.  I'm a satisfied customer. Works as well as the advertisement states,Neutral
I purchased this perfume  years ago from macy's and fell in love!  Once i saw that it was running low I immediately went to search for a new one.  The price is great and it came earlier than my expected delivery date so i was ecstatic. The only problem I had was that the product came in damaged.  The box was destroyed on the top and when I opened the box the little balloons on the top of the perfume's cap fell off! On the package it says &#;FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE&#; but I guess this was overlooked. This sadly forced me to give this product  stars. Great product- Poor delivery,great product
This scent is very pretty!  Not overpowering!  Sweet floral/fruity scent that is so nice!  The combination is truly unique!The only problem I've found with this fragrance is that is does not last for long.  The scent is barely noticeable after  hours.  I'm disappointed about that because it indicates that it is not a high quality perfume.Nonetheless I still recommend it due to it's unique smell that I feel any woman of any age can wear! Love the fragrance but it doesn't last long!,Neutral
This perfume has such a wonderful smell. I've never smelt anything like it. I'm  years old and I wanted something hip but not a smell that seemed too young for me. This has an undertone smell that keeps you wanting to smell more of it. I put it on in the store and then walked around. I thought I was standing by some other girls that smelled so good. Then I realized it was me. I immediately went back and bought it. I could still smell it on me the next morning when I woke up. This lasts a long time! VERY much WORTH the money. Gomez was right on with this one...it's about time that there is a reasonable perfume that smells good and lasts. Awesome!!,Neutral
this perfume is absolutely wonderful!!! I haven't liked a scent this much in years--this one is number  with me now!!!!!!! SELENA--love-love,Neutral
In my opinion Selena Gomez came out with a perfect perfume. This is my favorite celebrity fragrance. I haven't smelled nothing else like this. Defiantly worth the $. I've already bought  bottles since it came out in May. It's fruity just right not overpowering like some can be. I can't get enough of this perfume. I hope she releases a sister fragrance next year I'll be waiting. This is definitely a unique perfume. This is a must buy must have if you love perfume. The bottle is cute as well. Best Perfume of ,Neutral
I really like this scent. It's not to sweet and not too mature. Somewhere in the middle. It's hard to describe perfumes online. I'll just say that this one is really nice :) Really Like,Neutral
I absolutely fell in love with this perfume! I know that you think of teenie-bopper when you see Selena Gomez perfume but I myself don't care about the name. I'm in my 's and I love the smell. I would give it  stars except that the smell doesn't last very long Smells great doesn't last long,Neutral
I am so happy with my purchase. The perfume is delicious and so far it last many hours on my body. The bottle is so cute. Gorgeous bottle!,Neutral
What caught my attention at first was the cute bottle when I was trying some fragances at the perfumerie. I asked for it to try it and... I liked it but since I tried some others I couldn't really tell how amaizing it is until later what a delicious fragance!!!! Gets better and better! I have a  ml bottle and I'll make sure I don't run out! Selena Gomez surprise!,Neutral
While I like this product and feel that it does help my skin I would rather have something that is unscented. Unlike some of the reviewers I find the scent to be strong and not pleasant and I'm told it is noticeable. That makes me less willing to use it during the day unless I am staying in. At night it's a waste of the sunscreen as well as noticeable to my bf who would prefer I did not use it. Maybe if it had a citrus scent instead of floral...? I do think it is a good product but only if you (and your significant other) like the scent. Strong perfumey scent - wish it came unscented,Neutral
These towelettes are very moist and have a nice thick quality.  They effective remove skin oil leaving your skin feeling soft.  I read that some people thought the towelettes were too wet I disagree.  There is always some evaporation even within well-sealed packages so the wetter the better for me.  My only complaint and why it is not a  star review--is the scent. I cannot stand strong smelling products.  Women use makeup with a scent soap and shampoo with a scent hairspray with a scent then add perfume.  It is too much. These towelettes are way too strongly scented for me to to continue to use them it chokes me.  But - if they sell an unscented variety I would love to have these around on an on-going basis. Good Product but Can't Take the Scent,Neutral
These are a lovely practical value. Easy to use..no loud smelling perfume stuff (yay!). I try to avoid products that clash loudly with my perfume. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was I had to go find a empty container to store it in after opening it. Would I buy it again? Yes. It was worth getting up for a container for. lol. Good product at a fair price. Lovin My Skin!,Neutral
These wipes are great at cleansing and makeup removal. They are thick and very moist. The texture gives light exfoliation and my skin is left feeling clean but not tight and dry. However...The fragrance is very strong -flowery and perfumey rather than a clean  type scent. The fragrance is also very long -lasting. I can still smell it on my hands and face hours after use.If pond 's made an unscented version of these I 'd use them daily but this fragrance is a big turn off for me. I 'D LOVE THESE IF THEY WERE UNSCENTED,Neutral
I actually had to put some makeup on to test this properly. :)These are big fluffy textured towels quite wet with a cleanser that foams when rubbed. This gives the disturbing impression of rubbing soap all over your face and then... leaving it there. But actually it seems to wipe off pretty clean. The textured bumps are good at scrubbing off makeup (and probably other things that don't show up so easily on the white cloth.)The cloths are very heavily perfumed but the scent doesn't linger so I didn't mind much. They left my skin feeling clean but not dried out. Tolerable even without additional moisturizer. Obviously actually washing and moisturizing is going to be better for your skin on a daily basis but this is much better than nothing. They're ideal for travel or the occasional late party night when you just want to get the make-up off and collapse into bed.Not that I would know anything about that. Just guessing here. ;) Quite flowery but cleans well,Neutral
I had never tried a Pond 's product so I had no idea what to expect. I liked this a lot - it left my skin clean without any feelings of tightness or dryness. I'd give it  stars if the scent was less strong and perfumed. GOOD CLEANSER WITH A STRONG SCENT,Neutral
A little dab will do ya with this great facial cleaner!!! Just put some on your hand about the size of a dime add water and you've got yourself a nice sudsy cleaner that leaves your face feeling smooth and soft!  Another great factor about this product is it isn't perfumey it has a mild clean smell to it!Nice economic & refreshing are the best words to describe this product!! Suds up well!  Makes skin feel very soft!!!,Neutral
I love this product.  I detect no scent and it get's my skin nice and squeaky clean without feeling dry.  My face is soft and smooth after each u se.  Makes putting my powder foundation look a lot nicer.  I will buy this product again and again and again.  I enjoy a facial cleanser that doesn't have a perfumey or gross smell because early in the morning I don't want to smell anything but my coffee.  I like the packaging as well.  The natural way the bottle sits allows the product to be ready and available. I wish more shampoo companies would take note.The texture of this cleanser is smooth. It's called exfoliating and I expected it to perhaps have some type of exfoliating beads or some such thing inside.  I'm glad it doesn't have those but mention it here because I really expected them. very nice and leaves skin soft,Neutral
I'm a big fan of facial exfoliators - I love the way they leave my skin feeling extra clean and fresh looking.  Having said that not all exfoliators are created equal nor is there one product that will work for every complexion; you have to do a little experimenting.I liked this product.  It's a good basic cleanser and gentle exfoliator.  My skin can be sensitive and this did not leave it red or irritated looking.  It has a nice lather and rinses off easily leaving my combination skin feeling soft and lightly moisturized.  I'd recommend using a about a nickel sized amount; you really don't need a lot of product.  I found the scent a little strong and old fashioned - rosewater or something similar.  No scent is left behind once you rinse your face but if you're sensitive to product odors I wouldn't recommend this.Who might like this?  Those with dry or combination skins; I think it's too rich/creamy for those with oily or acne-prone complexions.  Also although it is a good basic cleanser if you wear full make up (foundation powder etc.) you might want to use a make-up remover before this product.Who should probably avoid this?  Definitely anyone sensitive to perfumes.Will it leave your skin luminous?  Just do what I do:  Don't get too close to the mirror invest in flattering bathroom lighting and subtly squint your eyes when staring at your reflection.  Hey after a certain age you have to put a little effort into looking luminous! Good gentle cleanser/exfoliator; scent is a little strong,Neutral
I have oily skin and have tried hundreds of products over the years to keep my skin both clean and unblemished. I also have rosacea so if I scrub too hard or use products with too many chemicals my skin turns read. So it's a delicate balance. I want my pores to be clean. I want my skin to be oil-free. I also want to be gentle with my skin so it doesn't look like a lobster.I had high hopes for Pond's Luminous Clean. Ponds is a fairly well known brand. This product markets itself as a daily exfoliating cleanser not a scrub. So one would think it was gentle. Also it says it has Kaolin clay in it. I'm a fan of clay products to draw gunk out of pores.Unfortunately this just isn't the product for me.First the scent. I want my scrubs to REMOVE everything from my face. I absolutely don't want or need it to be adding fragrance to me. Both for chemical reasons and for scent reasons. If I'm going to use a scent I want to choose it myself after I am clean. I don't want my perfume choice to have to compete with the rose of this cleaning product.Next I didn't get any sense that it was much of an exfoliator. Yes one might call it a bubbly cleanser. But an exfoliator? I don't think so. If someone needs exfoliation this isn't the product to go with.And finally my face felt tingly and chemical-reactant when I was done. Again I've used many products over the years so I know that some products are chemical-laden and others are gentle. The product claims to have gentle microbeads - and maybe the *microbeads* are gentle but the chemicals used are not. I definitely can't use this every day. I've had it for several months now hoping to find the right ratio of when to use it and I just can't bring myself to use it frequently. I have so many other cleansers that work better that to choose this one instead feels like a trial I have to go through in order to properly do this review. And I only do it on days I know I won't be leaving the house.Summary - if you just want a frothy soap that has a strong rose scent and your skin doesn't mind being hit with chemicals this could be just right for you. For me I can't even bring myself to finish off the one container provided to me by Amazon Vine to do my review. I may have to foist the rest on a friend and see what they think. Not Good for My Skin,Neutral
I didn't even use this product.  I opened the shipping envelope and I was inundated with this strong perfume smell and I didn't even open the item because I didn't like the smell.  This product just wasn't for me because I like things with lighter smells that aren't so powerful plus when you put it on your face it smells even stronger because it's right under your nose. Smelly!,Neutral
I use a lot of body wash and was excited to try the Seventh Generation Nourishing Body Wash especially because it contains natural ingredients.  For the most part I like it.  It lathers up well and does a good job of cleaning.  The body wash rinses off well without leaving any residue. For me the lavender smell was underwhelming.  When I first sniffed the body wash while it was in the bottle it really didn't smell like lavender at all.  However once I used it there was just the faintest smell of lavender - I like that because it doesn't get in the way of any perfume I want to wear.Seventh Generation Nourishing Body Wash may not be the nicest smelling body wash I've used but it does a good job. Does a good jo,Neutral
To be fair this is the first body wash I've used in quite some time having switched to soaps a couple of years ago.  But as I do like and trust Seventh Generation I decided to give this a shot with the report that I am about as pleased with this as any other body wash I've tried.The potential consumer must be aware this is simply a body wash.  This will not give you a sparkling glow this will not significantly moisturize your skin.  But it will get you clean and leave you with a clean feeling.  It suds well and a little goes a long way.I used the lavender which is a hit-and-miss scent for me as I'm picky about my lavender.  This particular one works and is light enough in power as to not act as a total perfume (which I hate).  My husband who is super-sensitive to lavender had no problem with it.  Bonus.No it's not one of those ultra-fancy washes but it does its job and it does it with Seventh Generation's usual standards and promises.  I'm quite satisfied. Simply Clean,Neutral
I got this as a Christmas present and just placed an order for more. Amazing smell and even better it works! I apply it wet or dry I find applying it wet that it sinks in better. I cannot rave enough about the smell. There are certain hair products that work great but the smell is chemically or alcohol like. I would rub this on as a perfume if I could. It smooths down every fly away piece of hair that I have.Try it you will not be disappointed. Best hair oil around!,Neutral
I liked the color and having sunscreen in one product.  It had more perfume than I care for so I won't buy it again. ok,Neutral
I have very fine lines under my eyes and my left eye has a little darkening under it so I wanted to see if the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment would work and it took about three weeks before I could see any difference. The difference is very subtle and you have to look very closely but I did notice small changes but nothing dramatic.As an African American Woman it is hard to find a product that can effectively fix small lines because our skin is different and we have to use different products but the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment was perfect on my skin and to me surprisingly effective.I am also very careful of what I use on my eyes because I have allergies and anything overly perfumed or too strong will have my eyes teary and runny all day and this eye treatment didn't cause any issues and I was able to get really close to apply the cream. The metal applicator is nice because it's cool and makes it easy to apply the RevitaLift Power Eye Treatment because you can get a precise application without wasting any of the serum.Great eye treatment but it doesn't work overnight but you will eventually start to notice the difference under your eyes because I sure did. Works on Every Skin Type,Neutral
I love love the applicator on this eye cream. It's easy and smooth and cool when you apply the contents of the tube. It absorbs quickly and the best part is there is no perfume! YAY! I will say that I wasn't as impressed with the other creams I received recently but I did like this one. I did think it helped with the dark bags under my eyes. My lines around my the corner of my eyes look the same. So that was a bummer. I didn't break out and my eyes didn't water.So the positives are:no perfumehelped with the bags under the eyes and the darknessgoes on welldidn't break outNegatives:didn't help the lines around my eyes. They are still there and it doesn't look like they diminished at all. Lovin' my eyes,Neutral
The smell is amazing! I one of those annoying people who can't handle scents especially perfumes. However the wash has a light scent clean scent that doesn't linger. It feels fantastic in my hair is really easy to use & completely stink free :)I'm a caucasian chick with long thick Czech curls I can never tame. For years I've searched for some magic shampoo conditioner or gel to help me form my curls without frizz head. So far no luck but the cowash has given me reason to hope. Granted it's not a magic potion to fix all my issues. I still have issues with detangling my hair but it's easier than with other products. My hair doesn't feel stripped raw but it is clean and feels great. The longer you leave the product on the better is seems to work. So after I washed it out I put a dime size amount in my palm and then run it through my hair as a leave in product. After one use I've noticed less frizz  & better formed curls. Keeping my fingers crossed that I've finally found the product to finally tame the mess on my head. So far so good,Neutral
Update-- I had to quit using this and go back to my regular creams the lines on my face were getting worse with every day. I could see myself aging in the mirror. I am so very disappointed in this cream it actually made me look worse and I can see how much my ROC actually does do for my face. Mileage may vary but my experience is that it doesn't do anything at all for my skin I may as well not use any moisturizer at all the way my face looked.I have been using it for a approximately a week and my face does feel smoother but I haven't seen any reduction in wrinkles and around my eyes I noticed I am having more wrinkles appearing. I will use it another week yet to see if there is any  change. I also just recently developed a couple breakouts I am not sure it is from this or not but if it continues I will quit using this to see if they disappear.It feels really smooth and creamy when applying it the scent isn't overpowering to me and I don't like perfume. It looks and feels like it should work but so far I have not seen any firming or improvement and it does show some improvement in - weeks. not too sure about this just OK so far,Neutral
This cream can be used day or night and it's sufficiently thick to be moisturizing yet it absorbs very quickly. And my skin was left very smooth afterwards. The packaging is gorgeous; a high-end looking glass jar in a rich red color bronzed lid. All shaping up to be a very good choice for a moisturizer. But the cream has a strong perfume not one I like and it lingers for hours. It's irritating in fact and makes my eyes water and get red. I wanted to like this cream and it does do what it says--it smooths and firms your facial skin. But due to the perfume it's a non-starter for me. There is no need for perfume in face cream and it's very sad that the manufacturer feels they have to add a common allergen and irritant to a very good product. Completely sad and perfectly unnecessary. Smooths skin instantly too much fragrance,Neutral
This is an effective moisturizer that also includes anti-aging properties in its formula. I was immediately very impressed by the high-quality container. The bottle is heavy glass and decorative. There's nothing cheap about it.The moisturizer itself is thick and easy to apply. The scent is strong and though it's not my favorite smell (a little too much perfume) it didn't bother me.After applying it my skin felt smooth and fresh. We'll see about whether it repairs redensifies and re-firms but right now I would definitely purchase this product again. Good Quality Moisturizer,Neutral
This product is marketed as an AM/PM moisturizer for aging skin.  According to the directions on the side of the package it should be applied afterL'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatmentfor best results.  It claims to:*Repair Wrinkles*Redensify Skin*Re-Firm SkinI wasn't all that impressed by this one.  While I'm probably the target market for this type of product I have combination skin - mostly normal with a tendency to be oilier in the T-Zone.  This cream felt a bit greasy to me and left my skin feeling sticky.  Even an hour after I've applied it my skin still has a tacky feel to it.  That's not a big deal for nighttime use but I could never use this as a daytime moisturizer; my skin would be far too oily and it would interfere with make-up application.  The biggest drawback however is the strong fragrance.  This product is heavily perfumed and the scent did not appeal to me.  I also get a slight burning sensation when I first apply the cream which disappears completely in about  seconds.  It's very possible that my skin is reacting to the fragrance.As to the product claims....*Hyaluronic Acid can temporarily plump up the skin which can make wrinkles slightly less noticeable but as far as I know it has no permanent or lasting effect.*Redensify?  As in make the skin thicker?  Stronger?  Not sure what they're claiming here.*Re-Firm:  Supposedly this contains an ingredient that has been shown to enhance collagen production.  If you check the teeny-tiny print at the very bottom of the container you'll find that this is based on In-vitro studies.  I'm not quite sure how that translates to collagen production in a living breathing human.Would I recommend this?  If your skin is dry and not sensitive to fragrance then this is probably a decent moisturizer.  I think the anti-aging claims are overblown.  The price may seem budget friendly at first glance but keep in mind that they recommend that you use another product before this one for best results. OK moisturizer for dry skin; Anti-aging claims are dubious.  Strong scent.,dry skin
I like the product but will probably not use it when going anywhere just after using it as it has a too strong fragrance. I like the cream as it has a nice texture and absorbs readily. I have to wonder why then would they add so much smell to the product so much so that it will almost overpower any perfume that I might use. The fragrance does dissipate after awhile so I will probably use it when I am not leaving the house for an hour or two.One issue that I have noted is that it seems to affect my sinuses slightly probably because it is a firming agent. The effect goes away after awhile but something to consider if you have any sinus issues.It does help make the skin feel softer and moisturized so if you can handle the smell it is a very good value for the money in comparison to other moisturizers. Nice moisturizer but too much fragrance.,Neutral
The perfume smell of this product is a bit overwhelming.  I tried it twice and both times I got a headache from the smell.  I'm not usually sensitive to scents so I was surprised.  The moisturizer itself is nice and thick and absorbs well.  However when I applied it around my chin and lip area I experienced a stinging sensation. It was weird.  I won't be using this product again and would warn anyone that is sensitive to smells to look elsewhere. Very strong smell,Neutral
I'm enjoying this face cream. It has a bracing feeling when I put it on and it keeps my skin from feeling dry. I'm not sure that even the month given for review time would be enough to see real results. I've been using it for five days and I have not noticed anything yet. The scent is pleasant enough if perfumey. I assume it increases blood flow to the skin thus the bracing sense. The jar is very pretty to leave on the bathroom shelf. Like many of these products it's a bit pricier than plain moisturizer but much cheaper than high end wrinkle creams so the price is okay. I am not entirely comfortable with not recognizing any of the ingredients -- nothing natural? Really? It would not be my choice for long-term use for that reason. Unless it's phenomenal. I'll update in another few weeks.I should mention that it *could* be causing my skin to break out. I have to look into that. Four stars so far,Neutral
I was so excited to find Naturally Me's Eczema Treatment Body Butter. I can't tell you how long I have been searching online for something that wasn't made from chemicals or dyes. I have been reading for the past year when my breakouts got a lot worse about how adding more chemicals to my body is not a good plan to improve my eczema. And as someone who cares about the environment and animals I love the fact that it is vegan cruelty free and made in the USA.All that said let's talk about the product. First off I always feel good shopping from amazon online. The experience is always good and I got it on the day promised. It came in nice packaging... A simple lightweight plastic jar with a simple black lid. NO fuss!As soon as I opened it the first thing I noticed is that it doesn't have a weird chemical smell. It has a light lavender vanilla smell that doesn't smell like the doctor's office. Although I am not a fan of perfumed creams I was glad to find out that it didn't smell so strong that it would compete with my perfume.I read the directions and they suggested that I use it with Naturally Me's homemade gluten free oatmeal soap. Well I didn't buy that yet but I have a soap I like so I soaped up and then applied the butter. It is rich and thick and goes on smoothly. It is certainly very moisturizing and I didn't have any reactions with the first application like stinging or red bumps which has happened to me before.So far I am really pleased. It has only been a few days but I can tell already that my skin feels softer and moisturized and it seems to have anti-itch properties as promised. I know this isn't  a cure for eczema but so far so good.If this works out and I am very optimistic I will continue to use this product.The one thing is that it's kind of small so I might try a larger size next time so I'll get a little more bang for my buck. Love this. A great find!,Neutral
I had been looking for something that feels lighter and better than foundation but stills gives a good level of coverage and I found it with this.It feels neat when you put it on your skin; it's like it turns into water as you rub it on! It was a little tricky to figure out how to put it on at first. I tried to use a brush then a makeup sponge but hands are definitely the best tools for this stuff (just be sure to wash your hands before AND after if you decide to do this as well). I was actually surprised by the level of coverage this has. I still need to use a little bit of concealer in places where I am very red or have a breakout here or there but not very much.The only con I have is that it does smell a bit perfumey so if that is something that irritates your skin then I suggest you try something else. Overall though I really dig it. :) Feels good,little bit
feels nice going on very strong perfume smell(this whole line does actually) esp for face products...hasn't made a change in the appearance of my face at all. used it for about . months have recently changed to another line that doesn't smell so strong. strong perfume,Neutral
I was skeptical about using this product because in my opinion L'Oreal although their products are awesome they are heavily perfumed. I have super sensitive skin and senses and I can't use things that are really perfumy. I am going to try this because I am getting older and my dermatologist says it is time to start preventive maintenance. At  I do not have wrinkles yet but I do have age spots. The discoloration is from all the time in the sun in my past hopefully this product will help with that. Hmmm,sensitive skin
I've tried so many products that promise to erase all signs of aging. They range from affordable to crazy expensive. I find the results to be about the same either way.So I tried L'Oreal's Revitalift serum with no real expectations.I've been using it as directed for  weeks now and there have been noticeable changes to my skin. I'm  with very few wrinkles several darker age spots and dull skin color.The most success I had was with the age spots. Like I said I've tried several products (all price ranges) and never noticed a difference. With the Revitalift I am seeing noticeable fading.Wrinkles: I don't have many so it's hard to tell with that.Dull skin color: There was a difference but not really what I want. Instead a more natural healthy glow my skin seems shiny. Not oily feeling but it does look greasy at first - it does fade to a natural look after a few hours.One other thing I would point out is the smell. Personally I'm sensitive to perfumes and this has a fairly strong perfume odor. It fades quickly but I'm not sure why my face cream would need to smell like perfume.All in all I think this product delivers on it's claims and for a reasonable price. More so than other products I've tried despite a few drawbacks. Bang for your buck,Neutral
This is my forth bottle from Paris's line and I have to say I absolutely love it! The scent starts off with a fun fruity blend of mostly cherry with my skin chemistry and then mellows out into a beautiful bouquet of flowers. Love love LOVE this perfume! And not to mention the bottle is gorgeous! Defiantly will be buying this one again! By far Paris's best scent!,Neutral
The peach is the strongest fruit note on me and gives the fragrance a soft fuzzy feel. The cherry and apple gives the quieter fruit a bit of bite and energy whilst the powdery vanilla is present through all of the fragrance.The floral notes used in DAZZLE remain watery and in the background. Aside from a breeze of orange blossom violet and honeysuckle none of them are strong enough to stand out from the fruits and vanilla. This is definitely a fruity perfume.There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base thanks to the constant trickle of peach cherry and vanilla. The grapes [champagne] give DAZZLE another shot of fizzy energy and the patchouli tones down the sweetness so that the blend isn't linear.Scent notes: Pink lady apple maraschino cherry and peach nectar violet petals pink calypso orchid orange blossom vanilla pink champagne white patchouli and musk.***Overall: DAZZLE is 'nice' and is pleasant and easy to wear. I'll mainly stick to wearing it on 'casual' days but you could get away with wearing it to work if you wanted to. Who cares if the bottle says 'Paris Hilton' or 'Robert Piguet'? If the juice is something you like then that is all that matters.It's true that DAZZLE isn't in the slightest bit original but it wears well and it isn't invasive to other people; I wear perfume for me and am not comfortable with it invading other peoples space. Go on and Dazzle me...,Neutral
Really nice overall musk/sweet w/ a hit of cherry.  I love sweet perfumes.  This is a NICE sweet not a bubble gum kid sweet.  I'm in late 's and I'll wear this.  I don't know why people think that once you are older you have to smell old.  Silly.  You can be older and still smell delicious!!  I wear scents for MYSELF.  Not so other people can go &#;gee she needs to smell more like an old lady.&#;  Pfff.Anyway I have about  samples of different perfumes of all types and this one is up at the top.  I also liked Fantasy by Brittany Spears and Florence by Tocca to name a few. Love!  Nice from start to finish and does last longer than most.,Neutral
I decided to try this new perfume because I had wore the others of Paris Hilton. I never smelled it before I just bought it without any recommendation or review. You wouldn't be desappointed if you get it. It has a sweet smell that lasts all day long. So go for it!!! It was what I expected,Neutral
I am a fan of Paris Hiltons frangances. This is my fourth bottle and once again I can say that Paris has brought a delicious perfume essentially a sweet fragrance that lasts a long time in your skin. The bottle design is beautiful very feminine and great for the cost of the perfume. I'm not against celebrities perfumes since what matters is not whether the bottle says Paris Hilton or Prada but the product itself and Dazzle is actually good and feels divine over my skin. Definitely would buy it again. Delicious!,long time
I like this perfume but it's strange. It goes from wayyy too sweet (a strong syrupy cherry smell) to musk very quickly. Almost headache inducing. I wanted to love this but eh. I have to be in a certain weird mood to want to wear this perfume. A little TOO sweet,Neutral
This perfume smells like sexy cotton candy. I love it. It's the best fragrance I've bought in a long time. Love it.,long time
I love this scent! I wear it everyday. The notes stay with me all day. The bottle is awesome. Over all I adore this perfume and I will repurchase. Amazing Scent.,Neutral
I am not a fan of celebrity perfumes usually I think they are horrible and the smell of alcohol never goes away. Ugh. I tried this in a store for the pure novelty of a black liquid which turns clear. I really liked it! I couldn't believe it. I decided to spritz a bit on my wrists and under my ears to test it out and see how long it would last. My husband said he really liked it (he is very picky about fragrances) and it lasted all day so I decided to purchase a bottle. I am very happy with it.It's a little young (if that makes sense... it's sweet and floral) but I'm still in my 's so I feel I can get away with it for now. I don't think I could wear something like this over - though. Great Scent,Neutral
The scent is just what you'd expect from Gaga--mysterious extravagant and intriguingly sexual. I love that it's black and the cap looks like a claw--it reminds me of the days when perfume bottles were art pieces. Love the scent and packaging,Neutral
although im not crazy about this perfume it fades a minute after you put it onthe seller is the best got this faster then the perfume i ordered before this onei will by from them again just not lady gaga not that great,Neutral
From the appearance of this bottle I expected a fragrance that was musky or dark.  But what I got was something bright and fruity-floral!I only use a little so the fragrance doesn't last all day but what a start to my morning.  One spray of Lady Gaga Fame and I'm happy.  It's a beautiful scent.  One that I don't tire of (and one that my family doesn't complain about at all).  It doesn't create a cloud around me like some other fragrances do.  It's very personal and I like it very much.I highly recommend this perfume for anyone who enjoys a fragrance that's on the sweeter side. Gaga for Gag,Neutral
I didn't have high hopes for this perfume since the packaging is so extravagant... but I had a sample of it in a store and absolutely fell in love. Definitely a night time/date night scent! Amazing bottle amazing scent cant go wrong! Smells AMAZING,Neutral
Lady Gaga's music is great but the woman kind of scares me. For that reason I was not expecting to like this fragrance as much as I do. It's actually a great dark spicy fragrance that is quite long-lasting. I was pleasantly surprised. The one thing I do NOT like is the fact that it is black in color. The marketing for this perfume claims that the fragrance turns clear as soon as it is dispensed in the air. Sorry but that is not true. When I sprayed it onto my wrists and neck my skin looked like it had black runny water all over it. I rubbed the fragrance in a bit and the black color disappeared but I would be afraid that I'd end up staining my clothes if I went ahead and bought a big bottle of this stuff. I like it except for the blackness,Neutral
I purchased this for my mom for Christmas. She's a big fan of Victoria Secret perfumes and it reminded me of some of those that she used to wear. She LOVED it. It was wrapped appropriately came in the real box and had the real lid so I am sure it was the actual product and not some kind of scam. The price was phenomenal. Great Gift,Neutral
I personally love this scent.  It's really hard to explain it though which is frustrating for those wanting to read about it.  I hate powdery perfumes a lot... that being said I think a lot of people would say this has a powdery background.  It's not baby powder though it's nice.  It's soft and fades a little too fast but I don't mind reapplying especially because I like it so much.  It also has a sort of fruity/flowery smell on top... I guess.  If you are daring and love different perfumes and scents as much as I do go for it.  If you are picky don't have a wide appreciation of scents and don't like a sweet note avoid it. Love it,Neutral
I purchased this perfume for my  year old daughter for Christmas.  The price is comparable to Department Store prices.  The fragrance comes in a nice large bottle and is the first black liquid perfume that vaporizes clear.  The scent is full and nice.  Lady Gaga Fame is this years must have perfume! A Sought After Product For My -Year-Old Daughter!,Neutral
Lady Gaga famous for her strange wardrobe and catchy songs now she is known for having the first black coloured perfume.The bottle is not black. In fact the colour black you are seeing is the colour of the perfume in a clear bottle.I first smelled this perfume on piece of paper and did not think too highly of it. The second time I sprayed it on my skin and I was amazedat the smell once it settled. Definitely not the same smell I was getting off the paper. I guess it smells better off the skin (which is how it should be).This is a very nice sweet smelling perfume. I was a little surprised because I thought Lady Gaga would go for a dark strong smelling perfume like her image in the media.The best part is that it last's a long time !Side note once you spray the perfume the perfume comes on invisible so you won't have black stains on your clothes and skin. Interesting,long time
I'm not a fan of Gaga but i really liked this scent to me its just very feminine and moderately strong. Very sexy something you wear at night. I love the bottle and the black liquid. I think this will be a perfume that turns into a classic. Really nice,Neutral
I used to use Sephora's daily brush cleaner spray but thought I would give this a try. It works just as well and is about the same price. The only thing I liked about Sephora's daily brush cleaner compared to this one is that it had a milder fragrance. E.l.f.'s product has a very strong perfume like fragrance to it. Many other reviewers seem to really love the smell of this product and it's not that I don't like it I just wish it were a little milder. Luckily it dissipates enough that I don't notice it after a little while but for people who are sensitive to fragrances this should be taken into account before purchasing.I would buy both products and recommend them to other people looking for a good daily brush cleaner at a cheap price. For me I guess the only deciding factor will be which one is more convenient to buy since they are just about the same price. Works well but highly perfumed,Neutral
I have been using this for almost a month.  I don't know why people are so bothered by the smell.  Maybe they are just used to product with a lot of perfume in it.  After it dries my skin looks way better but still waiting to see some permanent results. Verdict not yet,Neutral
The roller is useless and I had to pull it off to get any product.  It is a fairly weak fragrance but it smells really good.  If the perfume were stronger it would be amazing. Arabian Wood roll-on perfume oil,Neutral
I've bought this quite a few times now and I can't live without it! Everyone loves the way I smell and it's great because it's very strong yet subtle at the same time. I was getting tired of the body sprays and perfumes out there especially because I kept having to reapply all the time. I can put a little bit on my hair line behind my ears and I smell the same alllll day. It's great! So awesome!,little bit
I own most of the Nemat fragrance.  However Vanilla Musk is my favorite scent. There is something nurturing about and I always have to have a bottle around me.  It's a 'comfort fragrance to be sure.Although I rececently received a bottle today I forgot to order two and immediately ordered another.Sometimes I mix The Body Shop's Vaniila oil with their White Musk which works.  However TBS discontinued theiir Vanilla perfume and has reforrmulated their White Musk oil to a mere shadow or its former self.Fortunately my standy by...Nemat Vanilla Musk...remains.  Wish they had larger bottles.If you haven't used Vanilla Musk give it a try My All Time Favorite,Neutral
This has been my standby perfume for years and I just keep coming back to it. It smells of vanilla sugar and only a tiny bit of musk. I love it and I'm very happy I can find it on amazon now! my favorite vanilla scent,Neutral
I found another brand of perfume oil here on Amazon that has much better staying power.  This is a wonderful smell so I'll use it to add scent to my body lotions - too much trouble to return. Smell doesn't last as a roll-on.....,Neutral
I really like this perfume. It is differant which is what you would expect from Lady Gaga. It has a lovely clean smell not overpowering at all. My mom loves it too so I would say any woman any age might enjoy it! smells wonderful,Neutral
I'm not going to base my review on what could have been hype or whether I love or hate Lady Gaga (like many other reviews on many sites) but instead this review is on what is actually in front of me...***I don't get why this is being described as a fruity/floral - FAME is definitely something that I would describe as a floriental fragrance. On me there is only the tiniest hint of apricot but it so short lived that it doesn't really make an lasting impression on me. I think some people may be confusing the rich honey accord as apricot grape or similar.The belladonna and incense are the next notes to develop on me which evens out the sweet honey with the spicy dark floral notes. After an hour a lingering sense of liquorice comes though thanks to the saffron and maybe some clove too? I don't really get the whole push-pull malarkey but the fragrance is not linear.Official scent notes: Belladonna incense honey drops saffron apricot jasmine tiger orchid.***I like all of the listed scent notes so I'm very happy with my bottle of FAME; I'm looking at the bottles of my favourite perfumes right now and every key scent note in FAME is amongst them a few times. Couple that with the gothic bottle design and black juice and FAME could have been created for my personal tastes.Whilst FAME does go close to the skin after a couple of hours I still catch lingering wisps throughout the day. When I wore it to bed it was still detectable on my skin the next day. No: FAME doesn't stain skin or clothes. I've even sprayed it directly onto a white t shirt and the liquid does indeed spray clear despite being black in the bottle. Black like the soul of fame...,Neutral
i got the  oz and it smells fantastic.  a little strong at first which is good these days when all the new scents seem to not last but this mellows out within a couple mins and the scent stays around fairly long.  it has blueberry tones initially - it kinda smells like a mix of the old poison perfume mixed with blueberry oil and another lighter floral scent I cant place.  Very subtle once dried.  LOVE IT! love it,Neutral
This perfume is actually quite lovely soft and long lasting on me.  The black tint really does evaporate and spray clear on the skin.  The oz size would probably be the most cost effective since you wouldn't need to use much during the day. It would last you a long time. Gaga for Fame,long time
I must say I was very skeptical about buying this perfume. I went to Macy's one day and asked for a sample and I'm so glad I did! It's absolutely delicious! I later bought a gift set which had the .oz perfume .oz Shower Gel and The .oz Roller Ball. It smells sooo good! The shower gel smells like the perfume but in a clean crisp way. The claw is metal which is pretty cool(The big version). It has belladonna tiger orchidea incense apricot saffron and honey drops. All combined make a fruity seductive scent. It's really a must have. % Satisfied! So Seductive!,Neutral
I recieved a complimentary travel toiletry bag to review.I've used other toiletry bags in the past that were bulky and took up a lot of space to pack.  This bag lays nice and flat in the suitcase.  It holds an incredible amount of items as well.I packed two  oz bottles of shampoo/conditioner in one of the end pockets and still had room to add an electric toothbrush in the same pocket.  In the other end pocket I was able to pack an  oz. bottle of mousse hairbrush full sized tube of toothpaste and a couple hair accessories.  In the open space in the center I was able to pack a handheld mirror razors full sized deodorant my complete cosmetics regime of foundation blush compact two eyeshadow compacts a loose powder compact eyelash curler full sized moisturizer and facial wash.  In the zippered mesh portion of the center flap I was able to fit a large powder brush blush brush eyeshadow brush eyeliner and perfume.  I frankly ran out of things to pack into the bag because I still had room left over!I used the hanging hook on the towel bar in my bathroom and tugged on the bag trying to get it to slip off.  It held on tight.  I played with the zippers and tried to get them to snag and come off track but they held on tight as well.  I pulled on the seams but they are very secure.  All in all I would have no problem recommending this bag to others.  I believe it's well worth the cost in my opinion. Roomiest toiletry bag I have ever used,Neutral
This is a toiletry bag with a larger zippered pocket and three smaller pockets one on one side of the larger pocket and two on the other.  One of these two pockets expands.The larger pocket when zipped open has a hanger to allow the bag to be suspended from a mirror or door.  Another hanger would be nice as this one isn't centered and although the end pockets are supported I wasn't quite sure they were.  The smaller pockets are long enough to hold a toothbrush in a case or a spray bottle of perfume.  I was able to get a toothbrush toothpaste a travel spray bottle of perfume a razor a tube of conditioner a bottle of spray gel and a net puff for the shower in it.The center holds over eight different sizes bottles of shower gel lotion deodorant makeup removing towelettes and various other smaller bottles such as aspirin.  No matter where you put an item you won't have to dig through the case to find it.  No one area is so deep as to lose something.This is a flat type case rather than a duffel bag shape.  After you pack your jean and T-Shirts this case will lay flat like the jeans or shirts.  No need to pack around a box on one end of your suitcase.  If you are looking for a new toiletry bag I would definitely give this one a try. Flat and easy to pack,Neutral
This body wash is super gentle yet works excellent on all your &#;smelly parts&#;. I paid about   dollars here on Amazon for  large bottles. It may have been a special so mark this to your wish list and watch the price. I checked at Walgreens and it is running close to  dollars for just one bottle. What I really like about it is that after all of us take a shower in the same day there is no soap scum -- not even around the drain. It rinses really well. The chamomile smell is very faint so it won't make guys smell perfume-y and us girls can use our favorite smelly body lotion without changing its scent. Good stuff,Neutral
This was possibly the best $ I ever spend in my entire life. This item I have used constantly since I got it many  many months ago and it has held up it is made very sturdy the zippers are almost impossible to destroy  the many pockets have not ripped .This thing is worth it's weight in gold if you are like me and religiously switch out your handbags to match your outfits .This bag for the bag fits into my smallest trapeze shoulder bag and makes my largest tote organized. You know there your stuff is with the two secure zippered sections  the outside has deep pockets  on top of those are more mesh pockets so you see what you need let's say you want to carry your rollerball perfumes makeup for touch ups etc.  its easy to find and best of all.... If you do have something that spills  it will not ruin your precious bag ! Can't live without this!,Neutral
Cotz Pediatric Sunscreen is SPF .  The tube is . ounces and it is not an inexpensive product.  However sunscreen is important especially for youngsters.  The product is % Zinc Oxide. The rest of the ingredients (listed below) are unremarkable.  What is nice is there are no perfumes no dyes and no parabens.  The sunscreen protection itself is natural.  Just keep in mind there are numerous synthetic chemicals in the cream as well. To me the absence of dyes fragrance and parabens makes this product a nice choice for young children or for anyone especially for application on the face.  The manufacturer recommends the product for ages  months and up.IngredientsZinc Oxide (%). C- Alkyl Benzoate Caprylhydroxyamic Acid Caprylyl Glycol Cetyl PEG/PPG / Dimethicone Cyclohexasiloxane Cyclopentasiloxane Dimethicone Dimethicone Crosspolymer Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer Dimethiconol Disodium EDTA Glycerin Lauryl PEG/PPG / Methicone Methicone PEG- Dimethicone Polyhydroxystearic Acid Polysorbate  Retinyl Palmitate Sodium Chloride Stearyl Dimethicone Tetrahexadecyl Ascorbate Tocopheryl Acetate and Triethanolamine.The product goes on smoothly is not greasy and rubs in clear without leaving a cloudy or white residue on the skin.I like this product as a sunscreen for youngsters and a facial sunscreen for anyone. Let The Sun Shine In! But Not The UV....,Neutral
I have overly sensitive skin and use may baby products as they are either unscented or lightly scented and contain few irritants in their chemical composition.This sunscreen is my new favourite as it is invisible and so far has not caused any rash nor additional breakouts on my face neck or inner arms.  I often break out in acne after getting hives from an allergic reaction to many perfumes and chemicals common in face products.  As this is sunscreen it has performed relatively well in that I have not been sunburnt over the course of the past mini heatwave this week.  I have tanned (but not burnt) this is not the product to reply on if you are looking to prevent a tan.My current brand is from the Cancer Council of Australia but this is a close second and I will use this as it is easier to get here in the US. Invisible. medium weight and unscented.,sensitive skin
My wife is currently pregnant and she is trying to avoid all sorts of chemicals.  She really likes this product because it is non greasy and seems to work well.  If it is gentle enough for a baby we figure it is perfect for a mother expecting.  It has no perfumes or dyes.  It is a bit pricey but then again Cotz makes good products.  Any body of any age can use this. Wife Loves It,Neutral
My partner and I both have sensitive skin and really hate the chemical and commercial scents used in so many sun blocks and sunscreens. I also feel strongly about using a mineral sunblock as opposed to a sunscreen because I've read that sunscreens actually only protect from certain types of rays and let the most harmful types of rays through to your skin.While I'm having a baby soon and expect to put this sunscreen to good use on him since I spend a lot of time outside in the garden I tested it out initially on myself and my partner since we are pretty fussy about our sun protection products.We both loved it and my partner deemed it the best sunblock ever because it stuck to his skin without feeling at all greasy it obviously worked very well and after about two minutes the scent completely dissipated. I was also impressed. Many sun blocks end up failing because they try to do too much. I don't want a lotion I don't want a perfume I just want sun protection. This particular product provided great protection from a very hot day and was so unobtrusive that I forgot I was wearing it which is something I have never said about another brand of sunblock lotion. Best sunblock ever even for grown-ups.,sensitive skin
We live in the high desert in South Cal.  Because of the altitude and dryness the sun is pretty intense.  You can a sunburn quicker and more painful than you would on the beach.  When through into the mix that my wife is allergic to a number of perfumes facial creams and host of chemicals it makes it a little difficult to find a sunscreen that works and will not irritate.  So when this became available on the Vine and was considered pediatric safe we ordered a sample.  My wife thinks this is a great product.  It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave a greasy/slippery feel.  Also she doesn't go around smelling like a coconut or banana.  I like coconuts and bananas but for some strange reason she doesn't want to go around smelling like one...go figure.  Bottom line the product works for her and she's happy.  It appears to work well on that sensitive area...the nose.  Her nose always...always burns...during the summer she always looks like she's competing with Rudolph...so far...Rudolph is far ahead in the red nose race...good for her....good for me. Great Product,great product
I really love this item for the lack of perfumes in it. Great for campers and backpackers. I think they should expand their marketing as perfume free items for the outdoors can be hard to find. great product,great product
Dove has just introduced a new line of hair and body wash products.This line is not as heavily perfumed as other brands namely Axe.  I have a few samples from the Men's Care line and it's most certainly a different feel than the other off-the-shelf brands.I used this specifically for my face and body and used the Sensitive Scalp  in --shampoo and conditioner for my hair.The combination of both products is very impressive.  Clean without that dried-out feeling.A very good line of products that Dove's produced. Dove's Men's Care Fresh Awake.,Neutral
Dove's Fresh Awake body wash has a good subtle fragrance that I like.I'm a bar soap guy. I just like a nice big bar of soap and a soft wash cloth for clean up time. This body wash stuff ah just don't like it. I hate hotels that don't have a bar of soap and make me use that liquid stuff. Well oddly I just changed my mind with this Dove wash. It probably won me over with the smell. A little bit citrus a little bit good smells. Not too strong that I smell like a perfume factory afterwards. This Dove soap makes a pretty good lather a lot like my trusty bars of soap. There is something in this soap that tingles on my face like a good cleaning. The soap rinses off nicely without leaving a residue.The container is just weird and has taken me a long time to get used to the whole upside down flip cap close it back up and set it down upside down. I can't figure out why Dove made the top pointy so I can't set it down cap up. At first it seemed like there was no way to control the amount of soap. Turns out the soap doesn't dribble out by itself but you have to squeeze it out.Yeah I like this soap. I'm surprised. Now This I Like,little bit
I am comparing both the Fresh Awake and Clean Defense body and face washes by Dove.  I Have tried both so I figured it would be good to compare them.Winter really dries my skin out so I was interested to see if both would help with that problem. Both seem to help a bit and I like the smell and feel of both products.They both look sort of like shave gels I have used.  The both feel nice on the skin.Fresh Awake has more of a manly scent than a perfume scent. It is more energizing than calming. It is something I would associate with use in the morning rather than before going to bed. I did not notice much of a scent after I was done showering.Clean Defense has less of powerful scent. I have used this at night when I want to shower before bed.  It seems to fight dry skin and oil build up well. It feels great on my skin. When I am finished with my shower I notice even less of a scent than with Fresh Awake.Both seem to help with my dryness though Clean Defense seems to work a bit better. Both work well as body wshes. I have tried each for about two weeks. Both are fine products. Both the Fresh Awake and Clean Defense Body and Face Washes by Dove Work Well,dry skin
California Breeze Bath Salts  pound Luxury size is the perfect gift for a good friend.  I say gift because if you are purchasing for yourself it is wise to buy a much larger bag!  The price of this gift bag is comparable to other  ounce bath salts of this type.The scent is lovely:  a blend of flowers that is neither cloying nor unmemorable.  This fragrance would be lovely as an accompanying roll on oil so that the scent of the bath is enhanced and sticks with you all day.  What a pleasant substitute for heavy and expensive perfumes!  Even after finishing off the salts I have kept the bag just to remind myself of the refreshing scent.  Very nice.The salts are tinted blue so when you do add them to your bath water the water does change color.  However this does not mean that the tub will wear a blue ring afterwards.  I used these salts about four times and have had no incidence of tub discoloration.The salts do soften the skin and provide a wonderfully luxurious sense of stress relief.  I found myself wanting to linger in the bath well beyond the point where the water was becoming cool and my skin going into prune mode.  Not a problem!  My skin felt soft and smooth afterwards as if I had rubbed it with a sugar/salt rub rich with emollients.  The scent does linger for as long as it possible can--again that oil roll-on would come in handy to prolong the entire experience.The San Francisco Salt Company sent me a complimentary bag of this in exchange for an honest review.Bottom line?  Looking for a lovely gift that the recepient cannot fail to love?  Try the San Francisco Salt Company!  Bathing in California Breeze Bath Salts will result in frequent California Dreaming!  These Bath Salts are lightly scented with a delicious floral blend that is a treat in itself.  Add to that a mixture of sea salt glycerin and aloe vera and you've got stress relief in a tub.  The price is comparable to other brands; the experience exceeds them.  Recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behrenreneofc Soft Fragrance Luxurious Experience,Neutral
What makes a bath salt great?  I never really thought about it before.  But wanting to review this bath salt from SF Salt Company prompted me to do so.  What senses are brought into play when using a bath salt?  Your sense of smell surely; your sense of touch and sight.  This California Breeze does a fine job with these three senses.  And then there is another sense:  That of well-being.  This product certainly succeeded in lifting mine!The smell is heavenly:  I catch hints of tangy citrus lush and ripe mango blossoming fruit trees lily-of-the-valley and something else fresh and clean.  It's not a cloying smell; it's not a cheap perfume smell.  It smells rich and classy.  I love the smell of this salt!  Of course it hits you as you open the package but it is a lasting smell too.  It lasts throughout your bath and leaves a gentle light fragrance on the skin.  It doesn't last forever though and I found that it did not interfere with my perfume.  I also put this bath salt into a large pan of water to soak my feet:  The smell drifting up from the hot water was so luxurious and calming!Your sense of touch is affected in several ways:  The glycerin and aloe in this product seems to make the water just glide over your body.  Yes I know water alone does just that but this is a different kind of smooth liquid glide and it takes the feeling to a different level.  There is a variety of salt crystal sizes in the bag:  Some dissolve quickly some retain their edges for a good while--allowing you to use the salt as a buff.  Not having used bath salts before I was amazed how smooth my skin felt after applying a spoonful onto my bath mitt along with my bath gel.  The roughness of the crystals feels so good and rubbed in the right places it feels so invigorating.The color of the crystals is blue and a little darker than the packaging.  It's a pretty translucent color and somehow matches the smell.  Together the sight and smell of this product as it dissolves in your bath provide a very pleasant experience.I know it's hard to picture how this product smells just by a written description because you have to take my adjectives and interpret them through your own perspective.  But I think there is one thing I can say about this product's smell:  It's not going to offend anyone's nose.  There is nothing outlandish in this product and it is a combination of smells that we all know and like.  You can't go wrong trying out a  pound bag.I received a sample of this product from SF Salt Company.  A representative thought I would enjoy the experience.  I was not pressured to write a review.A safety observation:  When you use this product in your bath you should either rinse it out very well or alert the next person using it.  The glycerin is a bit slippery.  This is especially important if there are elderly persons using the bath. This bath salt fills my senses and makes me feel good!,Neutral
Back in the s when I was in college I treated myself to a couple of packets of mineral bath salts I ran across in my local drug store.  I absolutely loved the fragrance the light blue color of my bath water and most importantly the relaxed feeling it provided after a long warm tub soaking.  If I had known I would never be able to find those packets again I would have stocked up on them.  I've used many bubble baths bath oils and other bath salts over the years but I've never found the duplicate of those wonderful bath minerals.  Till now!When I picked up this lb bag of California Breeze Bath Salts and took a whiff of the scent it took me back  years.  It's hard to describe the fragrance but I would have named it South Seas Soak or Bahama Breeze Bath!  It just isn't like any other scent on the market.  Not perfume-like sweet...not musky.  I'd have to call it an earthy floral.  Of course when it's dissolved in a tub of water the fragrance is light yet lingering.  I use a bit more than the handful called for but then I have a large jacuzzi tub.You'll love the way these bath salts scent the water but you'll also love how they make the water feel soft and silky.  Your skin is left feeling soft and lightly scented.  Even your bathroom will smell great!  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys soaking and relaxing. The bath salt I've been looking for,Neutral
I love this perfume. It's the perfect &#;age&#; of sent for me. I don't feel like a kid wearing roll on &#;art stuff&#; glitter from Bath and Body Works (remember that stuff?!) and at the same time it's not grandmother-y at all.It helps that my husband is a huge fan of Taylor Swift-but he loves it too.Only complaint is that the top doesn't stay on very well. I would hate to lose it too it's so pretty! Not too young not too old!,Neutral
My daughter loves Taylor Swift and when she saw this perfume she wanted it. She had a sample from a magazine and was crazy about it. Bought it for her birthday and she is thrilled. Even my wife uses it occasionally. Love it,Neutral
Because the scent of perfume changes somewhat with your body chemistry after wearing for awhile my criteria for evaluation is whether anyone else tells me how good I smell when I wear it.  I tried the original Wonderstruck and liked it but no one told me I smelled good.  After trying Enchanted however I received many compliments on my fragrance.  In my opinion it is not quite as heavy a fragrance as the blue bottle and isn't overpowering but lasts throughout the day well.  It is not too musky and not too floral but a nice combination. The bottles of both fragrances are beautiful. I Get Compliments!,Neutral
I bought this for my wife who is in her 's and we both love it.  The scent is definitely sweet and the berries and passion fruit definitely stand out.  My wife describes it as a &#;young and fun&#; scent but also sophisticated enough that a woman of any age can wear it.  The scent lingers a nice long time as well which is a good thing.The only negative thing my wife had to say about the product was that the bottle was hard for her to handle.  Her hands are a bit on the small side and the bottle is fairly large and shaped a bit like a grenade.  She said she needs to use two hands to apply the perfume.  Not a big deal but anyone buying this as a gift for a younger girl may want to keep it in mind.The bottom line is this is a nice smelling long lasting perfume that I like better than some costing  or  times as much.  Definitely recommended. A Sweet Fun Scent For All Ages,Neutral
I tried this perfume at Macy's right after it came out it didn't scream at me like other perfumes have. I got a sample of this perfume a few weeks later and after I put it on my skin and let it sit for awhile then I smelled it and it smelled way better than I remembered. This perfume can be hard to smell at times. This perfume is very light. This perfume is magical. This is one of my favorite new perfumes. I buy a lot of perfume. My favorites are the celebrity's. I'm so glad she released another perfume. I did like Wonderstruck but I prefer this one more. I think you could wear this all year long. This perfume I was really excited about after I received a sample in the mail. When I smell perfume sometimes in the store they don't always catch me at hello it might be because there is so many other perfumes there so sometimes you can't smell them. This perfume is defiantly different than the original Wonderstruck. I just can't get enough of this smell. I do wish it was a bit stronger because that's the way I like it. In my opinion this perfume is unique it doesn't smell like any other perfume I have smelled before. Wonderstruck Enchanted is Magical,Neutral
Wonderstruck Enchanted is a haunting fragrance! It possibly will become one of my great favorites before long.This is the first day I am wearing it so I cannot know yet.It was a recent gift from the holidays. :)I do not follow celebrities when they create perfumes and never have. Am I weird?This is the first celebrity fragrance I have ever owned!If someone would like to explain to me what the appeal of a celebrity's name vis a vis a design house which specializes in creating perfumes is PLEASE help me out! I do not mean to be derogatory but it honestly makes me want a scent less if it has some personality's name on it. I must be REALLY OLD. That's gotta be it!However I bought this choosing it myself using a gift card.Admittedly it was not just because of the description of the scent.I bought it also because of the GREAT eighties retro look of the bottle with the adorable charms. The staggeringly passionate magenta-pink color of the bottle really appealed to me as well. It looks enticing like a pomegranate!Packaging CAN be important expecially in luxury items like perfume.That is all for naught however if you don't like the fragrance of course!I had no scent on before I sprayed it on. I sprayed it on my hand after I was freshly showered (good for you jeannie!).I then rubbed it briskly up my arm. I did this because my husband was IN THE WAY the whole time and I couldn't get to the bottle in the regular manner!!! haha!!! It is not a new way of smelling scent people!At any rateI have had it on for four hours now and my husband has grabbed me twice in a romantic fashion out of the blue!!! He LOVES it. He has a very discerning sense of smell. He used to collect vintage men's perfumes. He also gave me many of my favourites for years.I am giving it four stars just for HIS reaction! Guy loves girl=great! I am giving it my fifth star because the woody base notes really get to me -- I do not smell the top notes as much as the base notes.I LOVE the way this wears so far.I AM enchanted with Wonderstruck Enchanted.Put my review in the Crazy for it! category!best wishes jean Adore this Sensual Fragrance Wonderstruck Enchanted!,Neutral
This perfume smells so good. It is very sweet which is what I love about it. I'm not a fan of Taylor Swift's music but I am very much in to her perfume. Smells so good,Neutral
This perfume has a very pretty scent. It's has a pretty sweet undertone to it but it doesn't smell like candy. On me has a little more vanilla to it with.And since it is very light it's perfect for the daytime. It fades a little be throughout the day because it's so light. But it's a very nice smelling fragrance.Light. Girly. Sweet. Very pretty very light,Neutral
I like this perfume. It's surprisingly sophisticated. It smells best when you have JUST put it on but after maybe  minutes basically all you smell is vanilla. I really like vanilla so the scent for me is enjoyable but if you do not like vanilla then I would definitely NOT get this perfume. I'm not a huge fan of the packaging but honestly it's not that big of a deal to me. Nice Vanilla Scent,Neutral
the weight for me is just right it's not heavy or light to put on your head. the only thing is the smell of metal so I spray it with some perfume to get rid of it.. works great nice little hairclip,Neutral
I tried this after smelling a sample in one of those magazines and it's a very pleasant &#;manly&#; smell. It's a change from what my husband usually wears and it's nice to have a choice as I do with the  perfumes I use. Good stuff! Wonderful Fragrance!,Neutral
This is a great way to carry perfume on the go.  Instead of lugging around a whole big container of perfume just pump this little thing up a few times and your good to go.  Can also be used for men for cologne if you want.  To rinse just pump in water and then squirt out.  Great little thing to have even in your purse or car. Great for travel,Neutral
Bought this to keep in my purse works wonderfully! Easy to pump any perfume or body spray into it! This would make great gift! Love this,Neutral
I love this thing! For the past few months I've been absolutely addicted to perfumes. I've been collecting them like crazy spraying up to  different scents on myself throughout the day depending on my moods.  With this traveling spray bottle I can carry one of my favorite scents with me wherever I go! When I first got it I thought it was going to be complicated but the spray nozzles come off and reattach to all my perfume bottles easily I've had no problem with the hole at the bottom of the travel spray leaking and it's nice and small so I can stick it anywhere in my purse. Works perfect! DEFINITELY PURSE-WORTHY!!!,Neutral
Very good product. No leaks so far. I have several of these for different perfumes (I travel a lot!) :) Good product no leaks,Neutral
I fly for a living and love expensive perfume. These two things don't mix typically until now.  Done are my days of leaky bottles and wasted perfume. I will say that if you spray at a high altitude it leaks a tiny tiny bit after landing but is corrected by one spray to equalize the pressure in the bottle. In fact leak is probably the wrong word the sprayer is a little wet. I loved this little bottle so much that I have recommended it to my fellow flight attendants.UPDATE: After using it for some time I have a warning for those that travel by air. Do not use it while on the airplane during the flight. The pressurization causes it to leak a tiny bit around the sprayer. Other than that it works wonderfully so I'm leaving my  star rating. Great for frequent travelers,Neutral
Got this for my mom and she LOVES it! She would carry her huge bottle of perfume in the car with her but now she can fill this up with her favorite scent and take it anywhere no leakage at all! Brilliant invention,Neutral
It was simple to use and it really works I used one of my favorite perfumes. However I am unsure of how to clean the perfume inside Really Works,Neutral
SO SO SO happy I purchased these.Leave your BIG bottles at home and get this pump!! Got a few family members perfume and cologne for Christmas and now they can take it with them easily. Even my husband wanted one for his cologne for me to take with us on vacation and keep in my purse but he could have easily kept it in his pocket. Lighter sized not bulky. Classy and well made. Will be buying more for gifts again i am sure. Friends I told about this gift to are interested in purchasing these also. Glad to have an Honest Reliable seller to deal with. Happy shopping. Wonderful for travel everyday take your favorite scent with you wherever you go,Neutral
I break out a lot with my current BB cream so I wanted to try something else and I bought this product because I was looking for a BB cream that was more natural than most. Other reviewers said that this product left your skin orange looking though but I bought it anyway.The cream doesn't irritate my skin and it has a nice citrus smell at first but then it smells more like strong perfumed makeup throughout the day. I wouldn't mind the smell but it is so strong and lasts for a long time...I just don't like it. So I try not to apply it so much near my nose. Also it doesn't' conceal as much as my other BB cream and it does have a mild orange tint to it so I just rub it in really well and then lightly apply a mineral powder over the top.Overall I like the cream. I do like the way it feels...its light and not too greasy and it spreads well over your entire face so a little goes a long way. I like that the ingredients are nontoxic as well. It would be better though If they could just get rid of the orange tint and smell and made it conceal a little better. It's Okay...I LIKED it.,long way
Love this perfume it smells great and lasts all day.  I've received alot of compliments. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Love it,Neutral
Like the perfume but the scent does not last long. I wish it would stay long if it would than I would be satisfied with the scent. unsatisfied,Neutral
Vintage Bloom stands apart from most modern fragrances because while there are lemon and lime topnotes they fade on the dry down so overall it is not too citrusy or spicy. At first it smells like you just opened a box of lemon Jell-o or a Mountain Dew but that fades quickly.And there are no strong berry notes which have really been overdone in modern perfumes. Berry has jumped the shark.So many scents today open like a produce stand and then smell like a bakery (which can be great but it is pretty common). Maybe that explains the name vintage. This scent quotes perfumes of earlier times in which florals dominated. So it opens like a produce stand and ends like a florist's. Definitely notes of the cut green stems in a bouquet as well as some understated blooms such as peony. This scent changes as you wear it revealing peach at times but not an 's peachiness. Because it is not swimming in vanilla it does not produce a headache at least on me.Vintage here does not mean old timeworn or dated. Don't be put off by the name. This scent is new not like the  year old bottle of Joy in your grandmother's closet. It is comforting like that cashmere cardigan next to the bottle of Joy. Fresh floral,Neutral
I love this perfume. It reminds me of spring and summer and would be a perfect one to wear for those seasons. Of course it is very floral and fresh. That is what I love about it and the price is really great too. It got to my school fast also. This perfume is beautiful!,Neutral
I'll start by saying that I'm a skeptic when it comes to these expensive skin cremes that are supposed to make you look younger healthier and so on.  I tried this product on a lark and found it to be quite pleasant to use nicely scented but not overly perfumed and it worked as advertised.  Yes your skin is moisturized and feels softer after a few days of use.  Not exactly ground breaking though as I've used Neutrogena and Nivea products that are a tenth of the price and give me the same results. Is this a good product? Yes. Is it worth the high price tag? I just don't see a difference between the results.  for my money I still prefer usingNivea Creme . Oz ( G) (Pack Of ). The Nivea is actually less oily and absorbs into the skin quicker. Decent product But High Cost May Outweigh Benefits,Neutral
Count me in among the other reviewers who found the fragrance of this cream too much to bear.  I am all for a good scent when appropriate but subtlety is crucial when dealing with facial lotions.  After applying this to my face I felt like I'd taken a bath in perfume.  It actually threw off my sense of smell and was thoroughly unpleasant.  I think that's why I generally like Nivea mens facial care products; if they do have any scent it is so light that it is not offensive.My skin did seem softer and less shiny after use or so my wife commented so it has that going for it.During application I also found the cream to be a bit more like a lotion and actually kind of watery.  At this price point I was expecting something superior.So overall I'd give this a 'meh' rating. STRONG Fragrance,Neutral
This is not a complex product requiring a lot of explanation... it is simply a good moisturizer..... but loses a star for value due to the high cost.This is a nice cream it goes on smoothly soaks in without feeling slick on the skin and legitimately makes the skin *feel* good.The fragrance is nice and subtle a touch floral but not perfumey.  People won't likely notice it unless you direct them to it.The cost is prohibitive however.  You can probably get a cream you like almost as much at a supermarket or drug store for $ or less.If price were no object I would buy and use this product.  It's quality makes me wish I could afford to.  Some will but I do wonder how big the high-end men's moisturizer market is. Feels good but at that price?,Neutral
This two piece set includes a moisturizer for the face and body cream. I like the anti-aging moisturizer for the face but was not at all impressed with the body cream. The moisturizer has a pleasantly mild and gentle fragrance and has a consistency between a lightweight cream and a gel. In a couple of weeks it has already calmed my problem dry winter cheeks but is light and absorbent for the rest of my face as well and does not make my forehead feel oily. It makes a great day cream. It absorbs quickly and I like that I don't have to wait before I apply my foundation. It is a generous size and packaged in an attractive sturdy jar. I am all around quite pleased with it and expect it will last me through winter.The body cream on the other hand has a cheap feel to it both in the packaging and the products. The first thing I noticed is there are at least  parabens in the lotion! It smells strong and perfumey and it is so thin that when you open the tube it practically runs out on its own. It is not fitting of the label Hydra and Luxe as stated on the package which I would expect to be more hydrating and thicker. Skip the body cream. If you want to try this line stick with the moisturizer for your face only and you should be pleased. Moisturizer good body cream a disappointment,Neutral
I've mainly used the face cream.  I have a bit of sagging and some lines around the mouth and wrinkles under my eyes because of my lack of estrogen and now am trying to repair it.  I eat healthy but felt I needed some outward help as well as inward.  What I can say about this cream is after you put it on your face is incredibly smooth and silky. I do not have any problems with the smell and I do have sensitivity to some perfumed products so not sure why the other reviewer had problems with this.  It's non greasy.  I've not tried it long enough to attest to it's benefits on wrinkles but mine are bad so anything should help but it makes me feel good to use it maybe it will keep them from getting worse.  I'm . Makes my skin soooo soft,Neutral
This set of body cream and anti-aging face cream is beautifully boxed and the products are definitely luxurious indulgences.  The body cream leaves arms and legs feeling soft and silky.  The face cream hydrates superbly without being too oily.  My only issue with this item is that both products are highly fragranced and perfumey.  I prefer either unscented or very softly scented lotions so the fragrance was a turn off for me.  My mother tried this when she came to visit and she loved the fragrance so I'm sure it's just a personal taste issue.  This is a rather pricey product as well.  I don't spend this much on face or body cream and would not have tried this except that it was offered on Amazon Vine.  Is it worth the listed price?  I really don't think so.  I didn't find it to be any better than products that cost / as much.  That being said if you really want to pamper yourself or give yourself a beauty treat this might be what you're looking for. Luxurious but Overly Fragranced.,Neutral
This AINHOA Gift Set comes in an attractive box boasting an impressive list of ingredients that I can't pronounce along with the exotic sounding Caviar Extract.  I had big expectations which were for the most part fulfilled aside from a couple of small problems.  I have been using the face cream and body cream for about a week and have experienced significant improvement with some problem dry skin areas.The face cream is a small . fl oz container.  I must say that a little seems to go a long way so I expect this container to last for quite a while. The cream has a nice thick texture that applies smoothly.  After applying twice per day I have noticed markedly smoother skin and an elimination of the dry patches that always appear courtesy of our wonderful Midwestern winter.  My one problem with this cream is the scent.  I feel that it is far too strong and I certainly would not recommend it for any user who is sensitive to perfumes.The body cream comes is a . fl oz container and is very thin.  Once again the scent is overpowering and unlike the face cream I don't feel like this lotion will last very long.  It comes out fast and takes quite a bit to cover an area.  Even with these problems I have no complaints about the moisturizing results.  This lotion has greatly improved my winter skin problems and while I have not noticed anything that would enable me to address this product's firming and anti-cellulite claims the moisturizing benefits have been quite impressive.Finally I must add that even though I feel that the scent for both the face cream and the body cream is far too strong; my husband thinks it smells terrific.  A four star rating for two products that work very well but still have a few issues. Works well but still a couple of issues,long way
I guess I am the lone voice reviewing this product that likes it!I've been using both the face lotion and the body lotion for a little more than a week.  I am always skeptical about things like this anything that claims to remove wrinkles brighten skin etc.  I am very fair skinned (red hair blue eyes) so every wrinkle blemish etc. shows up especially in winter when I'm even more pale than normal.I set about using this in the most scientific way I knew how:  by keeping track of my skin tone fine lines around my eyes and ruddy/red spots starting the day I first used this.  I didn't change anything else (eating the same sleeping the same etc).The first thing I noticed about the lotion was the scent.  It does not in ANY way smell like baby lotion as one reviewer mentioned.  I have had lots of babies in my life and am very VERY familiar with the smell of baby products.  In fact my  year old still likes to use baby lotion to moisturize her skin so it was easy for me to compare.  I agree the scent is very noticeable....at first.  It fades within about  minutes.  To me it has a sort of fruit/floral scent.  Not good or bad it's just there.  My husband says he doesn't notice it at all.But the best thing about it is my skin!  After three days I absolutely noticed the fine lines around my eyes are FAR less noticeable.  It is a marked difference.  In fact I've had several people who know me well ask me what is different about me - that I look well rested like I've just been on vacation (and trust me I have NOT - I just had all  of my children home for two weeks from school for Christmas break - anything but well rested!!)The face cream is a very light lotion.  It is in a pot (and honestly I couldn't care less about the hygiene issue I wash my hands and tons of products come in pots like this) and it takes very little to spread on my face and the effect is immediate.  My skin feels incredibly soft and smooth like baby skin (yes really).  The skin tone is brighter more of a peaches & cream complexion it looks amazing.  The consistency of the face lotion reminds me of very thin yogurt.  But a little goes a long way.  I use it on my face neck the backs of my hands and d&eacute;colletage area.The body lotion is a bit different.  It also has a similar scent but once again the scent fades very quickly.  I've had no problems using the lotion and my usual perfume.  The body lotion is also very thin so a little goes a long way.  I usually useAlba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion Maximum Dry Skin Formula -Ounce Bottlewhich is very thick and creamy it takes awhile to get it all rubbed in and to stop feeling sticky.  The AINHOA body cream went on smooth and very quickly and again my skin feels like a newborns.  I took special notice in a weird dry patch I had on my elbow NOTHING was working on it.  After three days of using this lotion the dry patch is almost gone.I am a frugal person and actually had no clue there was body and face lotion in this price range because it never even occurred to me to shop for it.  I useLubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion  Ounceon my face which is under the $ range.  So to try something this expensive was quite a treat.  Even more surprising is that after the results I've actually entertained the idea of buying more of the face lotion after it runs out.  Anyone that knows me would know that is indeed a very positive endorsement.Long story short:  I am fair skinned in my 's dry skin younger looking for my age but still have fine lines and I really REALLY liked these products.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again if the price was more in line with my budget.**UPDATE**Ok I've been using this for several weeks now and I've noticed that there is an odor to it that was becoming more and more unpleasant the more I used it.  I couldn't put my finger on what it was because the overall scent of the lotions are good.  Then it hit me one day:  fish.  It smells like fish.I hate fish.  I can't stand the smell of fish/seafood etc.  I can't take fish oil tablets because of the fishy smell I hate eating in seafood restaurants because of the smell (I do it out of love for my seafood loving family).  So rubbing fish smell on my body and face was becoming an issue for me because now that's ALL I smell when using it.  And it's a shame because I REALLY like how the lotion makes my skin feel!  I looked at the ingredients and sure enough they use caviar essential oils in the potions.  I'm not saying the fish smell is overpowering but if you're someone with a SUPER sensitive nose who also can't stand the smell of aquatic delicacies on your person all day you might want to pass on this even though it's some of the best lotion I've ever used. I like it *update*,long way
The facial cream is nice -- it goes on smoothly and absorbs quite well and is not greasy.  It does a great job of moisturizing but I haven't noticed any firming benefits as the manufacturer claims.  It has a perfumey scent that I would rather not have.The body cream also moisturizes well (again no firming).  A little bit goes a long way.  The big drawback to the body cream is the overpowering perfume smell.  It is STRONG!  I dislike that very much.Both products are good moisturizers but these are much too expensive for that purpose.  You can get those benefits from other products at a fraction of the price and without the overpowering smell. Moisturizes Well But That's All,little bit
I received this set and I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in it.  The scent was way too strong and wasn't very pleasant in my opinion. The scent stayed with me for a long time so I couldn't wear my own perfume or it would have clashed.  I would really prefer to choose my own perfume and not have a scent chosen for me and included in a body cream.  I think the creams should be unscented or scented with a soft clean scent.  This smelled like old pungent perfume.The moisturizing qualities of the body lotion were also disappointing.  It says body cream but it's thin and not very creamy.  After I applied it I could not tell that I had used anything at all.The facial cream was also strongly scented.  I liked the way it felt but I don't think it was any better than drug store brands. The size of the facial cream was very generous and I think it would last at least  months.  I mention that because another reviewer thought it was a  week supply.  However I won't finish the products because I strongly dislike the scent. Average product but the scent is way too strong,long time
Packaged in an attractive zippered white faux leather case this skin care duo is encased in metal tubes. The Extreme Plus Repair has a roller ball tip while the Extreme Eclat Instant has a soft sable brush at the end of the container. Product is dispensed by pressing a button at the bottom of the tube. One or two presses was sufficient for my needs.The Extreme Plus Repair contains algae exptracts bioplasma marine plant dna and Hyaluronic Acid. The Extreme Eclat contains ginseng fruit acids vitamins plant and algae extracts.Frankly I was more impressed with the applicators than I was with the product. The applicators are fun to use and assist in precision application. The roller ball is reputed to assist with lymphatic drainage. The brush had a nice soft feel. After about two weeks of use I found the Eclat somewhat more effective than the Plus Repiar. The eclat had a light perfume scent that I did not care for and the results were subtle. It does leave the skin smooth and soft with minimal tightening. The Plus Repair had no scent and its effects to date were unremarkable.  I did not experience any irritation or allergic reactions and I do have sensitive skin. However I cannot say that the results thus far are superior to even the drug store brands.  I intend to completely use both and will update my review if that changes.On the negative side the instructions are skimpy and are contained on a little leaflet. the leaflet has information on all of their products and in a number of languages. It was annoying to have to weed through all the langauages and products to find the english instructions. and then the information provided was minimal.  I also noted that the tubes were not sealed in any manner. Although they are attractive the metal tube and brush of the Eclat fell apart. I was able to put it back together but it does raise questions about overall quality.This product is worth a try if you temper your expectations. I did not experience amazing and instant improvement but was not displeased with the results. The applicators are genius easy and fun. The carrying case is cute and sturdy and the black interior and small mirror were thoughtful touches. If amazon had half stars I would give this three and one-half for superior application of a pedestrian product. Nifty Applicators Average Performance,Neutral
It's too early for me to tell if this really diminishes wrinkles; I'll update my review later. The AINHOA specific product did seem to have an almost immediate tightening feeling on my face but nothing dramatic (time will tell though). The packaging of the product is great. It comes with a nice carrying case that has a mirror so it's perfect for traveling. The applicators make it much easier to apply than the traditional bottle moisturizers.  My only minor complaint is that the extreme instant product smells strongly of perfume and I prefer beauty products that are unscented.UPDATE //: I stopped using the product because I had a reaction to it.  The skin around my eye swelled and stayed that way for about a week. Don't see any miracles yet but the product seems nice,Neutral
I was excited for the opportunity to sample and review one of the high end facial products but that quickly turned to disappointment.  I do not have sensitive skin but one use and I had red blotches across my forehead. The scent was very strong almost perfumed rather than just scented. Why is that even needed on a facial product? I'll continue to try the products on my hands to use them up but this is not a product i would ever pay for or recommend. Oil of Olay is a better bet for your money don't waste it on this stuff. Irritating,sensitive skin
Based on a week's use of AINHOA Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum I am in love with this product.  Maybe it was because I was using an over the counter facial lotion but after using this serum I noticed the dry patches on my face disappeared and my oily patches were not so oily.  Bliss!  I also use a Clarisonic to clean my face so the lotion absorbs quickly and doesn't feel oily on my skin.  I also enjoy the scent of this serum - it's flowery but not so overpowering that I feel like I'm walking through a perfume department.So far my skin is feeling smoother softer and looks clean and dewy after using it.  I thankfully have not had any problems with breakouts with this product.  I cannot say how well it will work in the long run but I'm hoping my skin stays like this (or gets better!) within the  month period.  For now highly recommended! My Skin Feel Sooooo Soft!,Neutral
First off thank you to the folks at Amazon Vine for giving me the chance to try this product. I'm generally pretty frugal when it comes to skin care so I'll jump at the chance to sample the high end stuff.The caviar serum comes nicely packaged in a pretty silvery box wrapped in plastic wrapping that's fairly easy to remove. The serum is in a beautifully designed bottle and is easily dispensed with a pump at the top (extra points for that I hate the upside down tube dispensers). The fluid does have a bit more scent than I care for but I'm also sensitive to stronger perfumes. It (the scent) does dissipate quickly so that wasn't a deal-breaker. The fluid goes on easily and is not at all heavy or greasy so it's easy to put makeup on right afterwards. Does it work? I've been using it for about five days now and have noticed some slight changes (the skin feels a bit tighter) but nothing overly dramatic. At a lower price it is a product that I would consider purchasing but as always YMMV. Works well but that price is a deal breaker,Neutral
I have used this conditioner all the way to the bottom of the tube.  I think you really have to give something like hair products a real work out before you can form an opinion.  Although I would not continue using anything that hurt me or smelled bad or didn't do the basics.  Age Defy definitely passed the first test!First off the price is great.  You get a lot for your bucks. Secondly the texture and smell of the conditioner is light and pleasant.  When my hair was air dried later I was not stuck with an annoying perfume which some conditioners that Pantene have made before did with me.I am  and do not color my hair.  My hair is called salt and pepper with the white hairs being very coarse wiry and flyaway.  Most of my life my hair has been easy to style and control.  The white hairs are now quite a challenge.  This product is what I needed.  My hair feels soft and is much more manageable.  This is exactly what I have been looking for and I am very happy with this well priced and excellent conditioner.  I have not experienced breakage split ends or thinning hair yet.  But it delivered on the promise of controlling frizz unruly grays lackluster color and definitely improved on dryness. Does what it says it will do,Neutral
I like Pantene products and so decided to take a chance on this hair thickening treatment and thus far I'm not disappointed.  It has made my hair thicker or at least I think so but what happens when I stop using it?My box did not come with instructions so I followed what the bottle said to do.  Perhaps I used too much product but after three days use my hair although thicker had lost its usual shine.  And one thing which I did not like at all was the scent.  I use perfume all the time and I could not distinguish between the Pantene and my Guerlain perfume which I much prefer.If my hair is thicker in six weeks than it is now I'll buy a bottle to continue the thickening process.  But if not well I'll just cough it up to nothing ventured nothing gained. It's worked thus far.....,Neutral
Results and reviews for this product will likely vary depending on hair type and length.  I have long hair which generally makes my hair look normal in thickness when I wear it down but it's not.  My sides are more thin than the back and nape of neck area.  I use this product primarily (following the directions) on my scalp on the sides (above ears) my bang area and along my defined part.  These are the areas that I feel are the more thin and limp.  The amount you need to use will depend on your hair.  I probably use - pumps on each area  - carefully parting spraying and rubbing into my scalp when hair is damp.  I love this product because it is not thick gel-like sticky or irritating. I'm the kind of customer who can't stand using those type of products.  Oh sure I have a counter full of them because I try many with hopes of it working but goo sticky or waxy just doesn't work for me.  Compared to other popular products I do not think the scent is overwhelming or clashes with perfume or cologne.  If you've used other Pantene products you can expect basically the same type of scent.  I am sensitive to many products and this does not irritate my scalp even during the dry winter months.I recommend putting on damp hair and then blow-drying for best and fullest results.  I've put on damp hair and let air dry but did not get the optimal result.  At first I wasn't sure if I was losing less hair but then I did notice my brush truly did have less strands in it less on my shoulders after blow drying and less on the bathroom carpet.Will your hair feel and look super thick?  Um...no but it will look like you're having a good hair day and you will notice less shedding hairs with use of this product.  Also it did not make my particular hair which is fine and dark look greasy at all.  I think if this occurs just cut back on the amount you're using.  I will be buying and using this product in the future. Pretty Darn Happy with Results,Neutral
With my very fine and usually limp hair I'm always searching for a thickening product to add more volume without weighing my hair down or leaving behind any residue. I've been a long time user (and fan) of Pantene shampoos and conditioners so when I heard about this new product I had to try it.The product comes out of the bottle similar to hairspray but has a light slippery gel-like consistency. I can't say I liked the alcohol and added fragrance combination. It smelled more perfume-y than clean in my opinion.Like the instructions said I parted my hair in several places and used a few sprays along each part line. With my medium-length hair I'd say I used about about  or so sprays.I rubbed it throughout my hair especially toward the root area. It says you can use it on either wet or dry hair. I used it when my hair was freshly washed and combed through.As I blew dried my hair I could tell it had more substance and volume. It did feel thicker. When my hair was totally dry it looked visibly thicker soft and had a nice shape. The only problem was that after a few hours my hair volume pretty much returned to what it looks like if I don't use any product on it. It also felt a little weighed down and 'crispy' as if I used too much hairspray. The next day I had to shampoo it twice to rinse the product out before my hair felt clean again.I've tried the spray a few more times since but I still have the same issues with the volume not lasting long enough the annoying residue feel and the somewhat overpowering scent. I was really hoping this would be the answer to thicker fuller hair but I guess I'll have to keep searching. Volume didn't last long enough,long time
This is a very creamy shampoo.  With all artificial/mainstream ingredients.  I usually prefer the more natural product lines because I'm not a fan of chemicals but I have enjoyed this shampoo.  It gives my hair a nice hang and a nice amount of body.  Not too much volume but enough to make it bouncy.  It is very heavily scented I could use a little less perfume but I've gotten used to it after a few days. For a mainstream shampoo I do recommend this brand.  And specifically this age defying shampoo. Gives My Hair  A Nice Look.,Neutral
After using the entire bottle I did find that my hair had improved in terms of overall texture and manageability.My hair has a tendency for the top layer to become frizzy and this shampoo tamed that tendency.  It was notable since that was the case even when I let it air dry.  Some of the other noted benefits of using this shampoo were less apparent to me since I do not have gray or dull hair - but it cleaned it well and left it shiny as well as manageable.The consistency is a bit different than other shampoos I'm used to - a bit more like that of some conditioners - however it lathered well and the fragrance was pleasant without overpowering.  Men or women could use this equally without feeling like they were wearing perfume.In the end it went on easily was easily rinsed and left me with clean hair that was better-behaved than before. Waited to review this until I'd used the entire bottle...,Neutral
oh my God this product is the best thing ive ever used in my hair ever! Let me just say. it also gets rid of my frizz aswell as binding together my split ends. My hair is relaxed and I press it three times a month but I have managed to grow my hair and maintain its length to my waist. The ends of my hair can be pretty ratty at times but when I use this product it looks like a fresh pack of weave LOL!Scent* it is a very perfumey scent not bad and it does fade by the next day and it dosent conflict with your leave in conditioner of choice either.texture* it is like a thick paste but it is not heavy at all and I can see this being great for all hair types as it isnt heavy and dosent leave any residue feeling on the hair.results* this isn't going to permanently fix your split ends it just seals them back together until your next wash and how that helps your hair grow is because u dont have to cut off your ends as fast because when you seal them back together the split ends dont have the ability to keep traveling up your hair shaft.how it compares to nexus* I have been using the nexus split end mender stuff for awhile and I thought it was great but this stuff beats it hands down give it a try!LOVE this stuff highly recommend everyone try it! works soooooooooooo good!,Neutral
Okay the bottle is shaped like a bust of Nicki Minaj.Did you read that?A BUST OF NICKI MINAJ!Skeptical might not be the right word. But I gave it a shot. Even after realizing my finger was between the bust's well busts I sprayed it and....Fruit and vanilla.YUM.It's not super strong it is definitely one of the girliest scents I've ever smelled but that is actually a good thing in this case. I really do like it. I tend to prefer stronger perfumes for nights out so either this is just daytime or I tend to mix it with something with a little more spice for night time- either way it does the job nicely.Again the bottle may be awkward to hold but it ends up being worth it.

It smells fruity but in a fun and non-cheap way.I think the target demographic for this scent is about teenage to mid s I am in my s and I cannot resist it. I love the smell. At first it is a bit too strong but the scent stays even if I washed my hand with water.I used a tester so I am not sure if the tester perfume was a lot stronger than the regular perfume. Still the price is super unbeatable. I can daresay this is one of the BEST celebrity fragrances. I bought lady gaga's fame as well but I got bored of it quick. Lasting scent.,Neutral

There's nothing like a South Florida sunburn.  You don't have to walk far to see people walking around with leathery hands.  They refuse to heed the warnings of our climate and skin cancer.  There should be no sunny day where you're not wearing something to protect your skin.  Even when there's overcast skies you'll still need an SPF of at least .***Banana Boat is one of the more well-known brands that we use down here along with Coppertone.The lotion has a nice smell not overly perfume-y and goes on somewhat thin.SPF of  is very necessary down here. If you're coming to Miami... bring this!,Neutral
Some thought clearly went into the package of this product - flip lid stores upside down to keep the suntan lotion coming out to the very end. Also the little hand grips should prove helpful.But...this product does have a smell. At first this smell is strong but the medicine-y smell does go away. I am not fond of the perfume-y smell that stays behind. I guess I am old school in that I like the coconut smell best. Great package stinky smell,Neutral
From the looks of the other reviews I wasn't alone.  I couldn't stand the smell of the stuff long enough to bother worrying about a sunburn.  Who wants to wear something that not only overpowers their favorite perfume but also the cologne and perfume of an entire crowd?  I don't want people downwind to be wrinkling their noses thinking that they have wandered into the laundry room!I don't like heavy sunscreens that make me feel even hotter than our Southern summers but even the aroma of sweat would be an improvement over smelling like I just got off shift in a soap factory.  The overpowering scent makes the whole package worthless in my opinion.Tone down the perfume Banana Boat!Sunscreen should be neither seen nor smelled while it's doing its job! Way too strong of a scent,favorite perfume
I used this yesterday while at tennis practice and it protected my skin just fine from the sun.  I was surprised when I first applied it because of a sudden rush of almost cold especially on my face.  I liked that quite a lot.  However there was a very slight residual burning on my face afterwards.  Not bad enough to cause me to wipe it off but I think it was probably the residual alcohol or something which stung just a teensy bit for awhile afterwards.  The cooling lasted around  or so minutes until it wore off.  But it was different and unexpected and felt good.The viscosity of this sunscreen is on the thin side not thick and gooey like some others.  It comes out of the bottle sort of fast so be ready to catch it. When I open the lid the sunscreen already comes out so no squeezing of the bottle is necessary. Smells good no strong perfume to torture me with. Banana Boat CoolZone Sunscreen SPF ,Neutral
Personally I prefer sunscreen that smells of  cocoa butter but this wasn't bad.  It has a generic sort of soapy smell that wasn't strong.  (Results may vary.  I just sat down and read what others experienced and apparently their bottles were overly perfumed.  Our sample was not.)I'm not sure I understand the benefit of the cooling.  Usually I put lotion on the kids before we go outside and little bodies are not hot at that point.  In fact little and bigger bodies object to feeling colder.  Though I will admit that when I go to re-apply the lotion and it's steamy hot that I enjoy the sensation.A nice product when it comes out of the tube it's white but soon disappears as you rub it around. I would use it except for faces where you run the risk of it mixing with sweat and water and running into the eyes.  The waxy stick sunscreens are superior in this area.Pam T~mom/fur-mom Works and It's not Greasy,Neutral
I wanted to try a sunscreen that is not in an aerosol can and thought the idea of it cooling when you put it on sounded nice.  But I don't like the scent at all - I'm sensitive to perfumes (fragrance is on the ingredients list) and it smells to me a little like rubbing alcohol.  That outweighs any cooling benefit it might have.  I wouldn't get this one again.  I preferBanana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion Spf   Ounce.On the plus side the bottle does have a recycling code (you can see it when you pull the cap off).  I am trying to buy things in packaging that can be recycled.Also if you spend time out in the sun where you can have the lotion handy -- and you don't dislike the smell as much as I do -- this probably would feel nice when you reapply. I have been putting it on before I start my long walks (- hours) and don't bring it along to reapply so the cooling feature isn't much benefit to overcome the scent. I dont like the smell,Neutral
My husband does a lot of bird watching in his spare time. Prolonged exposure to sun and wind has been drying to his skin but he's not fond of many sunscreens that are either too oily or too heavily perfumed. Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion SPF  contains aloe is absorbed very quickly into the skin and has a very light fresh scent that's appropriate for men or women. It's not overpowering in any way. The  ounce size is ideal to tuck into a backpack pocket hiking vest or (for gals) a purse. Great for Guys Too... very light scent not perfumed,Neutral
I'm fair skinned and live in southern CA about  blocks from the beach.  This sunscreen is very good!  The bottle is small enough that it's easy to carry with you. The lotion is water resistant for  minutes is not perfumed and is not greasy!  It's easy to put on and tells you to put it on  minutes before you get exposed. Clear and precise instructions are on the back of the bottle.I recommend it highly. Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion spf ,Neutral
This sunscreen has the added moisturizer benefit of aloe vera.  It's not greasy & stinky (hooray!) so I can wear this during the day when I'm out & about.  Since it has moisturizer in it there is no need to apply another product for moisturizing.It is also water resistant ( minutes) so a perfect sunscreen for the beach.  It doesn't make your skin feel like its encased in a slimy bag.  Of course the most important thing is it blocks UVA/UVB rays & keeps skin from getting sunburned.  I used this on a very sunny day at an outdoor wedding/reception & it worked great; no sunburn.  And I didn't smell like sunscreen.  And it didn't ruin the dress I was wearing with grease & sunscreen perfume. Blocks the Sun Not Greasy & No Heavy Fragrance,Neutral
This product is a great moisturizer with perfect consistency that leaves your skin silky smooth.  The bonus is that it is a broad spectrum sunblock. It's a good size and great value for the cost and for the quality of the product you receive.  It does have a light scent but it's not overwhelming and doesn't smell like perfume so would be perfect for men and women.  Definite recommend. Silky Skin After Use,Neutral
For the past couple summers I have been usingCoppertone Sport SPF  Continuous Spray Clear Twin Pack -Ounce Cansin an aerosol spray bottle because I wanted to apply the sunscreen without having to use my hands.  But I'm trying to use products that are in recyclable packaging so I wanted to try this sunscreen.First off it smells good but says it is fragrance free so it must be the scent of the ingredients.  I am very sensitive to perfumes and always appreciate products with no added perfumes.  Next it looks a little funky in the bottle with green swirls but just ignore that - it goes on white and absorbs without any green showing.It leaves my skin feeling very soft and doesn't have the sticky feeling that sunscreen often gets.  I like this product a lot.  I still prefer spraying my sunscreen but this container is recyclable (you have to pull the cap off to see the recycling code) so that outweighs my preference for spraying.Unfortunately I can't review how well it works as a sunscreen.  I have skin that tan very easily and went out in the sun for a lot of little times when I thought I didn't need sunscreen until my skin is quite tan.  However I have been using this when I am intending to be in the sun for long periods while out training for a half marathon and don't see any redness when I get back so I assume it is doing its job.One more thing if you are exercising in the sun/heat and sweating up a storm you will get a lotion/sweat slick.  I think that is the case no matter what kind of sunscreen you use. My skin feels soft and not greasy or sticky,Neutral
This sunscreen does exactly what it promises.Is very light and absorbs immediately completely non-greasy.Skin is left feeling smooth but dry.Very pleasant to wear doesn't cause sweating or oily feel on skin.Excellent moisturizer while protecting skin from sunburn.Been using this while gardening in sunny Texas heat and I'm very impressed with this product.Good value and can be used by men or women as there is no perfume smell. Very Impressed,Neutral
My normal shampoo is sulfate-free Pureology Hydrate; something I can't imagine ever leaving in preference to any other shampoo product. But...the SMELL of this Cristophe shampoo gave me a SHAMPOO EXPERIENCE! I can't even describe the pure pleasure and bliss of the amazing scent this shampoo has. It smells like something Michael Kors would design something I'd love anyway since I have a lot of his perfumes. This shampoo just for the scent makes it irresistable. Even as delectable as the fragrance is it doesn't linger in your hair very long so it won't compete with any fragrance you may wear.This lathers like a typical sulfate-containing shampoo but it doesn't strip your hair like one. I was surprised at how gentle this shampoo actually was on my hair normally I get a dry feeling but it left it soft and shiny. It didn't do much about tangles (which I often get at the ends after wearing my hair straight for a few days) and my Pureology does. The Cristophe also didn't fare very well on hair that had substantial hairstyling product buildup; it took two shampoos to get that residue out. (but it smelled so incredible I didn't mind!!)  My coarse curly hair dried into bouncy shiny corkscrews when I let it air-dry without any additives only a little bit of frizz compared to normal sulfate shampoo.The shampoo itself is orange making the bottle seem tinted orange. I only mention this because the marketing department of this product picked THE perfect color for this packaging. The bottle LOOKS like the fragrance smells. I know this is such a petty thing but a blue/green/purple bottle would not have been the same. This product felt % cohesive from packaging to fragrance to performance something that isn't often successfully done. It looked smelled and felt like a very high-end product.  The bottle is also above-average in quality I like a rocker cap on my products. It's hard for me to fight with a cap in the shower and this one opened and closed with the lightest touch of a finger. When it fell off my shower ledge it never leaked all over like many do. Top rate quality packaging.I went back to my Pureology because nothing beats that for my hair but I admit to cheating on my pepperminty shampoo every once in awhile to enjoy the wicked lather of this Christophe shampoo and the heavenly scent of it. If I could find a shower gel in this fragrance I would buy it over and over. I'd buy this shampoo as a gift for someone like it that much. Above average smells insanely good,little bit
It gives my hair good shine and body. The perfume is a very strong salon-type fragrance but I used my usual conditioner so it didn't linger.  My hair is normal in terms of oiliness. I think this would be best for dry hair. Definitely not for oily hair. A mild shampoo bright orange in color and a bit pricey but does a nice job of cleaning the hair without stripping the oils. I sometimes have dry scalp and that was not a problem with this shampoo. If the price is okay with you and your hair is normal to dry you might like this. Nice shampoo,Neutral
This item was given to me for my review.I have a problem with hairsprays...they tend to be too perfumed and/or heavy for my fine hair. Okay but....,Neutral
This hairspray works just fine in keeping my hairstyle in check but there are a few negatives that I think kind of outweigh the positives. First of all and maybe most important is that the hairspray leaves your hair with that crunchy slightly hard feeling. That's nice if no one is going to touch your hair or you don't mind having that crunchy feeling. Or if you have a particularly complicated hairstyle that requires that. But it's not really fun to run your fingers through your hair. Also the smell of the hairspray is a little strong for my taste. Hairspray isn't meant to be used as a perfume and I don't want people to smell my hair before I come into the room. Also if your hair happens to get a little wet from rain the smell is reactivated.So this hairspray works fine in holding your hair in place but I just don't see myself using any more than just this one can. Okay but...,Neutral
I have baby fine long straight hair. Giving any kind of volume to my roots is a tall order. As time has gone by I&#;m actually starting to like the results I&#;m seeing with the Christophe Professional Volumizing Spray but not without some frustrating starts.I don&#;t know if it&#;s because it was shipped in the middle of a deep freeze but when I opened this spray (which has a non-aerosol pump) it just would not depress. I tried multiple times taking the nozzle out of the bottle each time. I would finally get it to release the volumizer making a mess of my bathroom counter and mirror only to put it back into the bottle to have the same problem all over again. This went on about four times and then just when I was ready to give up it started working correctly.I&#;m glad it did because I&#;m definitely noticing some body as a result of this product.How I use it: . I let my hair air dry while I&#;m brushing my teeth putting on jewelry and applying makeup. . Next I section my hair spraying the Cristophe tonic directly to my scalp. . Then using the volumizing attachment on my hair dryer I dry with my head flipped over concentrating the diffuser at the roots. When I flip back over I see results that typically only happen with a professional blowout.And speaking of professional this product smells like it comes from a high-end salon too. It&#;s a pleasant subtle smell though not an overpowering perfumey one. The heat from my hair dryer brings it out but I don&#;t go around gagging on it the rest of the day.I&#;ve been using Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection AgeDefy Advanced Thickening Treatment (http://www.amazon.com/Pantene-Collection-Advanced-Thickening-Treatment/dp/BJUTC/ref=sr__?ie=UTF&qid;=&sr;=-&keywords;=pantene+pro-v) which I was quite happy with but I think I like this volumizing spray tonic even better at least equally. And it&#;s slightly less expensive. Growing on Me After a Frustrating Start,Neutral
Hair stuff isn't high drama but not everything does exactly what it is supposed to do.This does make your hair shiny and soft.It does not have a scent or at least not much of one if there is.  So there are no issues with conflicting scents between your perfume and this serum.It worked well on a toddler's long hair as well as adult hair.  As a bonus it also removed a mysterious very sticky substance from hair (No idea what it was but the serum got rid of it.)This isn't magic but it did consistently deliver soft shiny hair that felt and looked healthy.  It works great on long and shoulder length hair and it seems more manageable. Just a little bit does the jo,little bit
My hair is fine and frizzy.  I don&#;t even like to brush it because that just makes it more frizzy and puffy (not the good kind of puffy).  So I&#;m always on the lookout for a product that will get rid of the frizz but not leave my hair flat on my head.  This worked wonders on my hair.  You only need a small amount even with hair down to the middle of the back like mine is it only took less than a quarter size to notice a difference.  The frizz was nearly gone and I wasn't afraid to brush my hair!  Also there is really no scent to the product that I could detect.  Which is nice since the scent of some hair products can overwhelm your perfume. Banish Frizzy Hair,Neutral
This is my first try with BB cream of any kind. The cream is very thick and rich almost like a mousse. It is also fragrant so if you are sensitive to perfumes this is not for you.  The coverage is good although I had to use foundation over it. The tint wasn't enough to cover even my light skin. I could use this perhaps in the summer when I want more of a sheer look. I didn't note a great difference in moisture from my day cream or foundation. Lush,Neutral
My skin is normal to oily with dryness around my nose.  I rarely breakout.  My usual skin routine is to use something to even out the redness around my nose and to cut the shine on my forehead and nose.  I actually do have a go-to BB cream (Missha) which can even out redness and stop shine.  But I decided to test out this Olay BB cream alone to see if it might live up to its own packaging hype.Bottom line: no this did not work for me.I have NC-NC skin tone.  The Olay BB cream fair to light seemed a good match.  It is...err...skin colored.  sorry!  I mean it is neither too pink too orange or too gray.  It is a thin consistency that seems to get on everything you touch so I applied using a damp sponge.  Using this technique it actually gave OK coverage to even out the redness around my nose.  At first it even seemed to mattify my forehead.  It felt light but within hours (before noon) my face looked greasy and it even appeared i was a shade darker than usual!  I can't stand moisturizers that feel heavy.This BB cream is also heavily perfumed.  My eyes were tearing as I applied it and i had to redo my mascara.This was no good for me.  However in fairness this may be the right cream for someone else.  I'd suggest trying to obtain a small sample first before you buy the entire product.  But keep in mind there are much better choices out there. Heavily perfumed not high performance,Neutral
I liked how smooth this made my skin feel and it definitely wasn't oily and didn't cause any negative reactions (so  stars for sensitive skin customers) but there really was some kind of scent to this that made it impossible for me to wear. It wasn't perfumey which was a plus but it sort of had a smell like the only thing I can compare it to is ashes. I really wanted to like this and maybe I just got a bad jar. The cream itself worked really well. Not exactly fragrance-free,sensitive skin
I have very dry extremely sensitive skin and I'm allergic to synthetic fragrances. This face cream is a homerun as far I'm concerned. It has very little smell and no perfume smell at all. Hydrates the skin VERY well for all night hydration and does not become greasy. The skin really soaks all of this up. As for the age-defying properties my skin did feel a bit plumper and tighter after several nights of continuous use and I've not experienced those results with other face creams for sensitive skin so I'm very happy with the results. Works great no perfume smell and not greasy at all.,sensitive skin
I was really looking forward to using this product.  I had been usingOlay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion . Fl Ozat night for a short while with great results but it had a perfume type scent.  This sensitive skin night cream is fragrance free.  It also looks like theOlay Professional Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream . Ouncethat I use to use.  It's a light looking cream.  But strangely it felt anything but light on my face.  My skin did not absorb it well.  It felt like I had a heavy lotion on my face.  I can't stand that feeling.  Also the days after using this night cream my skin looked dull and dry.  I went back to the Fresh Effects moisturizer. Too Heavy . . . .,sensitive skin
I love olay products.  And I liked this one as well.  The one thing I noticed is that it wasn't filled with perfumes which is great because I hate stinky creams. I used this cream during the night and day(there is no sun in Upstate NY these days) and it got rid of my dry skin. I was very pleased with that. I had used a few other creams but it wasn't working very well.  And I had a spot on my cheek and forehead that wouldn't go away but after two days it was gone. YAY!The cream was smooth when it went on and I didn't feel any tingling or tightening of the skin. My skin did not have any altergic reations to the cream.While it worked great on my dry skin I didn't see huge improvements on the fine lines on my face. So while I like the product and would buy it I wouldn't buy it to take care of my wrinkles. It works well but age defying?,dry skin
I have yet to use a product made by Oil of Olay that doesn't do what it is supposed to do.  This spot fading treatment is no different.I used it on some dark spots on my face and I could tell the difference even after one use.  After three uses the spot was almost completely gone.  The creamy lotion goes on easily and absorbs into the skin well.I couldn't detect any scent with the product which is great as it doesn't fight' with my perfume.  If you have dark spots you would like to fade without surgery try Olay Spot Fading Treatment. Oil of Olay is the best!,Neutral
I used this product on a dark spot on my face and it did what it promised: the spot became noticeably lighter in color. The liquid isthe consistency of water and is completely odorless an advantage for me as I dislike skin products with scents so strong they compete with your perfume. The product didn't irritate my skin at all and was easy to use -- just dispense a drop onto your hand then apply it to the spot. I especially like this method of application as there is no contamination of the product and it stays fresh. Works Well,Neutral
Like other reviewers here I've used Oil of Olay off and on for years (I like Neutrogena as well). I have seen some comments here about the strong perfume in this product which surprises me because I've very sensitive to perfumes yet had no reaction to this product at all. I didn't have any redness or other irritations I've had with some moisturizers.I do like the packaging I prefer pump dispensers and the circumference of the bottle is wide enough it doesn't topple over (a plus). The moisturizer is nice and thick (another plus I hate runny) but doesn't have a greasy feel to it. I don't wear heavy makeup only a bit of foundation and didn't have any problems putting that on right afterwards. As for how it works? I've had it for about a week now. I haven't noticed any huge difference but even at my advanced age I'm fortunate not to have heavy wrinkles. As for the sunscreen? SPF  is a bit on the low side of things but it is January in Seattle and I've not had the opportunity to give it a test drive. Won't see much sun for a few months now.A big thanks to the folks at Amazon Vine and Olay for the chance to test drive this product. No complaints,Neutral
Most of the time I love love love Olay moisturizers.  They work really well and have little or no scent.  Unfortunately this one is an exception to the scent rule.  The scent of this one is so strong it could double as a perfume.  And it is not like a citrus scent which I can usually tolerate.  This is a flowery scent that does not dissipate at all after you put it on . . . even in the rain. Within a hour of wearing it I stared having sinus problems.Also  although it does not state on the box it can be worn under foundation I assumed it could since this has a sunscreen and is not described as a night moisturizer.  But that was disastrous too.  I useCoverGirl Smoothers Aquasmooth Compact Foundation Natural Beige   .-Ounce which has a nice matte finish.  On top of this moisturizer however the finished look was definitely more caked.  I just washed everything off after two hours.  I'm truly sorry I can't use this product since it promises so much and Olay products usually deliver what they promise. A Moisturizer That Doubles As A Perfume . . . .,Neutral
First please understand that this is not Pantene and does not have any artificial perfumes. So it smells like what's in it: Castor oil pimento etc. It has a very strong smell that some dislike. I did not like it at first but I am now quite used to it and rather like it.While these products are usually touted for naturally curly hair I see no reason why it shouldn't work for a variety of different hair types. I find that the shampoo is cleansing without stripping my hair and creating fly-aways. The conditioner is awesome and leaves my curls springy and moisturized. The leave-in is great to use after I wash my hair but it is also great for sparing every day use.As far as I can tell this trio helps to keep hair moisturized; many find that castor oil helps hair to grow and thicken. Great stuff!,Neutral
I usually like the Hemp Body Butter from The Body Shop but was shopping at TJ's and found this while looking for a birthday gift for my daughter. I decided to get one for myself and one for her.This smells like natural coconut without a perfume'y scent which is important to me. I insist on mostly natural products for skin lotions as I feel it's important to our health.  The skin is our largest organ and soaks up whatever we put on it.If you live near a Trader Joe's you can buy this for about half the price there.This absorbs well without leaving a greasy residue. I did notice a little grit but I'm sure it's from the natural ingredients and it just sloughs off easily.The flip up lid is handy - no need to screw it on or off.It's winter now and this just reminds me of summertime while hydrating nicely.If you are looking for a great body or hand lotion in a pump bottle I highly recommend Avalon Organics esp. the Lavender. Smells Great and Soaks In Well,Neutral
This color is great! Its a perfect kind of brown/mauve without being too dark. The one complaint I have is the weird perfume smell but the color is worth it. An amazing color,Neutral
Man where to begin. I bought this for myself. It arrived and I put it on it smells so delicious and sexy. The problem is it is gone in less than an hour. Not even a trace. I don't even attempt to wear this outside of the house because it has no staying power. It's a shame because like I said it is fantastic. I even tried layering it nope that didn't work either. I buy it though because I wear it for myself around the house. I'm thankful it is priced so well because I go through a bottle a month. They really need to make this in a pure perfume but this as it is doesn't have much alcohol in it so I don't know why it doesn't last for very long and I see I'm not the only one. Love it but it sucks but I still buy it for me.,Neutral
I love the smell of this perfume! It smells almost like honey amber or something when you first spray it then it smells sort of fruity as time goes on. I would say overall it's a warm sweet scent. spray at least - inches away from clothing though because it is black liquid. will definitely be buying more when I run out! fame perfume,Neutral
Very unique like I've stated in the title. It has a honey undertone to it which I LOVE but also has an almost incense-like undertone that makes it more mature and womanly than girly. It works wonderfully for casual situations even with a hoodie and jeans as I've learned! (I'm a collage student. All collage students have those 'not wearing real clothes today' days haha!) I love this perfume! Though it does need reapplied halfway through the day. Still a wonderful scent though. Unique,Neutral
I actually received a sample of this perfume from a different store and I loved it so had to purchased the big bottle and I absolutely love love love it and it's smells great. Smells Good,Neutral
I love this perfume the smell is amazing! My husband is the one who originally picked it out and he loves it too! Smells great!,Neutral
While I love Lady Gaga's music I am still hesitant to buy any perfume that carries a celebrity's name... mainly because they're celebrities.  This perfume is perfection though! It has a sweet and light flowery scent without being cloying or overpowering. The incense that comes through it just wonderful and not too heavy.  I know it sounds silly but this scent reminds me of Daenerys from Game of Thrones.  GRRM describes the different flower oils she wears and the incense can't help but remind me of the fire from her Dothraki tents... AND DRAGONS!  If you can't tell I am highly in love with it.  My only complaint is that it doesn't linger as long as I want it to but I also haven't tried the Eau de Parfum only the Eau de Toilet/Perfume which is a weaker strength.  It's nice though for it to be such a light scent because it isn't overpowering so I don't imagine people who are sensitive to perfume would be greatly affected if at all. Don't let its maker fool you!,Neutral
Its for a Christmas gift looks like a $ perfume. Everyone says its a nice scent so I'm very very pleased!Came fast well packaged and in one piece.I wish I could keep it. The bottle is beeeautiful!!!!!!! Very impressive!,Neutral
I love this perfume. It is a light scent but powerful enough to smell. I found it on here way cheaper than any store! Love it!,Neutral
If you like lavender you will love the smell of this women's perfume. Try it you will like it. You won't be disappointed. THe Best,Neutral
My favorite body oil!  I use this after getting out of the shower and it moisturizes better than any body cream lotion or other body oils.  The fragrance is soft light clean and pleasant--won't clash with perfumes. I will not let my household be without this body oil :- My favorite body oil,Neutral
The Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer is a spray based system that aims at giving consumers a fast and easy way to moisturize.  I wasn't aware that the old fashioned products were so inconvenient but my wife assures me that they in fact are!  This product goes on easily much like a spray on sun screen does and then has to be gently rubbed into the skin.  It leaves skin feeling softer and only leaves behind the faintest traces of a greasy or oily feeling.One thing to consider is that this moisturizer has a scent which seems to linger for a long time and as such women who wear any perfume on top of it might not like the way the combination smells.  The scent itself is pleasant but if you're looking for something that doesn't have a lingering scent you'll want to look elsewhere.I'd give this one a try rating especially if you're in a cold and dry climate like we are now here in Chicago.  It's easy to apply and seems to do the job of moisturizing quite well. My Wife's New Favorite Moisturizer,long time
This seems to moisturizer well and has a nice smell.  I wish it had no odor at all though.  If you wear perfume a scented deodorant scented shampoo or soap etc.  All the smells compete with one another.  Yuck.  If your only fragrance comes from this it should be fine. Nice smell seems good,Neutral
I have started to use this a month ago and I'm addicted to it now! It is part of my morning and evening routine because this is so much easier to use than ordinary lotion is. It takes me about  seconds to spray it all over and another minute to rub it in. It doesn't get any easier than that! The smell is great feminine not overpowering at all. You can still use perfume on top of it without feeling like you have overdone it. It feels very nice and non-greasy on the skin. I recommend it! I love it! Perfect in place of a daily lotion!,Neutral
~Just like its name this moisturizer is simple and light. It is perfect to apply at night for a slight cover of moisture to my sensitive skin. It absorbed quickly with absolutely no thick oily feel however my skin didn't feel any less dry after a few minutes. There are no perfumes or dyes which is a plus. With all that said I'd say this protecting light moisturizer is...okay.  I still opt for my usual moisturizer under my make-up; I guess I need a little more moisturizing in my moisturizer. Simple and Light Moisturizer,sensitive skin
This moisturizer is light and effective. My face tends to be dry and it worked all day without needing to reapply it. The bottle notes that there are no added perfumes but it does have a light scent that I don't like. The smell doesn't prevent me from using the product however. Overall a good moisturizer. Nice moisturizer but I don't like the smell,Neutral
This product is to me an upgrade of the Simple Replenishing Skin Moisturizer that came out last year.  I reviewed that product and really liked it - but my one complaint was that is lacked spf protection.  This light moisturizer remedies that one defect.Overall I found this to be a good moisturizer. As someone who has very sensitive dry skin including a number of skin conditions (my wife jokes that I'm a dermatologist's dream) I'm always cautious about new products. For example I'm now allergic to most laundry detergents and deodorant products. Anyway I was gratified to read that there are no perfumes or colors added to this product.I've found that the moisturizer works very well on my face - no dryness redness or peeling which distinguishes it from plenty of other moisturizers. It also lasts well over  hours. And certainly no allergic reaction which is great. The moisturizer also soaks in well - I don't feel oily or greasy.For the money though this is a good moisturizer and I'll keep using it Good stuff,dry skin
First off this is NOT a moisturizer for dry or very dry skin types. For oil or combination skin it may be just perfect. I liked the feel of it since it's nearly undetectable but it may be just too light for mature skin or skin that's dehydrated- or your climate is dry. It leaves virtually NO feeling of moisturizer on the skin AT ALL. That was almost perfect for me since I enjoy wearing moisturizing foundation and most creams or lotions with SPF are just too heavy and feel like a mask. My make-up doesn't slide with this product or cake.Pros:* Light almost invisible texture; great for oily/combination skin or those who hate the feeling of moisturizer.* Unscented except for the sunscreen ingredients which have a subtle scent similar to tanning lotion* Inexpensive* Contains Pro vitamin B & vitamin E. While I could find the vitamin E on the ingredient list the B was strangely missing. I'm not sure how much either of these vitamins would do for the skin in very small quantities.* It has SPF * No dyes or perfumesCons:* Heck of alot of chemicals in there (which might account for the inexpensive price tag). This product most certainly would NOT appeal to those who prefer an organic or natural moisturizer.* Some of the ingredients ARE sensitizing for certain individuals. I would think twice about recommending this to those I know with reactionary skin. I took some time to check out the ingredients online and was concerned. My  nieces with sensitive skin most likely could NOT use this product. Almost perfect....,dry skin
I really wanted to like this moisturizer because it has no added perfume and it is supposed to be okay for sensitive skin. Unfortunately it smells like a sunscreen product which is tolerable if you are going to the beach but otherwise not desirable. I only used it a few times before stopping because of the odor.I looked up many of the ingredients on the EWG Cosmetic Database. This product fares pretty well compared to many. However there are some ingredients that raise a red flag particularly ensulizole which is known to produce free radicals when exposed to sunlight leading to damage of DNA. Also both Tocopheryl Acetate and Methylisothiazolinone are known to cause allergic reactions in some people.I did not suffer any allergic reactions but I do not plan to use this product again. Smells like Sunscreen,sensitive skin
Skincare products can be confusing. Many moisturizers are adding sunscreen; the addition of sunscreen protects your skin but with some products like this Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer the line between moisturizer and sunscreen begins to blur.This is a light oil-free moisturizer with sunscreen that is supposed to have no harsh irritants but if sunscreen is irritating to your skin then this may bother you it did me.For me personally I didn't like it. It has the same active ingredients of a traditional sunscreen so even though the Simple line has no artificial perfumes it smelled like sunscreen which I hate that scent.It also and more importantly for me was not moisturizing and I had to apply a different moisturizer after using this. It also stung my face a little because of the sunscreen.If you mainly want a sunscreen then you may appreciate this product but if you are seeking a moisturizer then you may be disappointed. I will definitely be using as a sunscreen and not as a moisturizer. Glorified Sunscreen,Neutral
This stuff is pretty nice!  I always love items that are a two in one.  This stuff is nice since it is a moisturizer and a sunscreen!  This stuff rubs on nice (a little goes a long way) and rubs into the skin where you can touch your skin and not feel it (no oily or sticky feeling like some products).  However you can feel your skin is different compared to the parts that do not have this on (it feels hydrated).  It goes on clean and does not leave any residue or grease!  It is a pretty low SPF so this is not a great choice for the beach but for general outside tasks (gardening and being outside in the city) it is a great way to protect the skin and keep it moisturized.  My only complaint with this (not a big deal) is that it does not have any perfumes or odor added so you smell like your going to the beach (that sunscreen lotion smell that I associate with going to the beach).  It is not overpowering but you can smell it (you can cover it with some deodorant spray).In the end this is a nice moisturizer that offers a deep hydrated feeling without leaving the skin greasy or wet feeling.  I have normal skin [not tough but not sensitive to anything] and have no problem with this stuff.  It goes on clean and serves a dual purpose of keeping my skin safe from the sun in general outside work and travel.  My only problem is the smell I wish they added some perfume or something to cover the sunscreen smell now I smell like I am going to the beach however you can easily mask it yourself (I just wanted to let you know). Goes on easily and does not leave that wet or oily feeling,long way
Although it may sound cliche this product has everything you need and nothing you don't. I normally use Olay Complete because it's such a great moisturizer but sometimes it does make my face feel a little irritated. This product has the same sunscreen ingredients as Olay so it gives your face the same protection. It just doesn't irritate. It has lots of moisturizers too so it will make your face feel really soft.I really loved the fragrance of this moisturizer too. It contains vitamins and the ingredients are really good for your face. The fragrance is natural so it won't be irritating. There are no artificial perfumes or dyes so you don't have to worry about this irritant either.I will definitely use this moisturizer again because it makes my face feel really good and the ingredients don't make it itch.  Very pleasing overall. Nice Gentle Moisturizer That Protects,Neutral

I can feel them tingling a bit and then that weird slight tiny bit of sting that's barely perceptible but I know is there and I know my face will be pissed off later by either turning red or by popping up a big ugly arse pimple. DANG IT! Some products aren't barely perceptible at all but instead as soon as I apply the cream/lotion I know it must come off! My skin rejects it immediately being the b*tch it sometimes is. Dang it all.However so far so good with Simple SPF ! No stinging perceptible or otherwise; no breakouts; no GET THIS OFF MY FACE NOW AUUUGH! It goes on light and smooth and my face doesn't even know I've hit it with a sunscreen - WHUPOW! Take that face! I sometimes will apply a light moisturizer under it but it isn't necessary.It can go on thick if you use too much but it does quickly disappear so you don't have to worry about that weird white residue.I'm becoming more and  more impressed with Simple products - and they aren't expensive. Our wallets can use a break can't they? I mean don't you agree it's time they make good products that do what they say they will and work well but don't make our wallet cry for mercy? Yeah.I'll be buying more Simple products including this one when it's empty. I am crushing on some Simple products!,little bit
Love that this moisturizer is fragrance free.  It is light oil-free and has spf  protection.  It doesn't leave you looking chalky or grey. It is also infused with some good stuff.  It contains pro-vitamin B and Vitamin E.  This is the first product from the Simple line that I have tried but based on this item I plan on trying more.  I am trying to use more products that are more natural and contain less chemicals.  This has no artificial perfumes or dyes and is recommended for sensative skin. Of course if you need a heavier moisturizer for drier skin or a higher SPF this is not the choice for you.  Worked great under my makeup and doesn't leave skin oily if you have oily or combination skin. Great light moisturizer works under makeup,Neutral
I have sensitive skin and I require a moisturizer that is fragrance free because any smell coming from a creme will make my eyes water and my skin itch. This moisturizer states that itnever uses artificial perfume dyes or harsh irritants than can upset your skin.It does not specifically say that it is *fragrance free* but I thought I might like to try it anyway. For me the smell of SPF  is very strong and it doesn't dissipate after a few hours. This product also leaves a tingly feeling on my skin which is unwanted. This is not a creme which I will be able to use on my sensitive skin.It does absorb nicely as it is oil free and it does stay put. It's not really fragrance free.....,sensitive skin
The moisturizing works fine and it is nice to have some sun protection for when you go out - but I need fragrance free products. Although it says that they don't use artificial perfumes... this isn't fragrance free. Not fragrance free,Neutral
Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer is really an SPF  sunscreen with moisturizers.  I was expecting something more like an Olay facial moisturizer but this is quite similar to the No-Ad Sunblock Lotion just not as thick.It is very good for everyday use on the ears and nose  to protect from incidental sun exposure.  There is no perfume so it has a relatively neutral odor.  It absorbs well and leaves that silky feeling to the skin.Sunscreen always makes my eyes burn and the warning label on the package does state keep out of eyes rinse with water to remove so don't apply it close to the eyes and wash it off the hands after use. More of a light sunscreen with moisturizing ingredients,Neutral
I received this Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer with SPF  from BzzAgent for free to try and I have to say this has become my holy grail daytime moisturizer for my skin type. It's very light weight it good for sun protection absorbs into my skin quickly doesn't have any fragrance it's oil-free doesn't make my skin breakout or clog my pores. I have combination/oily skin but at the same time my skin is sensitive to new products especially any with perfumes or fragrance in them so when I first tried this moisturizer I was very amazed of how fast it absorbed into my skin and how it didn't feel greasy or make my skin shiny or made it  reproduced more oil throughout the day. I feel like this moisturizer even helped mattify my skin in the T-Zone area where it tends to get the most oiliest. I would recommend this moisturizer for ALL skin types even dry skin types because it does provide moisture and it balances out your skin while aiding in sun protection. It has a very light SPF  so if you like higher Sun protection in your day cream then this is not for you. Simple Moisture for My Combination Skin!,Neutral
Everyone should use facial moisturizer and this one has the added benefits of spf . True to the Simple brand it has no artificial perfumes or dyes.Perfect for my sensitive skin because my face wash tends to dry my skin out. Having a facial moistuizer that feels light and clean without leaving my skin feeling greasy is a blessing.Way to go Simple you've done it again! Everyone should,dry skin
Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer with SPF  left my skin feeling hydrated without feeling greasy or smelling of an artificial perfume. Its silky texture and uncanny ability to minimize the appearance of breakouts under my skin's surface is something I have never experienced before--I am trading in my previous moisturizer for good! Thank you Simple! (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.) 'Tis a Gift to use Simple!,Neutral
I really liked this moisturizer. It goes on light and moisturizes my skin without leaving a greasy feeling behind. In addition unlike many other moisturizers with sunscreen protection it doesn't sting my eyes when I workout or go for a run. Ideally it would contain a higher SPF-  currently it has an SPF of  - but overall it's a great product.  For those of you with sensitive skin you will be happy to know that it doesn't contain artificial perfumes and dyes. Wonderful Lightweight Moisturizer,great product
This is an excellent moisturizer and sunscreen all in one. It is a broad spectrum SPF  sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection. The instructions say to put it on  minutes before going out in the sun but I also wear it under my foundation and there is no oil buildup later in the day! It has  vitamins  sunscreen ingredients and  artificial perfumes or dyes. The two other major ingredients are water and glycerin. It is oil free and made especially for sensitive skin.  It is dermatologist tested non-comedogenic hypoallergenic and there are no animal derived ingredients. This product is made especially for the face and neck.  It comes in a plastic bottle with an easy open pop top so that with one squeeze there is a steady stream of cream. The product has a very light smell that is fresh and reminds me of a very very light citrus scent - very pleasant. Not oily and great protection,Neutral
For those saying it smells like alcohol at first and isn't what I smelled at Macys well what you smelled at Macys was an eau de parfume this is an eau de toilette. That means this contains more alcohol and less fragrance. Think body spray or spash vs perfume. If you don't like an overpowering amount of scent that might be better for you or if you want the scent but for cheaper. Companies very often put out both toilette and parfume. Great price,Neutral
My all time fav perfume is Viva La Juicy this is just as good!! I am so happy with this & I smell so good! If you like the original Viva then you will like this! I smell sooooo good!!!,Neutral
I like this fragrance more than the other Juicy perfumes I've tried. This fragrance still has some fruity undertones but the base is much more floral. I wish it lasted longer though. Best Juicy scent out there,Neutral
The jar that I receive contained darker shades of the shea butter mixed with a normal light yellow shade. I hope it's not mole. While the shea butter does a good job in moisturizing my skin it's hard and time-consuming to apply on skin. It has a light strange smell to it but it's better that they don't add perfume in it. A bit hard to use,Neutral
I really really like the Dove Men Care line of body wash products.As someone who routinely picks up Axe products or the occasional Suave at the Family Dollar store the Dove Men's Care comes as a delightful surprise.It's not as thick as their normal lotion body wash-- more like the consistency of Axe but without the excessive perfume content.In a few of these products there's actually a fine texture to it.  So as you're rubbing it on you can feel these grains actually opening up your pores.***For a couple of dollars more than Axe this is definitely a much better product.  (And the masculine scent last a couple of hours.) Another Good Product.,Neutral
Dove's Clean Defense body wash has a bit more fragrance than I like every day. It kind of reminds me of France the French love liquid soaps with a lot of perfume.This liquid soap didn't win me over completely; it has a bit too much smell. This Dove soap makes a pretty good lather a lot like my trusty bars of soap. I'm a bar soap guy. I just like a nice big bar of soap and a soft wash cloth for clean up time. This body wash stuff ah just don't like it. I hate hotels that don't have a bar of soap and make me use that liquid stuff. There is something in this soap that tingles on my face like a good cleaning. The soap rinses off nicely without leaving a residue.The container is just weird and has taken me a long time to get used to the whole upside down flip cap close it back up and set it down upside down. I can't figure out why Dove made the top pointy so I can't set it down cap up. At first it seemed like there was no way to control the amount of soap. Turns out the soap doesn't dribble out by itself but you have to squeeze it out.Even though the soap smell is strong it does remind me of France. Every once in a while it is exciting to think of France in the shower. Too Much Smell,long time
My husband has tried a number of body washes axe Irish spring and suave are his favorites.  I had him try dove men care soap one time and he loved the feeling of the soap and this fine little beads that made his skin smoother.  This body wash has those little micro beads that slough off some dead skin.  I love how his skin feels after he uses this.  He works outside all day and he is pretty dirty calloused and rough.  He cleans up nice with dove's men care.  I think that the smell is not as powerful as axe it definitely smells good and clean and and cuddle worthy.  I have used some in a pinch when I ran out of my own dove.  It is not as thick of a lotion as dove normally makes but it also doesn't dry out your skin like some overly perfumed body washes. Like the micro texture,dry skin
I am comparing both the Clean Defense and Fresh Awake body and washes by Dove.  I have tried both so I figured it would be good to compare them.Winter really dries my skin out so I was interested to see if both would help with that problem. Both seem to help a bit and I like the smell and feel of both products.They both look sort of like shave gels I have used.  They both feel nice on the skin.Clean Defense has less of powerful scent. I have used this at night when I want to shower before bed.  It seems to fight dry skin and oil build up well. It feels great on my skin. When I am finished with my shower I notice even less of a scent than with Fresh Awake.Fresh Awake has  more of a manly scent than a perfume scent. It is more energizing than calming. It is something I would associate with use in the morning rather than before going to bed. I did not notice much of a scent after I was done showering.Both seem to help with my dryness though Clean Defense seems to work a bit better. I have tried each for about two weeks. Both are fine products. Both Clean Defense and Fresh Awake Body and Face Wash Work Well,dry skin
My husband really liked the Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash saying it lathered up quickly and the lather held up for a long time.  As he uses the lather on his face to shave while he showers the fact that it holds up is a real selling point for him. The clean fresh scent is another great part of this product.  It's not overpowering or too perfumey but has just a hint of citrus. The design of the bottle with the cap on the base saves all that shaking and frustration of getting the body wash out when the product is runnig low. All and all it is a great body and face wash for any man or the entire family. Great body wash wonderful scent,long time
It's rather hard to say whether or not this actually prevents wrinkles as my face isn't too bad and I think it would require usage over a long period of time to tell that but as far as being a foundation it's perfect. It goes on as a liquid and is easy to spread evenly. It dries as a powder and the color is such...it's just enough. It blends with your natural tone. There isn't a line on your chin or your neck where the foundation stops and plain skin starts.Most notable of all...it smells really nice. This shocked me. Normally foundations and powders have no smell at all. This smells like a lotion or a perfume. It also nourishes. As for being a sunscreen I don't doubt it.If I compare this to Avon's face perfector this one wins hands down. Seems to do what it promises,Neutral
I really hate my under eye area -- the wrinkles bags and dark circles betray my true age and make me look older than I feel.  I wanted to have a good comparison on how this worked so I only used it on one eye.There is some ingredient that plumps up the under eye area fairly quickly so there was a noticeable difference between my eyes within a few days.  If I don't use it over the weekend the difference isn't as obvious but there is still a difference after two weeks of use.At this point it isn't miraculous -- I don't have the under eyes of a -year old (or even  or ) but the eye I used this on has fewer and shallower wrinkles and that is a nice improvement.  I also use it on the eyelid on that side but don't really see any difference there.  But the difference between the eye I use it on and the other eye is enough to convinced me to start using it on both eyes.  I don't like seeing how bad the other eye looks.I am wildly sensitive to fragrances in skin care products so was pleased when I opened it and didn't smell perfumes.  There is a very mild smell to it but I assume that is the smell of the ingredients because there is no fragrance/perfume on the ingredient list. I can use this without having any problems.I wear extended wear contacts and have had no problems with this getting in my eyes and no stinging.The jar is the same size and shape and in complementary colors to theHydroxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream  oz.but different enough that you won't grab the wrong one.My budget does not really extend to more than drugstore line skin care but if I can't find something less expensive that works as well on my under eye area I would buy this product when this jar is gone.  I like the improvement in my under eye area after just two weeks of use and won't want to give that up. My eyes look better -- and no perfumes,Neutral
I have a strong perfume sensitivity so am always a little leery of trying new beauty lotions and creams because manufacturers often want to make them smell pretty by adding fragrance.  My mom likes to give me moisturizer as gifts (I think she's hinting) and some of her gifts have been unusable due to the perfumes.This cream has a mild smell but perfume/fragrance is not on the list of ingredients so I assume it is from the ingredients themselves.  In any case I can put this on my skin without choking up so that was the first nice thing.The cream has a nice feel and isn't greasy on the skin.  I really hate my skin to feel greasy from a moisturizer.  Originally I was using this along withOlay Regenerist Thermal Mini-Peel Skin Care . Fl Oz(which my mom gave me this Christmas).  I realized that was too much when my friends asked me why my face was so red.  I naturally have a lot of red in my skin but I looked like I'd been in the sun and this is winter in Minnesota so I dropped the Olay Mini-Peel to once a week.I don't have the fine lines on my skin that would provide noticeable  improvement -- the expression lines on my forehead would probably require botox or fillers to erase.  However after using this for several weeks my skin feels really soft and smooth.From a shallow appearance perspective the jar is really pretty. It's like a shiny metallic blue.I was surprised that no product sheet or instructions (other than Apply every PM to clean skin avoiding the eye area in impossibly small type on the bottom of the jar).  At this price point I was expecting a little more.The box suggests using this product with the complete line of Hydroxatone skin care but the only other product from this line I am using isHydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment.  I useOlay Complete All Day Moisturizer With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf - Sensitive . Fl Oz (Pack of )during the day and a basic no-frills cleanser.With the current state of my budget I probably would not buy this with my own money.  I think it is a fine product but it's outside my price range.  However if you can afford it -- and especially if you are someone like me who can't use perfumed products -- this is a nice product and makes my skin feel really soft and smooth. No perfumes!,Neutral
This is the ideal formula for outdoorsmen who need facial protection.  The pump-action cream absorbs quickly into the skin.  It has no annoying perfumes and leaves no greasy layer.  The container is small enough for the work bag.  A small tap inserts into the hole to prevent accidental leakage of any contents. Gentle and smooth,Neutral
I got this for my husband - his comments are : &#;Other lotions that I've used either leave my skin feeling hot or oily.  This goes on very smooth and leaves a soft smooth feeling.  There is a light pleasant smell - but it's not perfumey - which is good.  It seems to last all day - at night my skin still feels moisturized and smooth.&#; Clean Cool Feeling,Neutral
Do men really put lotions on their faces? I mean other than sun block I never see any guys put lotions on their faces. I know I don't. There may be guys out there that have extremely fry skin and would benefit from lotions but faces are usually pretty oily places and don't need any extra moisture on them. Marketing face lotions to men seems like a risky proposition to me and isn't anything I'd be voting in favor of if I was in charge of launching new products.I received a sample bottle of this lotion which I have been using on the portions of my body that actually need moisturizing - my hands knees and elbows. Being a hard-working tradesman these are the parts of my body that get the most wear and tear and get overly dry. This lotion works as well as well as most other lotions I have used in the past though previous lotions I have used don't have fragrance in them. Honestly the added fragrance doesn't float my boat and I would prefer it to not have any scent. I probably still prefer moisturizing lotion products from companies such as Neutrogena Jergens Lubriderm or Eucerin.Another thing you have to realize is that with this Dove product you're getting a very miniscule amount. Most moisturizing lotion bottle have several ounces of lotion in them while this one has less than two. You're almost paying fragrance prices for this lotion which is running you over $. per ounce. That's a pretty steep price to pay. High enough so that I wouldn't recommend this product to my friends. Buy moisturizing lotion for the price of perfume!,Neutral
This Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion is a light moisturizer. I have fairly dry skin and once it absorbed into my skin my face felt dry again. This would be a good product for someone with normal to oily skin since it isn't heavy or greasy. Someone with dry skin might like this product betterDove Men+Care Hydrate + Post Shave Balmsince  it does a better job of moisturizing.  It absorbs quickly and has a nice herbal fragrance to it which is fairly pronounced. It's definitely a man's scent so it's my husband who will be using this product.  I like the scent a lot. I also like that it has a SPF  sunscreen in it since I'm not sure my husband always remembers to apply sunscreen when he goes outside.It's nice to see products like this in scents for men especially the ones with sunscreen. My husband has used hand lotions that weren't too perfumey in the past for his face. Now he has some products that are geared toward males with more appropriate scents that are meant to be used on his face. Light moisturizer with a nice fragrance,dry skin
Dove makes both a Hydrate and Sensitive + in this line of products. I can't do separate reviews for both so I am combining them.The Sensitive + has no smell. It seems to really be geared toward sensitive skin. It feels great and is quickly absorbed. It lasts for a while and is great to use after shaving and when I have been out in the sun for a while.The lack of a scent is really nice because I am not a fan of strong scents and I do react to some colognes. This seems like it would be great for people who have sensitivities to perfumes.  I really like this product.I love using the Hydrate I am going out walking.  It feels nice on the skin has a mild smell and has an SPF- sun protection. It is small enough to fit in my pocket or in the glove compartment of my car.Until I used this I didn't like using any type of sun protection when I went walking. I don't like the smell of most sun screens and have found them to be a hassle to use.This product is different. It feels nice on my skin it does not have a smell that reminds me of being on a beach or at a pool and it is small enough that I can carry it in my pocket and not really notice it. It is easily absorbed in my skin and I don't notice a greasy residue that I have found in some sun screens.This has gotten me to use sun protection when I am walking so this is a really good product.I like both products. One I use when I am out walking and in the sun and the other after shaving and when I am home and want my face to feel nice. A Review of Both the  Hydrate and Sensitive + Face Lotions,sensitive skin
My skin has become sensitive in the last year - getting rashes that even the dermatologist can't do much about. I've used this Dove sensitive face lotion on both my face and neck and found it quite soothing. It really has no fragrance that I could smell which is unusual and fantastic in a product that you put on your face and really would rather not be breathing in perfumed fumes all day long.It feels good going on and rubs in well and quickly. The bottle does consistently need more pumping especially as the volume goes down. I would prefer a tube or something without the pump but the lotion works fine as it is. Sensitive face lotion,Neutral
I had read the reviews before I bought this so many reviewers said this was the best they had ever used.  I would not say that.  It's ok far from the best I've ever used.  I am crazy for lotions.  I use creams lotions etc faithfully.  This one is just ok.  I will not buy it again but I will finish using the jar I bought.  It has a perfume smell rather than a clean fresh smell but it's not a heavy perfume smell.  I don't wear perfume since I prefer a clean fresh scent. Nice cream,Neutral
I love the convenience of he roll on. Some people don't like the tea tree oil scent but I like that better than some fake perfume smell. I do find that this works better at preventing breakouts than as a treatment for  existing ones- I prefer benzoyl peroxide for that. Please note that these are much cheaper in stores- about $. where I live. At that price I buy them several at a  time and use at least one up every month. GREAT FOR THE PRICE,Neutral
This is wonderful does not dry my skin matter of fact my skin feels smooth and looks very healthy after use perfect for everyday use as described ! and great to use under make up! i love this! only issue was the scent it didnt have a sweet smell but i guess thats a good thing because that means its not loaded with perfume or all sorts of unhealthy stuff! Great Product,great product
Argan oil is a perfect massage oil. It absorbs into the skin but also leaves a slick almost invisible layer that allows you to massage the skin very effectively without needing to use a lot. The bottle this comes in is a pump style bottle which allows for economical use. This oil is a blend of Argan coconut and avocado oils. My mother tried some of this oil on her cuticles and loved the results. I blend Argan oil with essential oils to make perfume as well. This oil is pink and has a very delicate fruity scent. I have tried a variety of Argan oils and this is one of my favorites.~The Rebecca ReviewI received this free for review. This review is my honest opinion. Wonderful as a Massage Oil,argan oil
I dye my hair a very dark brown color each month to help cover the grey hairs I've been plagued with since my early 's. Because I use a dark hair color when it starts to fade it's very noticeable. After years of trying different shampoos I've found that ones that are formulated to help retain hair color really do help some. It's not going to keep your hair color from fading at all but it does fade it less than shampoos not formulated in the same way.Before trying out this shampoo and the matching conditioner I was using Pantene shampoo and Garnier Fructis conditioner. My hair is quite thick and currently pretty long and I try to find hair care products that help keep my hair smooth and easy to manage. If I use something that helps retain my hair color and doesn't provide any kind of smoothing or shine my hair becomes dried out and frizzy. So I was eager to see how my hair would look after using this Suave Moroccan Infusion Color Care shampoo and conditioner. Neither have a lot of color or scent. The conditioner has a sweet scent that's unlike any other hair product I've used. The shampoo has a very mild scent that's also unusual. More of a soap or mild perfume smell than the typical citrus or floral scent.The shampoo bottle opens from the top and the conditioner bottle opens from the bottom. So even though they look very similar when the bottle are setting beside each other you can easily tell which bottle it which by how they open. After using them on my hair the first thing I noticed was that it was a bit easier to run my brush through my hair while it was wet. So the Suave conditioner made my hair less tangley after washing than my Garnier Fructis conditioner. After drying my hair I was quite pleased with how it looked and felt. It was smooth and reminded me of the was one of my favorite shampoos makes my hair look Pantene Ice Shine. I would normally always use the Ice Shine shampoo but it doesn't help hold in my dark hair dye. So I'm very pleased to find that this gives my hair the same look and feel as I get when I use my Pantene Ice Shine but with the hair color protection as well. So while it might not have bright colors and bold fragrances like some brands use the shampoo and conditioner do work very well. Mild scent and works well on my long hair,Neutral
This product has knocked out all contenders to become my favorite shampoo. First it lathers up perfectly which means I don't have to wash it a second time just to feel clean. Second it leaves my hair squeaky clean and smelling fabulous. Seriously I would love to have a perfume version of this fragrance! My New Favorite Shampoo,Neutral
I'm not sold on the color care part of this shampoo but I do love the smell of it and the way it lingers and it cleans just fine. I usually swap between Pantene and Aussie as I am one of those that believes my hair builds tolerance and I need to go between shampoos (I know I've read this is a myth but my hair disagrees lol). I really love the smell of this and don't think it's too strong however I also don't wear perfumes or anything like that so it gives me just enough scent through the day that I love and people have commented on my hair smelling good too. Recommended. Smells Great Gets My Hair Clean,Neutral
This shampoo sounded like a wonderful opportunity to find a conditioning shampoo for color treated hair that would not be too expensive to use every day.  Unfortunately I was disappointed but part of the reason for that is me and not the shampoo.My hair is very thick (I have a lot of hair) but each strand is thin and fine and very very straight.  I found that the shampoo was too heavy and that it made my hair so soft that it would not keep any curl or body.  This is a problem that I have with many shampoos that contain conditioning elements.  The shampoo also did not give me the squeaky clean feeling and sound that I like to have when I wash my hair.  Finally I really did not like the smell.  I tend to prefer unscented or lightly scented shampoos and lotions.  This product has a strong sweet and musky smell that I did not enjoy and did not want to have conflicting with my perfume.  My hair was indeed shiny and soft when I was done with the shampoo and conditioner but the other aspects of the experience made it less than perfect.I think that this product would be more appropriate for those with coarse or very curly hair or very dry hair.  I do not have those so it was not a match for me. OK shampoo but not for me,Neutral
This is a really good shampoo.  I'm not sure that I want to pay $. for it (cause I'm so cheap) but it gently cleaned my hair and rinsed out well.  I no longer color my hair and have decided to just go natural but I could tell that it was gentle on my hair.  I shampooed  times since it's been a couple of days since my last shampoo.  It has a scent but it's not overwhelming at all.  I am very sensitive to perfumes and can't tolerate but the barest amount of scent.  The scent this shampoo does have is most unusual and quite nice.

I've been using this shampoo/conditioner for several months now and have noticed some nice improvement from my dry and brittle ends.  It adds shine/moisture to my dry areas without making my hair oily. My hair feels softer AND cleaner (not like I've put detergent on it to strip it clean). That's all I really ask for.I'm not going to rant and rave. It's not a miracle cure. My hair still has issues. I still have to work with it fix it style it. But I like this Moroccan product better than any other non-salon products I've tried before.As for the SMELL (big subject with this one):Go to the stores and test the smell for yourself before you buy this!!It's one of those that you either will like it or possibly HATE it. Seriously. It's different.It's not a flower fruit perfume CLEAN nature smell like most cleansers.It has a spice cologne musk sort of scent to it. It's a heavy scent. It's strong when you're using it but it doesn't linger so much once washed out and out of the shower. Personally I think it just throws people because it's not the ~common~ type of artificial fragrance put in cleansers (they're all fake-used to fool you into THINKING you're getting cleaner anyway) but don't get this larger size bottle (this is twice the size of standard shampoo/conditioner bottles) before knowing the scent. Decent budget shampoo for moisture,Neutral
I've had this product for a couple weeks now. Overall i am happy with it but this is not a shampoo for everyone...What do i mean by that? Basically the scent while applying is pretty overwhelming (think heavy perfume) so unless you like the smell (which i personally did) it can be a major pain. The smell doesnt last more than an hour on your hair after showering though so there is that.Otherwise i love how quick and easy it lathers up and makes my hair feel nice and clean. very strong scent,Neutral
We have used Suave hair products for as long as I remember. They are usually the cheapest brand at anywhere from  cents to about $ a bottle so at the price they sell it on Amazon it's way out of range for the brand. I have no expectations for shampoos other than they will clean my hair and then wash out clean. The magic exotic sounding names on shampoo bottles (including this one) are laughable. Shampoo is only a bottle filled with chemicals and fragrances. We buy one bottle to serve everyone who uses the same shower.The fact that this one is supposed to protect color treated hair is meaningless to those who use it who don't color treat their hair. After using it a couple of times my observations are that while I don't mind the scent the fragrance is a little more intense than most shampoos and leans toward a woman's perfume more than the usual fruity scents. For someone with a very full head of long hair the lingering scent may remain to conflict with additional perfumes or colognes.The texture is thick and not runny. That is a positive I don't like squirting shampoo into my palm and having most of it drip out before it gets to my head.After using it absolutely nothing magic happened ... it's shampoo ... it cleaned my hair reasonably well and at the end of the day my hair still looked okay.  I'm giving it  stars because it's a little better than okay. It's shampoo,Neutral
I'm torn in my ratings for this shampoo. I have color-treated blonde hair somewhat dry--blonde hair rarely shines especially dry blonde hair. My hair was a little shinier after shampooing but the heavy fragrance overwhelmed me and I coughed for an hour after using this. The argan oil (Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil) is way down on the ingredient deck so there's no reason for the fragrance to be this strong (I use % pure organic argan oil on my skin and it barely has an odor other than a slightly nutty scent). I would have given this product  stars otherwise. Too perfumey I'd rather smell nutty argan oil,argan oil
Leaves hair smelling really really good.  Also leaves hair soft and manageable.  My daughter used this shampoo and her hair was so soft and lovely; I also kept thinking she had put on perfume then I realized that it was not perfume but this shampoo.  She said she loves this shampoo leaves her hair soft and manageable.  I sure do love the lovely smell from this shampoo.Highly recommended. Smells Like Perfume!!!!!,Neutral
Before using this Suave Moroccan Infusion shampoo and conditioner I was using Pantene shampoo and Garnier Fructis conditioner. My hair is quite thick and currently pretty long and I try to find hair care products that help keep my hair smooth and easy to manage. My hair is usually the softest after a deep conditioning treatment but then it can often be a bit weighted down and may not hold a curl as well. This shampoo and the matching conditioner makes my hair as soft and silky as it usually is after a deep conditioning treatment only it's also still style-able. Using Suave Moroccan Infusion my hair will still hold a curl and feels richly conditioned.Neither the shampoo or the conditioner have a lot of color or scent. The conditioner has a sweet scent that's unlike any other hair product I've used. The shampoo has a very mild scent that's also unusual. More of a soap or mild perfume smell than the typical citrus or floral scent.The shampoo bottle opens from the top and the conditioner bottle opens from the bottom. So even though they look very similar when the bottles are setting beside one another you can tell which bottle it which by how they open. After using them on my hair the first thing I noticed was that it was a bit easier to run my brush through my hair while it was wet. So the Suave conditioner made my hair less tangley after washing than my Garnier Fructis conditioner. After drying my hair I was quite pleased with how it looked and felt. It was smooth and reminded me of the was one of my favorite shampoos/conditioner brands make my hair look Pantene Ice Shine. I normally always use the Ice Shine but it's pricey and has a really strong overpowering fragrance. So I'm very pleased to find that this gives my hair the same look and feel as I get when I use my Pantene Ice Shine. So while it might not have bright colors and bold fragrances like some brands use the shampoo and conditioner do work very well.I also love the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care formula. I dye my hair each month a deep dark brown and the Color Care formula helps retain my hair coloring while giving it the same silky softness that this Shine formula does. Suave Moroccan Infusion is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner. My new favorite Shampoo,Neutral
This shampoo leaves my hair wonderfully soft! I LOVED the way my hair felt after using it.The smell...not so much. I'm pretty sensitive to strong smells and perfume. It's rare that I find a perfume that doesn't give me a headache. I've used the same one for years. This shampoo/conditioner is very strong like perfume. It gave me a sick headache after using it because the smell sticks around throughout the day. I think for most women this will be a plus side of using it. It didn't stink! I didn't hate the smell itself. I just didn't like how string it was.Overall if you're sensitive to smells pass this one up. If not I highly recommend it due to how soft my hair felt afterwards.

I'm not sure what to make of this but can say with assurance it's different. The fragrance is quite nice but not overwhelming nor likely to clash with perfume/other as it dissipates rapidly. Both my self and spouse liked the fragrance. The bottle itself is nice easy to use and convenient. It shipped securely and didn't spill. The actual use with nice enough...Lots of lather! In fact I could probably have used about / less than normal just fine. Initially the hair felt quite silky and does indeed shine but by the next day it felt dryer than usual. Also it should be noted this doesn't help with tangles whatsoever.So nice fragrance convenient bottle does shine but leaves hair feeling dry. Nice fragrance shine but dry,Neutral
I love the fragrance of this shampoo; it's pleasant and not an overpowering perfume.  It lathers up nicely and rinses out easily.  I had switched shampoos shortly before getting this bottle and my hair began catching in my comb and I thought that shampoo was miaking it frizzy or something but when I switched to Suave Morrocan Infusion my hair was easy to comb and felt soft and smooth.  I also began asking friends and family about my hair.  No forget the style.  Does it look shiny?  After staring at my hair the consensus is that my hair does look shiny.  I think it looks shiny too but truth to tell I've never spent a lot of time studying my hair. Smells good feels good looks good--and shiny.,Neutral
I find that there isn't that much variation in shampoos.  I can't use moisturizing ones since I have slightly oily hair but other than that a shampoo is a shampoo.  This one keeps my hair clean just fine.The scent is probably the most noticeable difference.  I can't place it exactly but it's more of a cologne scent than perfume.  It's not an overwhelming flower or fruit smell which I appreciate.  Some might find it too weird but I think it's a nice change of pace.As for the argan oil adding shine and all that . . . I haven't noticed my hair being noticeably more shiny.  It isn't dull but I think it looks nice because I take care of it rather than any ingredient du jour in the shampoo. It's shampoo,argan oil
I imagine that this is marketed to women but I ended up with a sample of this new Suave shampoo.  It's labeled for normal to dry hair.  I'd say I fit that bill.  It lathered up nicely and has a pleasant smell which I attribute to the oil in this line.  Hair feels clean and not overdone.  No chemical or perfumed smell.  Recommended.

My Hair Type: Long Thick Curly Frizzy and DryNormal Hair Care: Wash every other day no blow dryerThe shampoo:-----------Texture: Nice creamy- almost like hand creamScent: Light sweet almost perfume-y very feminineResults: I only needed to use a little bit and it lathered up a lot. It rinsed out easily and left my hair very soft and a little shiny. My curls and frizz were at their normal level though and I had to use an anti-frizz cream when it dried.

When I was younger I never worried about the kind of hair care products that I used because my hair looked good no matter what I used. Now that I'm older (late 's) the texture and brightness of my hair has changed. To that end I've been trying a steady rotation of shampoos and conditioners to try and get some shine back into it. I found that a lot of conventional home methods like using mayonnaise eggs oils etc. don't work much as I'd like them to because they are cheaper than buying higher quality products.The claim for this shampoo is that it uses a type of oil which is easily absorbed and produces a good shine. That means it ought to not weigh your hair down but still make it shiny. I can't speak for how this would work on fine limp hair but on my very thick long hair it actually lived up to its claim. It definitely is better than the big bottle of Dove shampoo that I pick up at Costco especially for my aging hair.The only drawback is that the scent is pretty strong. It's very perfumey and what is worse the smell seems to linger for a long time. I always was my hair before bed and I could smell it in the air all night as my hair was drying. If I worked in an office with sensitive people I'm not sure but this might actually trouble them as a lingering scent in my hair. So while this is very good shampoo it's not a great choice if you're sensitive to perfume-like smells. does add shine but strong scent,long time

This conditioner is nice and thick. It is not watered down and runny. It left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned probably because one of the main ingredients is a silicone. I have curly colored hair and I like silicone based products so this conditioner worked well for me. It smells a bit like a perfume but it is not too overpowering. great conditoner,Neutral
I have fine thin limp hair.  I must use a conditioner because my hair tangles terribly the moment water hits it.  My ideal conditioner would leave my hair:  detangled volumized and shiny with a light fresh scent.  This Moroccan Infusion conditioner does detangle but my hair is flat and lifeless barely shiny and - worst of all - heavily perfumed.  Ugh.  I'm throwing the bottle out. Not for fine hair,Neutral
My favorite conditioners are:VO Moisture Milks Strawberries & CreamBurt's Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate & SoyAvalon Organics Clarifying LemonAussie  Minute MiracleThe first three contain no cones (silicones) and the  minute miracle does. This Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion also contains cones. Depending on your hair you may do better with or without cones in your conditioner. The main functional difference being that you'd be well served to clarify your hair every so often if you're using cones as they can build up on your hair over time. I used to use the Aussie  minute miracle all the time when I was putting chemical hair dyes on my hair and nothing could ever moisturize it enough. Now that I use henna and cassia I find I never really NEED something as intense as that and also that I do very well without the cones. Still to use it once in a while can be nice and I had fun trying this Moroccan Infusion. I am always using the VO Moisture Milk and it makes my hair smell like Nestle Strawberry Quik so this was quite a change - the Suave product has quite a strong scent of maybe a sort of Disney version of what Morocco might smell like. I would say it's a unisex scent so guys shouldn't be afraid to use it but it is rather strong so I might worry that if you are around other people who are sensitive to perfumes and things it might cause problems for them. I also have a taste test coming up and I'm afraid if I showed up after using this on my hair I might be sent home without testing because the smell is pretty strong.The product made my hair feel very nice - as silicones do - and I can see myself using this again just not all the time. It was rich and moisturizing without weighing my hair down. Sometimes it might feel like the product didn't rinse off well in the shower but you will probably find it evaporates as it dries. decent cone conditioner with VERY strong smell,Neutral
After receiving a bottle of SUAVE PROFESSIONALS MOROCCAN INFUSION SHINE SHAMPOO and using it I didn't hesitate when I received an offer to try SUAVE PROFESSIONALS MOROCCAN INFUSION SHINE CONDITIONER.This product works great leaving your hair feeling silky and shinny. My sixteen-year old daughter who is very picky actually liked the shampoo saying it didn't leave her hair greasy like other shampoos tend to do.What I love about both the shampoo and the conditioner that I can't seem to get enough of is its smell. The fragrant is beyond words. An enticing scent that if I could I'd bottle it and use it as perfume. And it's not short lived. It continues throughout your day. My middle daughter said that she loved the fragrant so much when she was running in gym class she relished her hair flying in her face so as she could get a whiff of the scent. It's like being in a field of blooming wild flowers on a sunshine filled summer day with blue skies and white puffy clouds.Important Information* Infused with authentic Moroccan argan oil* Conditions hair while smoothing the cuticle to make hair shinier* Luxurious fragranceIngredientsWater (Aqua) Cetearyl Alcohol Dimethicone Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine Hydrogenated Coconut Oil Behentrimonium Chloride Fragrance (Parfum) Mineral Oil Lactic Acid Amodimethicone Potassium Chloride Disodium EDTA Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil DMDM Hydantoin Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil Methylchloroisothiazolinone Methylisothiazolinone.

This condition works well in my hair- it conditioned it and left it soft.  In the shower it has a soft non-oily texture and it spread through my hair easily.  The bottle is easy to hold and manipulate in the shower.  I ended up giving this four stars because the scent is not my favorite.  I tend to prefer floral/fruit/herbal scents and this has a scent that's kind of perfumey and hard to describe.  I'm guessing that this is the scent of argan oil.  All in all this product works well and if you like the scent you're good to go. Works well,argan oil
I am very sensitive to perfumes and scents in all types of toiletries but this conditioner has an absolutely lovely exotic and light scent.  It rinsed out well and all tangles combed out easily.  It didn't leave my hair quite as light and shiny and some other conditioners but I still like the way my hair felt after blow-drying.  I have no reservations about using it again and again. And there was no static fly-away which is always a pain to deal with. Suave Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner,Neutral
Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner has a very strong but inoffensive odor earthy and sweet at the same time.  It does noticeably condition the hair making it smooth and shiny but without leaving a heavy residue and making it easier to style. Good Conditioner but with a strong perfume,Neutral
I already love Suave products. They are so cheap and often are copycats of a much more expensive brand. (I love their Paul Mitchell knockoffs!) This Moroccan Infusion doesn't seem to add much more than normal clean-hair shine but I can tell you I love the scent! If you're looking for conditioner (and the shampoo!) that smells awesome give this a shot! No perfume sweet scent no fruit either! Just this warm yummy smell that reminds me of old-school conditioner before everything started getting scented with strawberry or apples. Love it! I'd buy this again! Love the scent! Shine? Meh. But my hair is color treated.,Neutral
I have been a Suave fan for a long time. But in the past year I started trying other products because I couldn't find a conditioner that actually made my long hair tangle free.This one did not disappoint.I have been coloring my hair for  years so it has chemical damage.I also have bleached highlights which causes MORE chemical damage.My hair is beyond the midpoint of my back - rather long.It has a medium texture. Not super thick and not super fine.In the FIRST use this was my observation:My hair had far less fly aways from pony tails sticking out.The hair lays nicely around my shoulders instead of bunching up around my neck.There was a slight shine to it that wasn't there with my Aussie conditioner.The texture of the hair felt very smooth to the touch but it was not heavy or greasy.I could run my fingers from root to tip in my WET hair and they came through with little resistance. That is something I haven't been able to do in years since before I started coloring it every  weeks or so.This is probably the best conditioner I've tried to date for overall look texture weight and shine. Far better than several expensive salon brands I've used including Biolage and Matrix.  I'm thrilled with it. And the price? I would definitely be willing to pay much more for this.  And on top of it all it smells wonderful. Sweet and spicy but not too perfumed.Highly highly recommended. Did not expect these results.,long time
Like its companion shampoo this conditioner is supposed to include a quick-absorbing oil that adds shine to your hair. This is one of my two major concerns for a conditioner. The other is that it make my super long very thick hair easier to comb out both when wet and dry. I'm happy to say that it was effective on both counts as well as made my hair feel better to the touch when dry. Sometimes I've found that conditioners make my hair feel oddly gummy after using a conditioner that otherwise makes it look great.The only negative point to this product is that it has a strong scent. I don't understand why manufacturers feel that they have to make hair care products smell like perfume especially not one that lingers all around your head like a halo for hours. If you're sensitive to scents this is not a good choice. However if you can tolerate them this is a very good conditioner that works well with dull aging hair in particular. makes hair manageable and shiny,Neutral
I dye my hair a very dark brown color each month to help cover the grey hairs I've been plagued with since my early 's. Because I use a dark hair color when it starts to fade it's very noticeable. After years of trying different shampoos I've found that ones that are formulated to help retain hair color really do help some. It's not going to keep your hair color from fading at all but it does fade it less than shampoos not formulated in the same way.Before trying out this shampoo and conditioner I was using Pantene shampoo and Garnier Fructis conditioner. My hair is quite thick and currently pretty long and I try to find hair care products that help keep my hair smooth and easy to manage. If I use something that helps retain my hair color and doesn't provide any kind of smoothing or shine my hair becomes dried out and frizzy. So I was eager to see how my hair would look after using this Suave Moroccan Infusion Color Care shampoo and conditioner. Neither have a lot of color or scent. The conditioner has a sweet scent that's unlike any other hair product I've used. The shampoo has a very mild scent that's also unusual. More of a soap or mild perfume smell than the typical citrus or floral scent.The shampoo bottle opens from the top and the conditioner bottle opens from the bottom. So even though they look very similar when the bottle are setting beside each other you can easily tell which bottle it which by how they open. After using them on my hair the first thing I noticed was that it was a bit easier to run my brush through my hair while it was wet. So the Suave conditioner made my hair less tangley after washing than my Garnier Fructis conditioner. After drying my hair I was quite pleased with how it looked and felt. It was smooth and reminded me of the was one of my favorite shampoos makes my hair look Pantene Ice Shine. I would normally always use the Ice Shine shampoo but it doesn't help hold in my dark hair dye. So I'm very pleased to find that this gives my hair the same look and feel as I get when I use my Pantene Ice Shine but with the hair color protection as well. So while it might not have bright colors and bold fragrances like some brands use the shampoo and conditioner do work very well. Shampoo and conditioner combo work well on my thick hair,Neutral
OK so before I review this conditioner what's in it?The ingredient List:* Water* Cetearyl Alcohol* Dimethicone* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine* Hydrogenated Coconut Oil* Behentrimoium Chloride* Fragrance* Mineral Oil* Lactic Acid* Amodimethicone* Potassium Chloride* Disodium EDTA* Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil* DMDM Hydantoin* Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil* Benzophenone-* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate* Methylchloroisothiazolinone* Methylisothiazolinone.This is a  ounce bottle and the price is extremely competitive.  Although the marketing is geared toward the product having argan oil that item is far down on the list of ingredients (Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil).  I would not let that dissuade you though.  There is a suitable amount of oils in this conditioner between the coconut oil mineral oil almond oil and argan.The fragrance is noticeable but pleasant fairly light and unobtrusive.  It is not flowery more perfumey/sweet.I would not over-use the product as a little goes a long way. Like many conditioners a dab or so is ample properly worked into the hair.  Also if you are using this product after its sister product Suave's Moroccan Infusion Shampoo the shampoo itself contains most of the same oils which help condition the hair.  The shampoo lacks only the mineral oil contained in this product while including Cocamidopropyl betaine a coconut oil derivative.The sweet almond oil is a nice ingredient for conditioning as it tends to lend sheen to the hair.I did not find that this product builds up or mats down hair nor does it leave hair greasy looking or feeling.  It really is a nice product.  We've tried it on thin hair color treated/damaged hair straight and curly hair in our family and it seems to work well on various hair types.If your hair is color treated or susceptible to frizz you probably will really enjoy this conditioner.  I would rank it up there performance-wise with many higher-priced products.  It really is a nice conditioner at a superb price point. Suave Smooth and.......Superior,long way
This conditioner is nice and thick. It is not watered down and runny. It left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned probably because one of the main ingredients is a silicone. I have curly colored hair and I like silicone based products so this conditioner worked well for me.  It has a perfumey kind of scent but it was not too overpowering. Great conditioner,Neutral
I'm not convinced as far as a color conditioner and I've also had better conditioners but been using this hand in hand with the Suave color shampoo for about a month now and I do really love the smell. I usually switch between Pantene and Aussie as I'm one who believes my hair gets used to one and needs to switch (I know this has been proven as a myth but my hair disagrees!). I have highlights and thought I'd give the color care a try but so far I really don't see any difference between this and my normal shampoos. But like I said I do love the smell! Very vanilly and it lingers a favorite scent of mine and I'm not one for perfumes so I dig it! Not too strong at all and I've received several compliments from people coming in to hug me saying my hair smells great! Recommended! Smells Great!,Neutral
A great follow-up after using Suave Moroccan Infusion Color Shampoo.  I was at first wary while applying to my hair because I could definitely smell the scent of this conditioner.  However after blow-drying I can just barely detect the faintest hint of scent.  I simply can't tolerate any perfume and can become ill if I have to endure smelling it for a long period of time.I no longer color my hair but I did notice that after blow-drying my hair definitely had a shinier sheen to it and felt very slick (in a good way).  The tangles were incredibly easy to comb out.  I like this condition a lot and will use it often. Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner,Neutral
I've been using this shampoo/conditioner for several months now and have noticed some nice improvement from my dry and brittle ends. It adds shine/moisture to my dry areas without making my hair oily. My hair feels softer AND cleaner (not like I've put detergent on it to strip it clean). That's all I really ask for.I'm not going to rant and rave. It's not a miracle cure. My hair still has issues. I still have to work with it fix it style it. But I like this Moroccan product more than any other non-salon things I've tried.As for the SMELL (big subject with this one):Go to the stores and test the smell for yourself before you buy this!!It's one of those that you either will like it or possibly HATE it. Seriously. It's different.It's not a flower fruit perfume CLEAN nature smell like most cleansers.It has a spice cologne musk sort of scent to it. It's a heavy scent. It's strong when you're using it but it doesn't linger so much once washed out and out of the shower. Personally I think it just throws people because it's not the ~common~ type of artificial fragrance put in cleansers (they're all fake-used to fool you into THINKING you're getting cleaner anyway) but don't get this larger size bottle (this is twice the size of standard shampoo/conditioner bottles) before knowing the scent.

Creates Soft Shiny Hair; No Frizz Control,little bit
I have highlights and lowlights in my hair and want to keep the color as long as possible.  Salon products (including the MoroccanOil products this is meant to work like) are not in my budget so I've been using Suave products for a long time.  Most recently I've been usingSuave Professionals Black Raspberry and White Tea Conditionerand the related shampoo.I was not expecting my hair to look or feel much differently than with the Black Raspberry (which is also for color treated hair) but was surprised at how different my hair felt -- even more than how much shinier it looked.When I use this. my hair feels so soft I just kept wanting to touch it.  It also looks very shiny. I don't wash my hair every day so the noticeable softness and shine go away between shampoos but not right away.The scent of this conditioner may take me a little while to get used to.  I'm used to a slightly fruity scent in my shampoo and conditioner.  This has an slightly spicy scent to it.  I'm sensitive to perfumes but this doesn't bother me.  It is just different than what I'm used to.I really like how soft and shiny this makes my hair feel and may switch from the Black Raspberry now that I've tried this one.I like that Amazon is offering this as part of the Add On program.  I keep a list of lower-priced items in my wish list for easy reference when I am ordering something that doesn't by itself qualify for Super Saver free shipping.  I'll put both sizes of this in my wish list so I have options depending on how far I am from the Super Saver limit. Makes my hair really soft and shiny,long time
I got this to try with the matching Suave shampoo and found it to be a very good conditioner but not as good asMoist  Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner  Fl Oz (Pack of )orGarnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner  oz.  It gets most tangles out of my long hair but not all on some nights.  The scent is strong enough to linger after your hair is dry but it doesn't give me headaches like many perfume scented conditioners.  I say it's more like a soft soap scent. Gets Most Tangles Out . . . .,Neutral
I used this conditioner after using the shampoo -same kind. The fragrance smells really good but it could be a bit too much if you use perfume on regular basis. My hair can get weighed down fairly easily with conditioners heavy with silicones especially Dimethicone but this conditioner didn't weigh down my curls. My hair is long about  below my shoulders texture is med-fine and I have some highlights. The conditioner didn't take care of all the frizz but it is winter so I might need extra help. Recommended to use with the shampoo they are not overly priced so it is a good pair to try. Lightweight,Neutral
Daverat's Wife Speaking: (please be kind about typos I have arthritis) This is everything I look for in a hair oil light conditioning a very light mist from the sprayer nourishing ingredients such as the Argan and Sweet Almond oil and all at a decent price point!  The instructions tell you to dispense the oil spray into the palms of your hair which is RIGHT FOR ONCE!  Yay!  Most other sprays tell you to spray it right unto your hair and that is just bad advice in my experience.  No one person has the same hair needs and it is far easier to spray the oil or squeeze drops of oil into your palms rub them together and then carefully disperse the oil product where it is most needed on YOUR head of hair.  It might be the thristy split ends the broken hairs at your part line the crown where have over-teased with a rat tail comb or just all over.The instructions are on the BOX and not on the bottle so keep the box until you are fully familiar with the product.  Frankly I think they could have cut another $ off the price by getting rid of the box and doing a peel-out instruction sheet  on the back label the way most hair care products do these days.  I hope they try that because the box is a huge waste of paper and it drives up the cost.  This stuff runs from $ to $ and it's SUAVE - the bargian brand.  Ditch the box and they can charge under $.  That's my only real complaint.I use other hair oils and get great results wwith them hair oils that are actually cheaper than Moroccan Infusions but that didn't prevent me from using and enjoying this product very much.  It performed as well as the other brands. The one difference is that this Oil has a very strong perfume to it.  It's not one that I dislike but it clashes with my normal fragrance quite badly.  I can't use this product daily because of that.  The Moroccan Infusion line has a very SPICEY scent to it that reminded me a little bit ofShalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Cologne Spray . Oz..  Remember Shalimar from the s thru s?  It's still very popular  & smells of sandalwood exotic bright spices vanilla almond and musk.  It's a sexy mysterious scent that men like more than women.  In fact every bottle of Shalimar I ever owned was given to me by a man!  If you are using a modern spicy fragrance and there are many popular ones this will fit in very well with your fragrance profile.  Many celebs have spicy signature scents nowadays that will match the Moroccan Infusions scent perfectly!Me?  I useCalyx By Prescriptives For Women. Fragrance Spray . Ounces which is a fruity melon guava and lightly orchidy kinda of clean and bright scent.  It clashes with the Spicy notes of the Moroccan Infusion Oil.  Boo hoo hoo!  Calyx has been my signature scent for so long that to go without it makes me feel naked.  I'm going to  crack open a bottle of Shalimar I got from my Dad a while ago and go for it with the Suave Moroccan Infusion Hair Oil and try it on a night out!So other than the spicy scent and the fact that this is MORE costly than equally good treatments such asCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil  Fluid Ouncewhich has a very light and clean scent that melts into anything you wear I would say give this a try!  It's great for your hair and cheaper thanmost Argan Oils.Start with less of the oil and add more as you go along if you feel you need it.  A very little goes a long way.  It adds a nice shine and even a little bit of golden highlights in the sun even on my auburn hair.  It's a good product and certainly cheaper than the first wave of Argan Oil treatments that were all the rave last year.  Pair this with a decent detangling comb that is NOT made of plastic (plastics always snags and pulls no matter what the manufactuter says) and you'll be well on your way to healthier hair.

My stylist has been using a similar product on my hair before flat ironing it for a couple years. I love the way it makes my hair look salon gorgeous. I started using  pumps but worked up to  pumps and that is just right for my dry hair. My hair now looks and feels silky soft and controlled all the time. I love the scent. I can't smell it about an hour later so it doesn't clash with cologne or perfume I wear.I use it before and after I blow dry my hair.  I also use it when I just let my hair air dry to let the curls reign.  It seems to protect the ends from splitting.I love the  ounce travel size I just wish they would have a  or  ounce size.Keeper! Perfect for my curly thick chemically treated shoulder length hair,Neutral
I have short gray hair and I like a little shine in it so I was very pleased with this product. It does not go on heavy or greasy but feels light. I do not have to use a great deal but one squirt rubbed in my hands then over and into my hair will do the trick. I have used it when my hair was dry and when it was a bit damp and I had great results each time.In comparison toPaul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum . Ounce which I have used for years this Suave styling oil performs the same but costs much less and is easier to find in the stores.One reviewer commented on the fragrance. I did not find the scent overpowering but it does have a warm spicy scent which is my favorite sort when choosing perfumes. I noticed that it disappears after about  minutes. Those who wear florals or fruity scents might find that this product clashes with your perfume. Perhaps Suave will come out with an unscented version.I'll use up my Paul Mitchell but after that Suave has my business. Give it a try- it's not expensive and I think anyone would be pleased with the shine and softness it adds to your hair. Great shine & price as good as P Mitchell Skinny Serum,Neutral
I use a salon brand Argan oil on a regular basis.  I thought I'd try this product since it is so much less expensive.  I had two thoughts:First it was heavier than the product that I use more like an orange oil or a silk extract.  It left my hair a little greasier than the results that I get from my regular product. (I have very fine hair).  Perhaps it felt heavier because this is a mixture of argan almond and coconut oils where the product I normally use is exclusively argan oil. Second I didn't like the strong scent.Conclusion: I won't be switching to this product despite the better price.My mom also tried the product.  She normally uses a Moroccan Oil product (mixed oils) from a salon line.  She loved the Suave. She said that she could not tell the difference between this product and the one she regularly uses. (She has grey hair that is dry and curly).  She also does not care for the perfumed scent but said it wasn't a big enough factor to prevent her from purchasing the product.Conclusion: She is switching to this product due to its lower price point and effectiveness.So if you are considering this product take into account what type of hair you have your expectations (what type of product you currently use) and whether you are sensitive to scents. Two Reviews,argan oil
My hair always looks better a day after washing but I hate how it feels so I wash every day. This stuff gives me that second-day look as soon as my hair is dry. My hair is softer and smoother after using it (although I still have to use an anti-frizz lotion). The fragrance is a bit perfumey but not obnoxiously so and it really doesn't bother me. It also works well when my hair is dry to smooth out any frizz throughout the day.The only negative is that it says it's a styling oil. I don't think so at least it doesn't add any additional hold to my hair. But my curls look great and my hair looks healthier so I'm happy. This product would be a bargain at twice or even three times the price. Second-day post-shampoo look right after shampooing,Neutral
I've heard the hoopla about argan oil. Suave finally makes it affordable enough to try it out. It does make your hair shiny easier to comb and healthy looking but as it's applied to hair (which is dead) I doubt that it does anything that actually benefits it or makes it healthier. Still who doesn't want shiny healthy looking hair at an affordable price? The shine is so drastic that my hair almost looks fake. The day after applying it my hair also feels somewhat heavier. I don't have time to fuss with my hair so I love that it's so easy to use. You just put it on damp hair and comb it through. It adds about  seconds to your routine. There is one word of warning however. This product has more perfume in it than it does argan almond or coconut oil and you can tell by the smell! It smells like insecticide so that is a bit of a turn off. When I stand in a big room it's not so noticeable but if you get in a small space- like a car- it can be overwhelming. Not a good thing.Break down-Price- A+Shine- A+Ease of use- A+Smell- C Shine? Yes but it comes with a smell,argan oil
I just got this in the mail and had to try it and write a review immediately!  First of all I like the pump design a lot and with the included cap and  ounce size this could totally travel with you.  It also smells great - very sweet almost like candy.  It reminds me a lot of Aquolina's Pink Sugar perfume.I put this on one side of my head onto dry hair avoiding the root area.  It went on very shiny but when it dried sadly I couldn't see a difference between the two sides.  BUT the treated side WAS a lot softer and smoother and looked better than the untreated side.  Yay!  On the bottle it says this is meant to be used on wet hair so I will use it as directed and then edit this review!  So far though I give it  stars for making my hair softer and smelling so good! I like this a lot!,Neutral
I usually love Suave products but this one is way too strong. The smell makes me sick to even use it anymore. I will have to give it away. Very disappointed. horrible overpowering strong unusual perfume smell,Neutral
I've used other hair masks before and this one is thin in comparison.  It comes out like regular conditioner.My hair is long medium texture and wavy and in fairly good condition.  The product did as advertised and made it extremely shiny.I loved the smell it's like a light amber based slightly oriental fragrance.  LeCroix VS's amber body cream or pure amber fragrance oil are the closest actual perfumes that I can think of for reference.  It's not very strong but if you do not like scented products you might want to avoid this one.  The scent lingers after your hair is dry for about a day.I did not have the entire product line to use only this mask and I left it on for the full  minutes.  It did deliver very soft shiny hair that wasn't weighed down.The price is great and the smell is wonderful.  I like to rotate all my hair products I find they all work better that way and this will certainly be something I buy again.  It left my very long hair looking good down to the ends which gets straw dry from sheer length. Great shine,Neutral
My Hair Type: Long Thick Curly Frizzy and DryNormal Hair Care: Wash every other day no blow dryerThe Conditioning Mask:-------------------------Texture: Nice creamy- almost like hand creamScent: Light sweet almost perfume-y very feminine (Smells like their shampoo and conditioner)Process: I used this with the matching shampoo. I only needed to use a little bit to cover all my hair. I left it in the full  minutes. (Instructions say -). It rinsed out quickly.Results: My hair did not feel oily or weighed down it rinsed very clean. It left my hair soft and shiny. Although I could not tell the difference between this and their regular Moroccan conditioner as far as the results went. I still had to use anti-frizz cream when it dried. My stayed soft and good smelling all day. Results Like the Moroccan Conditioner,little bit
I have been reviewing a few of Suave products for Amazon who offered them for free for my opinion. Some of my reviews my sound alike since they are all the same high quality items.I love this scent of the new line of Professional hair care products.I used this conditioner in conjunction with Suave Shampoo for colored hair. They work well together and again I stress that the scent of these new products is amazing. It stays with you for quite  awhile but does not compete with your perfume if you wear it.At first I thought it made my hair too soft but it just needed time to soak in. The next day after using these two products my hair was soft but manageable.This is another product I will be buying for myself... Leaves hair lustrous,Neutral
I have dry color-treated blonde hair styled in a medium-length layered cut. I always have lots of tangles to comb out in the morning after sleeping on my back. I left this in for  minutes after my shampoo then rinsed. At first the perfumey-scent had me choked-up (bad allergies to fragrances) but the scent seemed to dissipate. Now on to the rinse and blow dry. It was easy to get the tangles out my hair was not as dull as normal. I know this is marketed as a shine mask but my hair appeared to be fuller/thicker. Once I got past the scent I liked it - my hair looks thicker,Neutral
like all sauve products it does the job.  it does have a goooooooood rainforst smell.  since i shave me head i gave it to the wife to use.  she said that it is a good conditioner it does have a lasting smell so you gals make sure you match your perfume to the rainforst sent. sauve rainforest conditioner,Neutral
I've used Suave brand conditioners and shampoos for years.  They're very inexpensive and they do just as good a job as the more expensive conditioners.  I have used this particular Suave product (Rainforest Fresh) conditioner many times.  It's not as thick as some of the more expensive conditioners but just a little dollop of it will do everything the others do.  And this conditioner is not overly perfumed.  I am very sensitive to perfumed shampoos and conditioners and that's another reason I prefer Suave.  It smells great while using it but the scent rapidly goes away after blow drying.Also this bottle can be turned upside down when it gets almost empty so you can get the last bit of conditioner out of it.  I will put a little water in the bottle and swish it around to get the last remaining conditioner because even after it's thinned out with water it still detangles my hair just fine. Suave Rainforest Fresh Conditioner,Neutral
It says to use two pumps on wet hair but I had to use  to get the results I needed so if you have long hair keep that in mind. It did ok but for my Latino hair (I'm not black or white--mixed) it kept Most of the frizz at bay but not all of it. There was about % improvement compared to not using any product at all.Now the smell...ugh...Maybe some people like VERY STRONG VERY SWEET smells but to me it was WAY too much. It was a dissonant mix of vanilla and cherry both of which had a saccharine quality that was overwhelming as it was glaringly artificial. I am not using this again because of the stink that follows me but again I am very sensitive to the smell of perfumes and don't like strong sweet artificial smells. It's overwhelming. If you're like me don't buy this but if it sounds like a scent you'd like then go for it.OK product. Seen/smelled much better. works fine if you use more than directed; terrible smell,Neutral
We used this on my  year old daughters hair to keep her hair smoothed. Her hair is long and she also has alot of hair static. We've found that this also helped in dispelling that static from her hair. The smell is as advertised; some sort of vanilla/cherry mix. Its a pleasant light smell though and not heavy like a perfume or cologne. Either way it doesnt like very long (couple hours at most). Useful Kids Mousse,Neutral
The size is generous but so is the scent. It is a pleasant fresh scent but very strong- I would be reluctant to use it if I worked with people with allergies or perfume sensitivities.The shampoo lathers up a lot and quickly but took so much rinsing to reduce the scent that my hair felt quite dry afterwards.I think it might be quite good for a fraternity or something but not to pamper your hair. very scented a bit drying on my hair.,Neutral
I have always had confidence in Suave.The shampoo is excellent. Cleans my very thick shoulder length  year old highlighted hair beautifully with very little shampoo.  No residue - just healthy clean hair.I like the scent and it is perfect for days when I am not waring a perfume or cologne.Winner! QualityValue - DEAL!,Neutral
For those with normal or normal/oily hair this is a great product at an affordable price. Thick and rich a little goes a long way! Think dime-sized amount for short hair. The scent is kind of citrus with spice which the  men in my household like. It's not perfume-y or ultra feminine... more of a fresh scent that lasts... and I think it'd be suitable for women as well. My hair tends to be dry and when I tried the shampoo it left my hair in need of anti-frizz products but all of my guys have normal or normal to oily hair wash their hair on a daily basis in the shower and it works well for them. I wouldn't recommend it for dry damaged or color-treated hair. Nice Spicy Citrus Scent & a Little Goes a LONG Way,great product
I just love the new bottle:  I know the bottle is not as important as what's inside (and that follows in the next paragraphs) but we get new fragrances and new ingredients all the time.  We very seldom get a new bottle design that actually comforts your hand.  You can't see it too well in the picture but the bottle is more round than oval and fits my hand (long fingers) very well.  What's great about it is the plastic is more pliable than any other shampoo bottle I've ever used.  It is very easy on the hand and gives me great control over the pour.  The top is flat also which means you can easily stand it upside down to get the last drops.  The lid is easy lift and doesn't hurt my fingers when opening/closing.  If you've got arthritic hands this bottle will greatly please you.I have always liked Suave shampoos and conditioners.  To my mind they provide good value and you get a lot for a little:  You don't need to use a lot to get good foaming action; the product always gives my hair shine and a bit of a lift; it is lightweight both in the gel itself and how it acts on my hair and the fragrances are usually fresh smelling and not cloying or too perfumey or candy-like.This Rainforest Fresh fragrance in the Naturals line is no exception.  I especially like citrus-smelling fragrances and--unexpectedly--this Rainforest fragrance has it.  It is a light smell with almost limey notes; not easily identified as any one citrus and I think that is a good thing.The gel is definitely a gel and is not too thin.  When a gel is too thin I usually use too much.  This gel gives me some control over how much I squirt into my palm but it's not too thick that it takes forever to pour.  There is also extra control provided by way of a squirt hole. Like the scent; love the pliable new bottle!,Neutral
The shampoo lathers well; as a matter of fact I'll use less next time.  However I don't like the scent.  It's not too strong--though it goes straight up my nose when I smell the bottle--or too much like a perfume; I just don't like it.  I have soaps and shampoos with scents that I love but this is not a pleasure to have it trapped in the shower with me though I'll finish it up of course.  Or maybe I can switch it out with someone else's ... Good shampoo but it won't be a favorite,Neutral
I've never been disappointed with Suave.  My family uses many of their products from body wash to shampoo to hair spray.  They are quality products for a reasonable price.This is a new shampoo for me but I really liked it.  The scent was fresh and clean and not so like perfume.  I don't like strong scents.  It washed well.  I also used it for bubbles in the tub and it worked well for that use.  It left my hair soft with a nice clean scent.  My husband (who is very sensitive to scent and has many allergies) even commented that the scent was good for him.My one complaint is that I wish this was a shampoo/conditioner.  I like to use a  in .  I did use it without adding conditioner and am finding that it works fine.  But I'd like to see this scent in a combination shampoo/conditioner. Suave Products Are Great,Neutral
This is a thick gel that lathers up nicely. It has a mild fragrance - which I like since I don't like my beauty items full of perfumes. My hair came out nice and clean. Well -- what else can you say about a shampoo. So that's it. I like it,Neutral
Our daughters had fun using this gel to make some small changes to their hairstyles.  It isn't stiff or difficult to work with and the perfume isn't overwhelming. Not bad,Neutral
The minute I opened my box from Amazon to see the Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel my  year old daughter saw it and grabbed it as she shot over her shoulder What's this?  She spent a half hour in the bathroom playing with the gel and coming out with all kinds of hair styles she was playing with.She says that it smells similar to Feria Hair Dye perfume oil that comes in the box from the drug store.  I think she has a point there and do agree.My daughter really loves this hair gel (which she has claimed as her own) because it is not sticky or stiff but it helps you to style your hair and not stick it like glue.  You can comb through it but you can also count on some good hold.  She is almost impressed because there is not and residue.I have worked with my daughter's hair a lot and have to say that this gel is a nice styling gel.  It does make you need to wash your hair a little more often but it also does a good job holding in place all day and sometimes for two.  The tube colors and design make it easy to identify and find too which is a huge plus instead of being the typical plain mundane colors of so many hair products. My  year old LOVES this stuff!,Neutral
This gel does a good job of keeping your hair where you want it.  I tried it out on myself and liked how it held my hair.  I like my hair to have lift in the front and normally my hair goes totally flat.  The scent is barely noticeable and that's the first thing I check out in toiletry products since I am so very sensitive to perfumes.  It's a bit on the stiff side but definitely keeps the hair held in place.  I just wish the bottle was bigger because this will get used up fast. Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel,Neutral
This is a nice product for kids.  It doesn't have much perfume and it's not overly sticky nor does it leave them with a crunchy head.I tried it on both my boy and girl --both of whom have short hair-- and it provided light control of cow-licks and disobedient curls.  If they wanted a bit of spike it would do that and still leave hair soft with no flakes.That said I would add a caveat that I wouldn't use the Suave gel on my child's hair if it was longer.  If I did so there'd be no brushing or combing it just as if you had applied a lot of hair spray or adult gel.  And at least with my kids their hair needs brushing a few times a day to keep them from looking like they just rolled down a grassy hill.Would buy in the future. A Nice Product for Kids,Neutral
We like this kids gel.  It's light but holds nicely.  It's a clear gel and the scent is not strong.  After it's on the hair it just smells clean without that strong perfume girly or manly scent which some adult gels have.We really like that our hands are not sticky and gooey after we use it.  Some of the hair products we use are really hard to wash off the hands after we apply it to our hair!  Yuck.  We don't have that problem with this one.It holds good and depending on how much you put on you can make the hair spiky hard and wet looking or just tame the hair a bit.  We've used it on the edges of bangs to sharpen the look around the forehead and it looks nice.I'm not sure what age group of child would use this.  Once they reach a certain age the kids want to use adult looking products.  So this may be best for the under  or  group.  The container is very bright and colorful with  happy kids water-skiing.  Cute. Suave Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel,Neutral
I can't say I cared for this product. While the gel did an adequate job of cleaning it was over perfumed. The smell was strong and lingered. The menfolk thought it was just okay with those with oilier skin giving it a slight edge. No one was wild about the fragrance and no one noticed the stimulating micro-beads. The energizing effect like the woman magnet feature is illusory.  Sorry. I think there are superior cleansers that support a healthy skin care regimen without the heavy fragrance. Too Perfumey,Neutral
I love the fact that this face wash foams up it makes it easy to use. It also feels good going on and seems to wash off clean. What I'm not so crazy about is the smell. Sort of an old burnt coffee smell mixed with cheap perfume. Not pleasant. I'd prefer it with no scent or something more subtle and masculine. That said as face wash goes this is a gentle one and easy to put on and wash off. Oooooo that smell . . . :(,Neutral
My husband tends to use whatever facial soap I happen to have on hand but is never really happy with the way some of the products make his skin feel (or the smell). But he hasn't been too interested in any of the men's facial products either.  He likes the Axe brand of deodorant so I thought we'd give this a try. Having used this for a couple of weeks he says that this is one facial soap that he will continue to use.It smells good--there's none of the usual Axe heavy perfume. More importantly it creates suds easily and feels like it is doing what it claims which is reducing the oily feel on his skin. His skin is left feeling clean dry and soft and it continues to feel good. I second this!  I started using it because I liked the light scent better than the woman's product I was using--and it left my oily skin feeling soft and not dry.My husband says I have to buy more of this product since I keep using it too. It's a win. Your wife will like this too,Neutral
Most oil reducing facial scrubs work great on men's skin however there is one thing that most guys probably would change if they could - the glorious smell of flowers and perfumes.  My husband tried out Axe Oily Skin Face Scrub and has nothing but positive things to say about it.  The face scrub helps exfoliate his skin degrease those oily spots on his face without drying out his skin and smells like a citrus men's cologne.  I tried it out one day and it really got my skin feeling clean.  It's a great addition to the men's skin care line.  Recommended. Removes Oils without Drying Out Your Face,Neutral
The Axe Energizing Face Wash is a mild scented face wash that feels nice. I did not notice any real energizing boost but I like the way it feels and smells.I don't like men's products to smell like they contain some type of perfume. This does not. It has a nice mild smell that is similar to something you would find in a soap.It feels nice on my face and a little goes a long way.  I did not notice any energizing boost but certainly rinsing my face with this is a nice way to further wake up.This is a fine product with a nice smell.The Axe Foaming Face Wash is a mild scented face wash that feels nice. I like the way creates a foam once I put it on my hands. I use it before shaving and sometimes during the day esecially if I have just been in a meeting and I want to get moving again.I don't like men's products to smell like they contain some type of perfume. This does not. It has a nice mild smell that is similar to something you would find in a soap.It feels nice on my face and a little goes a long way. This is easier to use then regular soap.This is a fine product with a nice smell.The Axe Control Oily Skin Face scrub also has a mild scent and nice smell. I use it after an active day. I put it on my face and use a wash cloth to massage it into my face and then remove it.It makes my skin feel refreshed. I am especially looking forward to using it now that the weather is warming up.This is as good as the other two Axe products mentioned above. Nice Smell and Feels Good On My Face,long way
I got a chance to try out this Dove Men Care shaving gel recently and it's a pretty good product.  I usually use Nivea shaving gels and sometimes use Edge gel when I travel.  I like the Nivea products because it doesn't take much to work up a good lather and they rinse clean unlike some of the Edge products I've used which tend to leave my face feeling a little less than clean when I try to rinse them off.This Dove shaving gel is more like the Nivea products than the Edge products.  It doesn't take a whole lot to work up a usable lather and it rinses clean.  The fragrance isn't bad -- it's pretty mild compared to other products I've used.  The mild fragrance can be nice in the morning when you don't need a wave of industrial perfume smacking you in the gob.I got a good shave with this and my old Mach III razor.  No razor burn nicks or irritation afterwards.In all I'd use it again depending whether it or the Nivea is less expensive when I'm at the store. Good shave without irritation,Neutral
This is a bright blue gel. Pleasant to use with an exception.The scent is strong and soapy.I'm not sure if I am very sensitive to the scent but it results in a feeling of a sneeze coming on and my eyes tearing.I would've expected Dove not to over-perfume a facial product and find this product to be very disappointing.Again I feel the product would be better if unscented. Very Strong Perfume,Neutral
I usually use Nivea for Men products when I wash my face.  I gave this Dove face wash a try to see how I'd fare with a competitor's product.  In all it cleans well but I'm not thrilled with the fragrance.The product comes out of the tube as a white creme.  It washes well and rinses easily leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed not stripped or dry.  I give it high marks as a daily face wash in that respect.However it smell almost exactly like the Dove bars that my wife uses a sort of perfumey floral scent.  I don't know why Unilever decided to use that fragrance in a man's face wash.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not as though it leaves you smelling like perfume afterwards.  But when you're washing your face it's like sticking a Dove body bar under your nose.  That isn't exactly something that I look forward to in the morning when I'm waking up especially coming from the more refreshing scents I'm used to in the Nivea for Men products.I'd recommend this for its cleaning properties but make sure you can stomach the fragrance. Cleans well but has Dove bar perfume scent,Neutral
Yesterday I tried the combination of Axe's Chilled Shave Gel ContrOil Face Scrub and Chilled Post-Shave Gel.  Tonight I went with Dove's Men's Care Shave Gel and Face Wash.The surprise here is that (one) the Axe products barely had a perfume scent and (worked) really well.With the Shave Cream however I think that the Dove is better and has both a stronger foam and covers the skin area more thoroughly.  The Axe's lather was not as thick but got the job done.The Face Scrub however is a different story.The Axe's ContrOil Face Scrub has those micro beads in the lotion and the friction against the skin exfoliates.  The Dove feels okay barely thicker than regular soap lather.  Both have a slight not overpowering scent to them so the big difference is in the formula.And for me the difference favor's the Axe. Good But Not As Good As Axe's Facial Scru,Neutral
I've only recently started using Dove's personal care products for men. (I guess you can't still call them beauty products right?) So far though you can definitely call me a fan. I've been trying out this face wash and have been very pleased with the results so far. I typically use this after I shave which isn't every day. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh without being greasy or stinking of perfume. I probably should have gotten the sensitive skin variety since I definitely have sensitive skin. But so far no problem with breaking out or anything. Another winner from Dove! Great for guys,sensitive skin
This Dove Men's Hydrate+ Face Wash has a pleasant fragrance much like a men's cologne or aftershave and it lathers very well. It has a lotion type consistency and feels somewhat thick right out of the tube. It rinses easily and seems to do a good job of cleaning my skin. It provides some hydration but with fairly dry skin like mine my face still felt a little dry after using it. A moisturizer like Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Post Shave Balm might be a good idea unless you have oily skin to begin with.I like that Dove is doing a men's line of face washes and moisturizers. For a long time my husband was stuck using women's moisturizers or just using a hand and body lotion on his face when it felt dry. Those came in assorted fragrances many of them too flowery or perfumey for him. These Dove products are nice because they have more masculine scents without having too much fragrance. They wouldn't conflict with a different men's cologne. Nice fragrance and creates a good lather,long time
Though this does not work into a very frothy lather it still leaves skin feeling very clean and soft. It doesn't irritate the skin in any way - living up to its sensitive skin label. It has a very nice smell too that isn't super perfumey or cologney and just clean and fresh. Clean Smelling and Leaves Skin Soft,Neutral
I used this Axe post-shave gel after using the Axe Control Oil facial scrub and Axe's Chilled Shave Gel.The products works great individually but compliment each other very nicely and without the heavy perfume scent of Axe's other products.The Post-Shave Gel went on smoothly and dried relatively quickly.Face felt great for the rest of the day. Great as a part of a package.,Neutral
This . ounce container of Axe chilled cooling face hydrator and post shave gel may last for a year!!  Unbelieble how far a tiny squirt will go.  AND man is it smooth and refreshing during and after a shave.  The scent is clean and fresh with no flowery perfumey hint.  Your skin feels so slick and hydrated after the shave you will thing it is silk!  This is mighty good stuff and it came from Amazon.  YOu would be wise to give it a try before the host sweaty summer gets here to dry out your skin.  Get it at Amazon for a decadent price.Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel Chilled Cooling .

This stuff smells amazing feels amazing and doesn't dry my hands out.  it's January right now and I've been using this for  months.  It lasts forever (we have it set to dispense about a dime size) and it never dries out my hands.  I use it - times while I'm making dinner some times (handing raw meats) and everything else dries my hands out.  It's a gentle smell.  I don't do well with over powering things or things that want to compete with my perfume (like bath and body works).  the smell is there but it's not going to be noticed before you are. I use this in my Simple Human Auto dispenser and love it,Neutral
I love it when products work as described.This shampoo did wonders to smooth my hair.  I can feel the difference in the shower - I am instantly able to run my fingers through my hair with no pulling and tugging.Usually I need to use a lot of shampoo to get a good lather but I am able to get away with using just a small amount.  The shampoo rinses out nicely and it doesn't leave the shower area slick or grimy.My hair is easier to blow dry and looks and feels shiny and soft.  No more fly away frizzy looking hair.And the scent is wonderful.  It's not a strong perfume smell - my hair just smells clean and really fresh. Clear Scalp and Hair Frizz Control Shampoo,Neutral
When you reach the age of dirt it is wonderful to see a person with any hair left and thankfully most of mine still remains and demands cleanliness.  Thanks to products like Dove Men+Care Fresh Clean I can continue supporting most of those old gray things.  I had original reluctance to the shampoo  when I read the description; however those concerns (in particular with caffeine in the product) were quickly allayed after the first two uses.  I was not sure the reason for the caffeine and in a way did not really care.  It did not keep my hair up as coffee will do at night so it was just there for the satisfaction of the chemical staffers I guess.  Regardless of any of the chemical additives the one that for me makes a real difference is menthol.  So many of the men's shampoos are diluted with cheap smelling manly perfumes or stinkers but the menthol smell is absolutely fantastic.  It is not unbearable nor overpowering.  It's just there to add a refreshing scent without being overbearing.  It has left my hair clean manageable and easy to comb.  My routine is so simple: wash rinse wash rinse towel dry slightly comb and wait for some natural drying and go.  Bottom line:  Dove has a returning customer. It Works Well and I did NOT loose any hair,Neutral
This is a really great shampoo. It comes out in a lightly scented opaque gel and lathers well. It rinses clean yet my hair felt soft and silky after use. The fresh light scent disappears after drying and it doesn't leave behind any perfume smell just a light fresh scent. The menthol and caffeine feel invigorating but not tingly or burning. This is a great  in  shampoo it may just be my new favorite. Love this shampoo,Neutral
It really creates good texture for my hair according to those ingredients listed and it smells perfume as a bonus touch to my body. Nice smell,Neutral
My super pin straight hair needs only the lightest conditioning anything more creates a limp helmet.  This conditioner is a bit too much for me.  However it works well for my niece who has very curly moderately coarse frizzy hair.  She finds this to be a great moderately priced conditioner for everyday use.  We both LOVE the scent which is light and not perfumey.  She describes the scent as delicious. Works for curly hair,Neutral
I am going to write comments for each day of using the product.Day  - the dental hygienist who I see every  months commented how nice my hair looked a casual observer in a ladies room commented that she liked my perfume - I explained that it was the smell of my hair.Day  - another person commented how nice my hair smelled.Days  and  - washed my hair in the shower on a tiled floor at the gym - floor became very slipperyDay Off - seems tedious to wash my hair every day - so I take a day offDay  - my hair is so silky it falls in front of my eyes while I am playing the piano it also slips out from under my bike helmet hair is very softDay  - hair is more shiny and is flattening (less frizz)Day  - hair looks shiny and feels silky husband likes itMy regime was not to use any conditioner or shampoo during the test. I would rinse my hair thoroughly in hot water then apply the hair cream. The first  days I put it in my hand and then rubbed it on my head. My hair is very thick and it was hard to get it through my hair on to my scalp. The tubes could have been  times as big to thoroughly coat my scalp - I only had enough to cover the top and front sides of my head. On Day  I used the probing nozzle of the tube to get the cream directly on to my scalp - there still wasn't enough cream. My conclusion - the packaging is quite wasteful - why not have a single bottle with a cap to measure and markings on the side of the bottle?I wrote an email to Unilever asking whether this was a substitute for shampoo and conditioner or whether it was to be used as a standalone product. I didn't receive a reply - or if I did it went to a spam filter or junk mail.I compared the ingredients with those ofCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner . Fluid OunceandCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo . Fluid Ounce both of which I have reviewed on Amazon.  Most of the ingredients in the -day treatment are found in the shampoo and/or conditioner.Ingredients in all three products are:DimethiconolDMDM HydantoinFragranceMethylisothiaszolinoneTEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonateWaterAloe Barbadensis Leaf ExtractAscorbic AcidGlycerinGlycine Soja (Soybean) OilHelianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed OilHydrogenated Coconut OilLysine HCINiacinamidePanthenolPrunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) OilSodium ChlorideTocopheryl AcetateZinc PyrithioneZinc SulphateIngredients in the shampoo and -day treatment but not the conditioner are:Citric AcidDimethiconeIngredients in the conditioner and -day treatment but not in the shampoo are:Cetearyl Alcohol - emulsifier foaming agentBehentrimonium ChlorideDipropylene  GlycolIngredients in the -day treatment that are neither in the shampoo nor the conditioner are:HydroxyethylcelluloseParaffinPyrodoxine HCISeed OilSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate  (Vitamin C)Trideceth- (defoaming agent)The conclusion is that my hair feels silky and my husband likes the feel. The little tubes could be convenient for taking to the gym. For home use using conditioner and shampoo will give you almost all the ingredients. So the -day treatment seems a repackaging with minor changes of existing products. It was fun to try the product but it is labor intensive to use and wastes packaging. So in the future I'll stick to shampoo and conditioner leaving my hair to rest a few days between washes. A day by day review,Neutral
Clear  Day Intensive Treatment is a deep conditioning treatment with different kinds of conditioning agents and oils to treat damaged hair. It comes with seven . oz. tubes and the idea is to use one each day for a week.The conditioner works well leaving the hair shiny and smooth reducing frizz and adding body without making it greasy.  It rinses out well with warm water.  The amount in one tube may not be quite enough for large quantities of hair and the floral perfume isn't my favorite. Deep conditioning,Neutral
My hair doesn't get a lot of chemical processing (frankly I'm way past due getting the gray covered) and I don't blow dry it much (not many folks at the office care if we're perfectly coiffed or not) but it's always nice to give it some extra pampering anyway. The hair therapy comes in a box with seven very generous tubes that you're supposed to apply for seven days running for full repair. There was more than enough in one tube to cover all my hair plus some left over to share or use another day. My hair came out very soft and shiny this is a product I would use again. My only minor quibble is the scent is a bit strong but I am sensitive to strong perfumes. I got a blast of the scent just opening the packaging it arrived in and that's with the product box unopened. Still it did dissipate rather quickly after it rinsed or I got used to it. Not sure which :) Really softens with just one treatment,Neutral
This scalp and hair therapy is intended to be used daily for  days. Since I rarely wash my hair daily as I have very dry scalp and dry-to-medium hair I just used it for  consecutive hair washes.THE GOOD:I did not find this treatment miraculous but I did notice subtle improvements:. My hair felt softer and smoother (less dry and flyaway than before).. My hair looked a bit shinier.. My hair seemed to hold its style better and longer even after sleeping which is great since I do not shampoo daily.. The texture of the product is pleasantly mousse-like.. There is a HUGE amount of product in each tube though it may not appear so from the size of the tube. I have short fine hair and I could easily get  treatments from each tube if not . Those with long thick hair would probably be the only ones who would need to use a whole tube (I considered this a plus for ME because I could get more than  treatments from the box--a bonus).THE SO-SO:. This isn't just called a hair therapy--it's called a SCALP and hair therapy--so I expected to see SOME difference in the condition of my dry scalp. The box says Each treatment tube deeply nourishes the scalp... but my scalp was just as dry and itchy after  treatments as it was before.. This product has the words Color Repair under the title but there isn't another word about what that means on the box or product page (that I could find) other than the words Proven color-safe which has nothing to do with how it's going to repair my color whatever that means. (Note: My hair is single-process colored in a salon.). There is a perfumey fragrance to the product but it hasn't bothered me while showering (though when I just smelled a tube while writing this review it was noticeably perfumey and I felt the need to go wash my hands).THE BAD:) This product made my shower floor DANGEROUSLY slippery especially in areas where the water doesn't directly hit the floor. I almost fell twice. My usual conditioner is very thick and yet does not make my shower floor slippery. This lead to my lowering my rating for this product by / to  star.) Neither the box nor the tube contain clear instructions. The tube in fact contains no instructions at all. The box just says Gently massage  tube into scalp and hair daily for  days. That doesn't tell me whether my hair is supposed to be wet or dry before I apply the treatment whether I'm supposed to replace my usual conditioner with this tube or use this in addition to my usual conditioner. The instructions on this product page are a BIT clearer. They say:After shampooing gently massage  tube into scalp and hair daily for  days. Leave on for - minutes then rinse. Use when in need of intense damage repair or every  months. I ASSUMED that I was to use the product on wet hair in place of my conditioner but until I came to the product page to look for directions I didn't know for sure. That is just stupid.In summary Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy is a fine product that did provide SOME improvement in the look and feel of my hair (though not my scalp) but care is needed when using it in the shower as it can leave the shower floor dangerously slippery.  / stars (rounded to  as Amazon doesn't permit / stars) Hair is softer but shower is slipperier.,Neutral
It takes forever to wash out because it is so thick.The product comes out like Aqua Fresh - striped colors.It is OK I just personally hate spending  minutes soaking it in and another  minutes rinsing.A low odor low perfume product which is a plus for me. It takes forever to wash out because it is so thick,Neutral
My husband and I usually use a - Dandruff shampoo by Head and Shoulders.  I find that I still have to use a separate conditioner with that product as it is too drying for my hair.  Clear Men Scalp Therapy is truly a - shampoo.  I don't need extra products so I am saving money by using this shampoo.Both my husband and I liked the feel and the smell of the shampoo.  It seems to have a very light and fresh herbal scent - not at all what I associate with a man's shampoo but certainly not flowery or perfumey. It seems more unisex in its fragrance.My hair feels moisturized and has a lot of bounce - nice as conditioners sometimes weight my curly hair down.  My husband says his hair feels soft and clean and his scalp is noticeably less dry and his dandruff is under control equally well if not better than with his standard shampoo.I recommend the product and will be buying it again in the future.  We like to rotate a couple of shampoos to keep build up down on our hair and this product has made the rotation list. Really nice light shampoo with conditioner,Neutral
It has a strong perfume smell and the lather is ok.  Husband is fine with using it but it's nothing special.  Works for dandruff and leaves his hair soft. Smells like men's cologne,Neutral
Everything is good about this product except the overly strong scent.  It's definitely made for young males who are into smells.  I used it and was impressed by the electric teal color it had.  It lathered up well and rinsed out nicely plus my hair was easy to comb out - no tangles.  And my hair feels very clean.  It's just the scent.....I can't tolerate strong perfumey scents.  I don't think I'll let my husband use the rest of it because I'll still have to smell it all day on him.  But otherwise this is a great product. Axe  in  Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo,great product
The -in- (Total Fresh Head to Toe Clean) is just a repackaging of the regular Axe liquid body wash.I use Axe all the time it's one of those staples I pickup at Family Dollar when I'm in the neighborhood.Axe products are have a heavy lather but the liquid is opposite of Dove primarily a soapy perfume.  Nothing more.  And unless you perspire very easily there's no immediately need to use perfume or deodorant.Axe is perhaps on the same level as Suave a good generic body soap.  A much better product is the Dove Men's Care line. Very heavy perfume scent but typical Axe!,Neutral
Nowhere is there a rule that women can't use these types of things especially if you are like me and hate floral perfumey-scents in shampoos and body washes. Although I was taken aback by the bright teal color when I first squirted it onto the sponge. This has a fresh clean scent I wouldn't say manly just fresh and clean. The shampoo was OK too but I did have to add some extra conditioner to my hair to get the tangles out. My boyfriend likes this too but since he doesn't have as much hair he had no tangles so the conditioning aspect of this -in- product worked out OK for him. Good stuff even for women if you like a clean fresh scent,Neutral
This has a strong hold gives ridiculous spikes if you want them and has a pretty reasonable fragrance.  This is a good product for short hair. Not too perfumey,Neutral
Unlike gels this doesn't really have hold. The hair gets spiky-looking and very separated if that's what you're going for but you can't make it do specific things like a Mohawk or larger spikes. As for the smell it is pretty strong and perfumed--kind of obnoxious. This stuff is useless and smells bad and unless you are going for an overall spiky look that you can't control this isn't the right product. no hold very perfumey,Neutral
I'm not going to gush over a hair gel but that's just me.  I have relatively thin hair (in texture not amount) that I do cut short and then spike accordingly.  I like to maintain the appearance of a controlled mess make it look like I haven't thought much about my appearance.  I know that Axe has been expanding their hair care market and this is the first product that I've tried of the new line.  I grabbed it specifically because of the name.  After all Axe Spiked Up Look Spiking Glue certainly sounds like an ideal gel for someone who spikes their hair.  I figured that out because spike is used twice on the label.  Smart huh?As they say a dab will do you.  I apply a very small amount between my finger tips and spread it into my hair before it dries.  Then I use my fingertips to achieved that mussed look that I'm known for and as it dries it stays in position.  There is a distinct Axe fragrance (which I could live without) but it's not overly perfumey or obtrusive.Does Axe Spiked Up Look Spiking Glue work?  I've been satisfied.  It's not going to revolutionize hair gel or anything but it is effective enough.  KGHarris /. Effective Gel: Nothing Particularly Unique But Gets The Job Done,Neutral
Well this outlasts anything I've tried to make it do!  So I will recommend it!I also like that it's not horrible sticky or impossible to wash out.  Huge plus there.However I do wish it were unscented.  It smells nice is not overwhelming but will compete with other scents you are wearing.  The scent is also in my opinion distinctly masculine.  (The fact that it is distinctly masculine is neither a positive nor a negative in my opinion: it's great that men have an alternative to more feminine styling products but an unscented version would have been more gender neutral)Recommended with  stars for those who like the smell of Axe products and like dramatic hair styles without dramatic fuss when washing out. Perfumed.  Not too sticky. Lasts.,Neutral
This product works well for me in terms of hold but it makes your hair look dirty and dry all day and a bit gross overall.Also the scent is a bit too perfume like and too strong as well. Very strong hold but makes hair look dirty,Neutral
As soon as this arrived from Amazon we just had to try it. This stuff is thick but he had no trouble spreading it through his fairly short hair cut. He rubbed it in very nicely and then used a fat comb to finish it.  The results were perfect just the right amount of hold. As it dried it became stiff. I like the look and I really like the way he smelled.It did not have an overly perfume  scent but a nice subtle man scent.  It did not overpower his cologne.Of course I could not resist trying it on my hair. I rubbed it in thoroughly and spread it around I used a bush with very little tines so it allowed the spikes.  I must say I like this myself we may be fighting over it.  In the summer when I cut my hair very short this is going to be what I slather on to give me that stiff wet look. I will even get a spike or two out of it.... Great spike,Neutral
This smells citrusy...huge improvement over the nasty strong cologne scents from Axe in the past.  Historically I refused to allow Axe products in our home they stunk like cheap cologne.  That has changed apparently and since my son falls for their marketing that he'll be a babe-magnet with Axe products I can now allow him to be the Casanova he envisions.This holds my son's hair with a slight shine but not stiff and crispy. He likes it a lot and it holds in the style he desires...he has medium/short hair and does that combed forward and pointed up in the front thing.  He really likes this product. Smells Clean Not Perfumey,Neutral
I have wavy hair and usually after I go in for a cut they tend to trim it too short.  This happened to me just as the new Axe Wet Shine Gel arrived so I decided to try it instead of theAxe Styling Gum Messy Look . Ouncethat I usually use when my hair is longer and I want my curls to separate.  Just a small amount worked into damp hair does the job.  I've worn it slicked back for going to a club and just used it as a touch up product to keep the cowlicks down.  It works both ways. If you want to look really slcik you just use a little more.  You don't need a lot.  It's an economical product.Like many of the Axe hair products it has that distinct spicy but fresh & masculine scent which fades very quickly.  I read one review that called it citrusy and I have to politely disagree.  I would say it smells more like some men's colognes but not overpowering.  The scent has some peppery overtones to it as well as some grassy notes.  It sure doesn't smell like my wife's mandarin orange & lemon based grooming items but different people smell different things.  My wife has some perfumes/colognes that I could say are in the same vein as this.  If you are a gal and like strong spicy scents and don't wear body scents this wouldn't be a bad choice.  However  when I smell it it reminds me of high end men's shaving cream and I don't mean that in a bad way.  I asked my wife just now to try some on and she now wants to wash her hair!  The mild scent is too masculine for her and yet she likes it on me.  To each their own!I find this works best on damp but not wet hair.  When it dries it doesn't leave you with helmet head.  You can comb through it and still keep some hold.  If I feel the need to refresh it's hold I usually just splash some water on my hands run them trhough my hair and then re-comb it.  SO far I have not seen it flaking off when dry but I don't use handfuls of the stuff.  Just a dime sized amount or double that if you want a real sleek look works.  It's a very good product for me to use right after a haircut. Helpful for when I've just had a haircut - helps my curly hair lay down,Neutral
After trying a number of AXE products I was afraid that this too would be highly perfumed.  Fortunately it has no real scent. Straight from the tube it smells faintly of coconut but once it's in your hair you really don't notice it.It has a good clean hold not greasy or sticky feeling.  It gives your hair just a little stiffness - perfect for when you get your summer cut.  My hair is Air Force short being about a # or # clipper on the sides and back.  It's pretty wiry stuff so thinner products usually aren't enough to banish Bed Head Good clean hold with no scent,Neutral
This is almost identical to the Anti Dandruff right down to the fragrance.I like the Anti Dandruff because it is cream is not heavy and not too perfume-y.You can easily style your damp hair with this and still come out looking the don. Identical to the Anti Dandruff,Neutral
I expect Axe products to be overpowering and perfumey.  This isn't.  The scent is light and not at all overpowering. I don't have dandruff but do sometimes find a dry scalp accompanies using too many styling products.  A tiny bit of this gives me lift and control all day without crusty stickiness.  I also like that it is formulated to not cause dry scalp.I like it.  Don't use too much! Surprised by the scent!,Neutral
I'm a fan of the sexy tousled look also known as bed head and beach hair.I have tried many products and a few homemade concoctions to achieve that look without a trip to the beach.  I have very thick hair that tends toward waves.Many of the spray products for beach hair leave my hair looking greasy and weighed down.  I want the tousled and salted look  but I don't want my hair to look like I just haven't washed it in a few days.So far this is the first one that does the job and that I will turn to first.  All of the others do what this does but this one is my favorite.Why?-Small portable container.  Non-liquid for travel. It is a mini shaker with a closable top.-Lightweight doesn't weigh down my hair.-Easy and quick to apply.-Non-fragrant.  The ingredient is un-scented.  Can't class with my favorite parfum.-Almost acts like a dry shampoo (albeit one that you don't brush out)  and absorbs oil.-Doesn't make hair look greasy or shiny.-Easy to finger style hair increasing the beach look.-Doesn't leave my hair feeling like it's dirty with product.  I don't necessarily have to shampoo that evening or the next morning.-Colorless.  Looks whitish in my hand but doesn't appear dusty or like flakes when applied to the lighter and darker parts of my hair.The cons?  This stuff is extremely light weight and almost invisible.  I spent a few minute applying nothing to my hair (the container was closed and I didn't have my glasses on) and thought the product just wasn't working for me... I was wrong. Problem solved.  If you shake it into your hand and then apply it it's easier to see how much you are dispensing.  I just put it along the top of my hair and then finger combed it downward and twisted little bunches of my hair with a little more product as need to get that separated tousled look.The container is black and opaque and the product so lightweight that it's hard to judge how much is left in the container.  I'll definitely pick up a backup container as this is the one styling product I've found that helps me achieve the look I want without leaving me with a greasy perfumey product hangover.Random fact:  This stuff is made from the same ingredient that is used to make aerogels...  No wonder it's so light! Strange but wonderful.,Neutral
I probably don't have the right kind of hair for this trendy product--too fine and too thin.  BUt what a fun change of pace from my usual style which is a conservative swept-back look.  Not for everyday but for a concert date or other fun activity a wonderfully useful and novel product.I was relieved by the way that Axe wisely made no effort to perfume their Dust with one of the signature stenches. OK OK...I use Axe body spray sometimes too.  But a little goes a long way strong-smelling as they are and if Dust had been as aromatic (let's say) as some of their other products I would have been afraid to use the amount necessary for to achieve the gravity-defying effect.I'm not sure Axe can keep extending their brand endlessly but this seems like a very welcome addition to their little grooming family. Look like an astronaut in space!,long way
Fighting dandruff especially in the winter when conditions cause it to get worse is important to me. This does the job.It has Pyrithione Zinc which I look for in all shampoos.

This Dove Men's Care line is definitely a good line.I have tried a few of this line and I'm very very impressed.  Whereas the regular line-- the lotion-y formula-- is largely for women the Men's care line is decidedly masculine in fragrance and feel.It takes a page from the Axe White Rain and Brute style but has better ingredients and there's a cleaner feeling without the excessive perfumes the others are known for.A very very good product. The Dove Works For Me.,Neutral
Before my husband tried this shampoo on his hair I tried it on my shoulder length fine textured hair. The scent was mild and not overly perfumey and it had kind of a gel/lotion consistency right out of the bottle. It was a masculine type scent a little citrusy. It lathered well and rinsed out easily. I used a Morrcan Shine conditioner and dried my hair as usual.  My hair had a fluffier feel to it more body and felt really soft.  When my husband used the shampoo he thought it gave his hair a nice texture and he liked the fragrance. The label says it contains caffeine and calcium. I'm not sure how they would be absorbed into the hair strand but my hair did look shiny and full after using it. This shampoo adds some texture to hair,Neutral
The older I get the more concerned I am about the health of my hair.  This is both a shampoo that fights dandruff as well as shampoo that hopefully will keep my hair from thinning. So far I like it.It has Pyrithione Zinc which I look for in all shampoos.  This seems to help fight dandruff. It also has caffeine which I think helps with scalp health.This is supposed to strengthen and thicken hair. It is too early to tell if it is doing that.

I love this product!  I thought I would be turned off by a strong perfume scent but it hardly has any scent at all and what scent it does have is very nice.  It lathers up well and rinses out extremely well.  I know it's for men but as far as I'm concerned shampoo is shampoo and women can use it too.  I was able to easily comb out all the tangles so for guys with long hair this product should do you just fine.  After I blow dried my hair I was very pleased with the texture and sheen.  Also I noticed very little static fly away.  I really like this stuff! Dove Men+Care Sensitive Fortifying  in ,Neutral
I've used many Dove products over the years.I ordered this  in  shampoo/conditioner for when my dad comes to visit me but I decided to try it too.For some reason I prefer more men's fragrances than women's they don't smell as perfumey like some women's fragrances do some of which aggravate my asthma/allergies or give me a headache.This  in  shampoo/conditioner has an uplifting scent which is not overpowering.I do have a sensitive/dry scalp which this  in  product did not irritate my scalp at all.I did however need to add a leave in conditioner because this product did not condition my hair enough which is long and  thick but for a man who has less hair they probably wouldn't need to use a separate conditioner.I know this won't pose a problem for my dad because he doesn't have alot of hair.All in all this is a good product.

When I work-out my hair gets sweaty and dirty. I like to have something that will clean as well as take refresh my hair. I also have sensitive scalp that makes my scalp dry and itchy.

My love-hate relationship with most hair heat protectors is due to unpredictable results and different benefits based on brand.  I LOVE that they protect my hair in most cases HATE how they either make your hair feel dry in need of another product for moisture OR have an oily shine that attracts all kinds of dust and pollution requiring daily washing and another round of hot tools. This product has a neutral fragrance that doesn't clash with perfumes comes in a nice spritz bottle with a good nozzle and product doesn't cause nozzle clogs.My go-to heat protector isTRESemme European Instant Heat Tamer Styling Spray -Ounce Bottles (Pack of )and I couldn't wait to try this one. Tresemme Platinum works very well in conjunction with the Platinum Shampoo & Conditioner which makes your hair soft smooth and moisturized. You just have to use a lower than usual temperature setting on your flat iron because your hair will need less heat to straighten it. Too much heat and your hair will be smooth shiny but feel a little too straight without body.When used with other brand shampoos & conditioners the results can be a bit sketchy either an oily mess or a bit dry depending on different brand products. This bothered me because I can use my Tresemme Heat Tamer with ANY shampoo and conditioner regardless of brand and have consistent results. Thus far I like my Tresemme old standby better.I'll continue to use the Platinum Heat Protector only with Platinum shampoo and conditioner. I only gave it  Stars because I don't like being locked into a brand or line. I travel for work projects of varying duration. TSA liquid restrictions cramp my style. I need the flexibility to use what's available. What may start out as a week long project can turn into a month long project of long hours and using available hotel shampoo & conditioner.PS Packing EMPTY heat protectant bottle + travel size bottle filled with heat tamer is how I roll. FYI most data centers are out in the boonies and the weird hours are not conducive to gallivanting and/or SHOPPING! Good With It's Platinum Line Products,Neutral
I am not a big fan of hair products in general. Partly because most of them are too heavily perfumed and partly because of expense. The other factor is that I'm a low maintenance person when it comes to hair. I want it to look nice and I pay every  weeks or so for professional color and highlighting. But for most of my adult life I wear my hair washed and dried and that's about it. Curling styling and spraying it into a helmet shape is just too much work.Having said that I have recently grown bored with my always-the-same hair and decided to venture into some low-key products. I live in a humid climate which is fabulous for naturally wavy hair that I usually blow dry mostly strait. Read: frizz galore. To cure the problem I've tried an obscene number of different hair conditioners promising to solve my problem. When most fell short of controlling my frizz I turned to smoothers gels and mousses to try and contain my wild strands. I had all but given up and decided to just let it be wild and stop taming it entirely. Until I tried this heat spray.I washed conditioned and towel dried as I always do. Same hair products I use every day. But Before I blow dried my hair I sprayed a light mist of the Platinum Strength spray over the surface of my hair then proceeded to dry as I normally do.Much to my amazement it actually did the trick. Unlike mousse my hair wasn't sticky. Unlike gel it wasn't heavy. Unlike holding spray it wasn't stiff. And unlike cream conditioners or smoothing serums it didn't make my hair flat. It was actually perfect. My color-treated mid-length hair had hold lift bounce and NO frizzies. The only other thing I noticed is that it takes a slight edge off of my natural shine but not a great deal of it. The final pro is that it is NOT heavily perfumed at all. I don't feel like I have a cloud of cheap perfume wafting through the air behind me.This is definitely a keeper. Surprised and Impressed. Better than mousse.,Neutral
After using this a few times there may be something to using it with its suggested companions the shampoo and conditioner.Aside from that it worked well enough. My hair does come out pretty smooth although a tad bit oily and harder to manipulate. Perhaps because of this it makes it difficult to curl my hair with a straightening iron (my usual style). I get creases which I then have a iron out. These combined took off one star as it wasn't a very big problem for me. More of a minor annoyance. I'm not sure if using its buddies would help cut down on that at all.I used both when my hair was wet and when it was dry. It works just the same either way but if you use it on dry hair use less. Always comb through. The nozzle sprays in very localized areas so hold it away from your head.I will say my hair has been shinier since using this and the smell of it ins't strong so it doesn't interfere with my perfume. I can say that I will recommend this product to other people as it is affordable and does work. Useful,Neutral
The scent of this shampoo is such a heavy perfume that it actually makes me want to sneeze (something I prefer NOT to do in the shower).  I'm not impressed by how it leaves my hair either - I mean it seems to be okay but nothing special and Nexxus is too expensive for that to be acceptable. Heavily perfumed,Neutral
I have an early morning so hair products that uncomplicate my life are a must.  Therefore I am pleased to report that this shampoo andNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner . Ounceused together resulted in pleasantly managable hair with good bounce.I also used theNexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray . Ounceand blew my normally wavy hair straight after using this conditioner.  The results were (surprisingly) straight hair that didn't need a flat iron.  I am Really Very Happy with how managably my hair straightened.I am very happy with the results but so far I am slightly disappointed that this product didn't leave my hair as shy as I had hoped.  (Not so disappointed that I am willing to dock it a star I just had hoped for more shine.)SMELLS DIVINE!  All of the Nexxus products I have tried have had some degree of a feminine girly scent.  The scent of this line has been my favorite.  It's a very fruity perfume that reminds me a body spray.  Perhaps it would irritate those with extreme perfume allergies?  There does seem to be a higher concentration of perfume in the shampoo and conditioner than in the Blow Out spray. LOVE the fruity perfumed scent!  Results=Managable Hair.,Neutral
I've been using Head&shoulders for years which I really like. THis Nexxus shampoo is pretty good but I still prefer my Head&shoulders. The Nexxus is quite easy to wash off which is nice. However right after the shower when my hairs are still wet I feel like the shampoo glues them together. I can't comb my hair with my fingers (I have no such problem with the Head&shoulders). However later when my hairs are completely dry they become smooth and soft. The feeling is better than the Head&shoulders. So right after the shower the Nexxus shampoo is terrible. However an hour after that the feeling is quite nice. By the way this shampoo is for woman only. If you walk into Macy's cosmetic department (where they sell lotions make-ups perfumes etc) you will notice that womanly smell of the products. This conditioner has the same smell which is not for men. It's okay.,Neutral
I have both the shampoo and conditioner and have been using them together for a couple of weeks now.Things I look for in hair productsScent:  I like things as mild smelling as possible and unfortunately this product is extremely perfumey.  That takes it down a star for me.  The scent does linger after the hair is dry.Lather: (shampoo) VERY good lather on the shampoo.  Feels great.Tangles:  (conditioner) conditioner really gets the tangles outLook and Feel:  My hair looks and feels great.  It's healthy and shiny.The products purport to combat:Eight signs of aging hair include: volume loss breakage less shine roughness dryness brittleness unruliness and loss of color vibrancyI can't answer to breakage or volume loss or even color vibrancy - because my color fades over time but I can say that I'm satisfied with the performance on the other items.Recommended if strong smelling hair products don't bother you. Shampoo and Conditioner,Neutral
I really like this shampoo it works really well. There is a light scent almost like cocoa butter but once I blew dried my hair there was really any scent so it will not interferer with any perfume that you might wear or if you simply don't want your hair having a strong fragrance. It left my hair feeling clean with no residue. I also usedNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner . Ounce which is the companion conditioner. They really work well together. Very nice shampoo doesa nice jo,Neutral
It's hard to know for sure exactly what a shampoo is doing for your hair because the conditioner you use has more effect on the final look and feel of your hairstyle. This shampoo lathers up nicely and it gets my hair squeaky clean with only one washing. No need to rinse and repeat. So even though it's expensive I'm using half the amount I use with cheaper shampoos that require two washings. I may even be using less than half because this gets such a good lather that I only need to use a small amount. What this means is that I'll go through the shampoo and conditioner at about the same rate. Usually I run out of shampoo way before I use up its matching conditioner.This shampoo smells very pretty sort of like a combination of candy and perfume but it's way too strong. Fortunately I haven't had a bad reaction to the fragrance as I sometimes do but it needs to be dialed down considerably. Granted my nose is more sensitive than most people's but I think even average sniffers might find this a bit too heavily perfumed. Cleans Efficiently. Smells Pretty But Fragrance Is Too Strong.,Neutral
TRESemm&eacute; Platinum Strength Deep Conditioning Treatment is a good choice for occasional treatment of damaged dry hair.  It has a moderate floral perfume and rinses well for a deep conditioner leaving the hair smooth and shiny and with good body.  It is not necessary to use a lot but it needs to be worked through the hair carefully with the fingers or a comb making sure to coat the tips. Deep conditioner for damaged hair,Neutral
I've been using this for about a week.  I have longer than shoulder length hair.  You simply spray this product on towel dried hair prior to using your blow dryer.  I have baby fine hair and lots of it.  I find that this spray seems to make my hair stronger and I've been noticing that less and less of it is coming out on my wide tooth comb.  I like to comb my damp hair prior to blow drying because if you part your hair and then blow dry the part is heat set.  I've noticed that after I spray this product on my damp hair less hair is getting snarled and tangeled into my comb.  The product doesn't seem to have any smell whatsoever and this was a bit dissapointing to me because the elixir in this same product line smells heavenly.As for plump and lift...I haven't noticed my hair being any different from this product. It dries less snarly and frizzy but I have noticed no plump or lift.  Again dissapointing because the elixir is amazeballs.  Overall my hair is amazing using these two products together and I'm a bit fearful to stop using this one because my hair is no longer falling out and I know it's because of this spray....it didn't stop with usage of the elixir.Nexxus...please make this stuff smell yummy like the elixir!  Pretty please!!! I also would love hair perfume with this smell.  Why don't companies sell hair perfume? I would buy it.The bottle and pump design on this product is perfect. The tapered bottle again perfect.  I'm losing less hair yup this is not what this product is for but I'm going to keep using it.  Perhaps the plump and lift is from having more hair? almost love this product....no plump or lift?,Neutral
Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray has been a pleasant surprise.  After trying many volumizing products with less than stellar results it has been satisfying to find one that does not make my hair and scalp feel itchy and stiff.  Pleasant fragrance does not interfere with perfume.  Goes on easily with the pump spray and dries beautifully. Great volume without feeling stiff,Neutral
I used this Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray after shampooing and conditioning withNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo . OunceandNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner . Ounce.  I am very pleased with all three products.On SCENT:  All three products have the same matching scent.  It's a very sweet very fruity slightly floral perfumed scent.  It rather reminds me of a body spray.  The scent is stronger in the shampoo and conditioner (where it IS rather strong!) than in this spray (where the scent is much much lighter).  I adore the scent!  And I like the slight perfumed scent that the three together leave on my hair.  However those with extreme scent related allergies may wish to exercise some caution.And now about the HAIR:  My hair is naturally very wavy (slightly curly) and it tends to resist straightening and does sometimes come out unmanagable or (sadly) frizzy when straightened.  However I am QUITE happy with the results following this application.  It's managable soft bouncy light-weight and not frizzy.  It's also straight--without the need for a straightening iron.One area of disappointment: I was disappointed there was not more increase in shine.Overall: Five stars! Smells yummy!  Results are in: Managably Straightened Hair with Nice Body.,Neutral
I have long hair and it often looks flat at the roots. Blow-drying in the winter only dries it out and makes my hair cling to my head with static. Hairspray helps with the clinging but it weighs my hair down and makes it look flatter.When I found out about this product I was skeptical. How could adding a product make your hair feel lighter? But it really does! Nexxus Youth Renewal fluffs my hair up without weighing it down and keeps it from clinging to my face and clothes. The smell isn't strong so it doesn't clash with my perfume. It is easy to use and it delivers on its promise.Do not spray this on dry hair though because it will feel stiff. Great for Dry Winter Hair,Neutral
If I blow dry my hair without any product it gets fly-away and my forelock ends up separated from the rest of my hair and falls down into my eyes.  Therefore I have tried a large variety of hair products that will give me some hold and tame my forelock.  I was dubious about this because I've found that sprays may give me some body but I can't get the tame I need from anything other than mousse.  Right now I am using a Nexxus mousse that is just right - not too heavy but keeps my hair in line right up til bedtime.Imagine my surprise when this spray gave me results that were similar but different from any other product I've used.  I had just gotten a ridiculously expensive haircut from the founder of the salon I go to (my stylist broke her ankle) and it was sassy and bouncy and beautiful that day...and I just couldn't reproduce it after that.  Then I used this and didn't do anything much different (blow dry while using a full round brush) and I got a bouncy sassy Tina Fey-ish 'do.  And it held just like mousse. The only thing I don't care much for is that the scent is a little strong for me I'm very sensitive and anything perfumey is annoying.But it's worth it! Hello sassy and bouncy!,Neutral
I used this product on just blow-dried hair.  I was a little afraid it might make my hair greasy or dirty looking.  Nope none of that to worry about here.  This product comes in a pretty pinkish/purple bottle with an eyedropper type of applicator.  The smell is so yum I could wear it as perfume. It's a clean scent but with something a bit special as a side note.  I dropped out the suggest  to  drops and rubbed them into my hands and slicked it down over my hair and wiped my hands clean through my hair.  I proceeded to style as normal but something amazing happened.  My hair came out smooth and shiny and silky.  Like a commercial was being filmed in my own bathroom.  I had to do a double take. I didn't quite believe it myself.  The next morning I expected that perhaps it was just a lucky hoax...but nope for  day's straight now I've had a transformative experience with this product.I am  years old and have color treated hair.  It certainly is not dry like straw but I've begun to lose the oomph and body I had as a younger woman.  This product causes my hair to have a luxurious shine and look immediately healthy.  I'm sold. I want to stock up like a hoader because it seems every time I fall this madly and passionately in love with a product...it dissapears on me far too soon.  This is amazing stuff.  I'm in love.  I don't see or feel it building up on my hair either. It just does something to my hair that is magical. I wish I had this for the past  years.  My hair was losing it's oomph long before I accepted the fact that I'm no longer .I'm rarely a must have person with products...but I already can't imagine doing my hair without this.  Smooth shiny no more frizz and dry looking flyaways.  I use a big fat curling iron to do my hair...and with this product I get the most amazing soft big curls and none of the drying and strawlike tendencies of my middle aged hair.Have I told you it's magical?  It is. love at first try,Neutral
Since I've been using this elixir my hair is shinier and smoother but at $. for . ounce it's just not practical for long hair. I don't know how other people get away with just a few drops as I use several on the roots and several on the ends which has nothing to do with how long my hair is. Then there's the hair in-between which gets several more drops. All told I'm probably using about twelve to fifteen drops. At that rate this bottle won't last very long. There are other less expensive but equally effective products that are available such as the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty line of shampoos and conditioners. I particularly like theClear Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask Ultra Shea  Fluid Ounce.Even though I prefer using unscented products I don't mind using scented products if the scent isn't overwhelming. Unfortunately this product has a strong sweet perfumey smell that I don't like. Even though it dissipates after it's applied to the hair I don't like having to smell it when I open the bottle and when I have it on my hands.Even though this product works between the expense and the scent I can't recommend it. Works well but too expensive especially for long hair.,Neutral
I generally like Dove soaps.  This one has way too much perfume added though.  It's a strong flowery scent that just doesn't appeal to me. Scent is too strong,Neutral
I generally stick with non-perfumed Dove bars but through the Vine program ordered this one. Pleasantly surprised. Nice aroma on opening but not overpowering when used.It's hard to say whether I will move to perfumed Dove bars vs non-perfumed after this trial but I'm more likely to. Perhaps for guests. Very nice.,Neutral
Dove Rebalance is scented with plum & sakura blossom.  Right out of the package it has a distinctive and pleasant odor but does not leave the skin smelling overly perfumed.  Like regular Dove soap it does leave the skin feeling moisturized and provides a nice lather.  For those like me who prefer soap over body wash this is a great choice. My only complaint with Dove soap is that a bar doesn't last very long.  It's not hard milled like some other soaps that I use and dissolves while just sitting in the shower. I like it!,Neutral
I was a bit hesitant about giving this Dove soap a chance. It seems that in the past when I have used Dove products I'm left with a lotiony-oily residue on my skin that I hated. I'm sure the moisturizing is good for my skin but I always hated the greasy feeling.The good news is that Restore does not leave you feeling oily after use.And while I found this a problem others won't but I found the Dove bar's scent way too subtle. No I don't want to walk out of the shower smelling like Macy's perfume counter but I want a strong clean scent when washing up something on the level of an Irish Spring Zest or Lever . A scent that wakes you up when you stumble into the shower in the morning. The Dove has a nice smell but it's very very subtle.I also prefer a soap that produces a rich full lather and I found the Dove Restore lacking in that department as well. I want hands full of suds when cleaning up and the Dove really doesn't provide that. You have to work to get a lather up and even then it's kind of thin.I like the scent and like the non-oily feeling but I want something a bit stronger. Subtle Scent No Oily Residue,Neutral
I never knew my skin could be so soft. Seriously I had never tried Dove because I figured soap was soap. Ever since I started using this Dove bar my skin has been smoother I have less dry skin and my elbows are getting softer. I've had an issue with my elbows ever since I was a teen. Nothing helps for more than an hour or so. I've tried creams lotions ointments butters and even wearing socks over them to get rid of the dry cracking feeling. When I read on the package of this Dove bar moisturizing cream I decided to try it on my elbows. I didn't really believe it would work but it did! My elbows feel softer than they ever have (I still have a ways to go) and they don't hurt anymore. It seems like the soap is filling cracks and mending my skin there. This soap smells nice and since I'm allergic to a lot of perfumes I was happy this one didn't make me sneeze. I Never Knew How Soft My Skin Could Be,dry skin
I love the scent of this soap - neither overtly masculine nor feminine; it has a clean fresh smell that won't make the guys feel like they're wearing perfume.  It has a rich lather that rinses clean - no filmy residue left on the skin.  My skin is on the normal side (not too dry not oily) and it doesn't leave me with that tight overly dry feeling.  Best of all it doesn't irritate my occasionally sensitive skin.Since skin sensitivity and allergies can vary widely from person to person there's no guarantee that your skin won't react.  All I can say is that it worked well for me and it is an item that I would purchase again.  Definitely NOT recommended for those who prefer a fragrance-free product. Love the clean fresh scent,Neutral
Even though some of the new Dove scents are really good this one just doesn't work for me.I am not a fan of heavy flowery perfume smells; and this one is.  It was very strong and I could even continue to smell it after it was rinsed away.I just couldn't use this one and even though I really like Dove this scent just isn't one I can use. Not a Good Scent,Neutral
It's been a while since I got excited about a bar of soap but the Dove beauty bar with the scent of plum and sakura blossom (Japanese cherry) has the most wonderful odor a rich plummy-berry fragrance that develops with a citrusy-lemongrass component with the tiniest hint of spice that would seem absolutely edible except for a slight floral undertone.I am sensitive to some perfumes but not this one not at all.  It makes the whole bathroom smell good but only lingers a bit on the body after rinsing.  It's something new and interesting as I usually stick to lavender or vetiver.This soap also lathers extremely well producing lots of creamy suds.  It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped and noticeably soft and smooth.  After using it in the evening there is still a difference in the way my face feels the next morning soft but not oily.Put some fresh sheets on the bed and a nice fluffy towel in the bathroom and then take a long hot bath or shower using this lovely pale mauve soap and imagine that you are staying in a luxury hotel! Exquisite fragrance copious lather,Neutral
I've purchased Dove's products for many years (bar soap and body wash) because they're always a step above the rest when it comes to nourishing your skin and not drying it out like other soaps and body washes.  This new bar soap with coconut oil is a welcome addition to their line of products - after using in the shower my skin feels clean and refreshed.  I love the scent - it's light and pleasant not overly flowery or perfumed like many soaps.  My husband didn't even mind using this as the scent is fairly neutral and it does not linger on your skin long.  My -year old who has sensitive skin even tried this and liked it and had absolutely no problems using it - coconut oil is a wonderful thing when it comes to skin and moisturizing our bodies.Another great product from Dove will definitely buy more when this runs out! Dove Bar Soap Restore,great product
I don't care for heavily perfumed soaps.  I like light fruity scents.  Other then that it is a basic soap. Heavily Perfumed,Neutral
I love the scent of this soap and will continue to use it for that reason alone.  It also is less drying than many other soaps out there -- but the scent is what makes this brand stand out.  It's not a perfumey smell which I can't stand it's more of a fresh invigorating floral/fruity scent.  I recommend this if you're looking for something a cut above. Smells Fantasti,Neutral
My experience with Dove is that they overly perfume some of their products.  This soap just might be one of them even though it has a nice fresh scent.  It's just that some scents lean toward the annoying and this is borderline in that respect.  Dove soap has long been recommended by dermatologists (including my own) because of its mild formulation and non drying factor.  We all know it's / cleansing cream.  Unfortunately the cream factor is what turns this soap rather mushy over time.  I prefer hard (or French) milled soaps that stay firm throughout their life.This is a nice soap but Dove should turn the fragrance down a notch or two.  Would not recommend for those sensitive to fragrance. Fragrant,Neutral
This Lysol Touch of Foam foaming hand soap is a great product. I love to cook and my kitchen hand soap is a very important part of my routine...you are constantly going back and forth to wash your hands while cooking. Put the chicken on the grill--wash your hands. Time to cut the veggies for the salad--wash your hands. Etc etc. I love this soap. Even with very buttery or oily hands the foamy soap cuts right through without over drying my  year old hands.My only quibble is I do not love this scent creamy vanilla orchid. Has a fake slightly chemical cheap perfume artificial vanilla scent. I'll buy this product but...I'll select a different scent.Recommendation: Yes great product at a good price with antibacterial action. Love the foam the scent is just okay,great product
New Lysol Touch of Foam Antibacterial Hand Wash is not what one might expect! It is obvious that Lysol put a great deal of thought into researching the latest item in its product line and I am excited that BzzAgent gave me an opportunity to try it first by providing me with a free full-sized sample.When I thought Lysol I thought bleach; however the Creamy Vanilla Orchid scent has no underlying odor of bleach which can be unpleasant. While the perfume is decidedly feminine it is not so much so that it deterred my fianc&eacute; from trying or liking it. Other available scents include Rose & Cherry in Bloom and Wild Berry Bliss. Each scent has antimicrobial properties built in to protect the pump and resist odor-causing bacteria. (Additionally I have never seen a purple-colored soap before so I can envision this product fitting in very well with certain decor themes.)With bleach on my mind I also anticipated having very dry skin after I used the Hand Wash. I was pleasantly surprised to find that while it kills .% of germs on contact and offers x more germ protection than the leading competitor its moisture-enriched micro-bubbles leave my hands feeling soft and comfortable after every wash. The soap was not greasy as I expected; on the contrary it foamed so richly that I could see the non-drip lather that allowed me to turn my palm over without the foam falling off!New Lysol Touch of Foam Antibacterial Hand Wash is certainly not what I expected! Because it is soft on skin while still being hard on germs I am still in awe that this product is not from the shelves of a price-inflated bath and body retailer! Not what one might expect!,dry skin
The creamy vanilla orchid scent smells as good (though definitely not as strong) as perfume.  Lysol's new touch of foam hand soap is great for the kitchen or bathroom and since a small amount foams up in your hand you don't use that much at once so it lasts quite a while saving money in your soap budget.  I'd like to try some of the others scents as well. Love the scent,Neutral
I bought this product hoping it would help with my very dry flaky skin. For starters it smells like a heavy perfume. It was extremely overpowering. I used this for a few days and my skin was actually feeling flakier. I read the ingredients and # on the list is denatured alcohol which explains why it was drying out my skin. This is a waste of money and I do not recommend it. I regret buying this,Neutral
This conditioner worked quite well.  I do not have the matching shampoo and used the conditioner with my everyday shampoo.Plus:* creamy even consistency that spread nicely throughout wet hair - much nicer than other conditioners I have used* pleasant fragrance* made my hair very soft and luxurious feeling when wet - surprisingly so* no tangles! when combing wet hair* the feeling of my hair when wet (smooth no tangles) gave the impression that no other styling products would be needed to have nice soft managed hair (but see TBD below)* soft hair when dry lightly shinyMinus:* fragrance maybe a little too strong and lingering* made my skin itchy likely due to too much fragrance (bordering on yellow perfume smell)* high price (but it was complimentary for me for Vine evaluation)Comments:* once my hair dried it sort of frizzed out - it seemed like the majority of my hair was smooth underlying with a fuzzy top surface (different from most conditioners). Use of a leave-in or styling product is likely still necessary* not sure about youth renewal rejuvenating marketing claim - I did not feel my hair looked any younger or rejuvenated whatever than meansOverall decent but I probably will not repurchase since it is fairly high cost and there are other products just as good for less. very good,Neutral
I have tried this Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner alongside another Nexxus productNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner . Ounce.  I found that both worked almost exactly the same for me - they added some body and shine to my hair without leaving my hair greasy or matted down.  I would agree that this is a light conditioner as opposed to what I imagine a heavy conditioner would be - and for my purposes a light conditioner is preferable.  In the shower they both rinsed out well leaving me hair feeling clean.To be honest the only difference I found between the two products was the unnecessary perfume scent added to the Youth Renewal product. For that reason I would choose the Hydralight Weightless Conditioner as my favorite. Then again there are other conditioning products that also work for less money so I'd suggest shopping around a bit. Works OK unneeded scent,Neutral
I have an early morning so hair products that uncomplicate my life are a must.  Therefore I am pleased to report that this shampooNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo . Ounceand Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner used together resulted in pleasantly managable hair with good bounce.I also used theNexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray . Ounceand blew my normally wavy hair straight after using this conditioner.  The results were (surprisingly) straight hair that didn't need a flat iron.  I am Really Very Happy with how managably my hair straightened.I am very happy with the results but so far I am slightly disappointed that this product didn't leave my hair as shy as I had hoped.

I use this conditioner with the recommended shampoo (the Nexxus Rejuvenating Shampoo) and the results are not very impressive. Right after I wash the conditioner off my hairs still a little rigid. I feel likie they are somewhat glued together. I feel quite a lot of friction when I try to comb my hair with my fingers. However an hour after the shower when my hairs are completely dry the feeling is quite nice. My hairs are soft and smooth. By the way this conditioner is for woman only. If you walk into Macy's cosmetic department (where they sell lotions make-ups perfumes etc) you will notice that womanly smell of the product. This conditioner has the same smell which is not for men. It's okay.,Neutral
I don't know how to rate this fairly. Its performance as a conditioner deserves five stars but it's very heavily perfumed and that perfume smell stays strong in my hair even into the next day. It's not an unpleasant fragrance and it wouldn't be so bad if it would become more faint after I dry my hair.The good news is that I love what this conditioner does not only for my hair but for my scalp too. I have a lot of hair but it's very fine and quite dry even though I don't get perms or use a lot of heat for styling. This conditioner leaves me with no dry fly-away pieces and it doesn't weigh my hair down at all. It stays full and bouncy.The unexpected benefit is what this does for my dry scalp. I don't have dandruff. Just a very dry scalp. After only one use there was a huge difference in my scalp. The flakiness was almost completely gone. One little tip: The directions say to comb the conditioner through your hair and then wait three minutes before rinsing. I prefer to massage the conditioner into my scalp and the ends of my hair rather than just combing it through. This may have contributed to the great results with my scalp.So I have mixed feelings about this product. It delivers on its promises but the fragrance is overwhelming. If your sniffer isn't very sensitive or you're after those Gee your hair smells terrific! compliments you might absolutely love it. . stars.

I'm not one to rave about hair care products. I usually just use whatever I can get my hands on that's not too expensive. However I have to say I'm very impressed with the way this product conditions my fine dry hair without weighing it down.I've also tried the Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner which performs well but has an overwhelming and persistent scent. I much prefer this Hydralight Conditioner not only for the way it makes my hair feel but also because the fragrance is subtle. To me it smells almost like the Halston perfume I used to love back in the 's but less perfume-y. This is a scent that's perfect for both men and women. It's neither girly nor manly.This is salon quality so it's definitely pricey but I highly recommend it for those who can afford it. This stuff has made a difference not only for my hair but also for combating very dry scalp which was a benefit I wasn't expecting. I like to massage it into my scalp during the minute or two you're supposed to wait before rinsing out the conditioner. Superb Lightweight Conditioner With A Wonderfully Subtle Fragrance.,Neutral
PROS- Feels luxuriously creamy and packed with moisture yet after I wash it out and dry my hair it doesn't weigh my hair down. I get lots of body.- I'm able to brush through my hair just fine which I can't say about the other conditioners I've been using- The owner of my hairstyling salon said I must have been blow drying my hair less as it seemed less dryCONS- I can't stand the smell when I put it on in the shower.  The smell goes away after my hair dries but for me it is unpleasant while on.  Not sure how to describe it it's not like perfume but more like chemicals. I like how my hair looks just not how it smells while in the shower,Neutral
Recommend!  As Goldilocks would say this product is just right for hair that loves moisture but weighs down easily.My hair is more or less perfectly programmed to drive me nuts.  :)  Hairstylist's tend to like my hair texture more than I do (maybe they are just good actors lol).  I have medium/long (just above my bra strap) brown hair.  In terms of number of strands it's thick but the strands are fine.  It's somewhere between curly and wavy in shape; to loose to be truly curly too tight to be just wavy.  Basically it's born for unruliness.  Heavy product kills my curl/wave yet even then it's a bear to straighten.  And I have to have good conditioners to keep the frizz and tangles at bay.My curls/waves need conditioner but heavy product weighs them down.  I actually curl best with minimal product because of the weight issue.  So THIS conditioner was practically MADE for me!  I snagged it for free via the ever-lovable Amazon Vine but I will DEFINATELY be purchasing more.  It's so lovely and light-weight.  Yet very very moist.  Left my hair SHINY and frizz free!I washed and conditioned as usual (with Joico KPak which I ALWAYS go back to and highly recommend).  Applied this conditioner and a bit of mousse (mostly roots) and allowed to air dry overnight (I avoid the hair-dryer unless I'm straightening).  The next morning I was delighted with my shiny spring-y curl.  Totally light-weight!FEEL: In the hand it feels very moist light a moisturizing foam just short of oily.  Very rich feel.SMELL: Pretty light but almost edible perfumed smell. Not overwhelming or chemically but there is a definate smell to this product. Left my hair light and shiny.  Quite Pleased.,Neutral
I am going to be honest. I don't buy into salon products and spending a bunch of money on shampoos. (I did a th grade science experiment with the class where we tested various shampoos and the end result was they all basically work the same!) However I use a lot of hair product and sometimes after using the same shampoo for months it doesn't strip away the build up as easy. Well I'm glad I tried Nexxus out. First the fragance is neutral so I don't have to worry about my shampoo competing with my perfume. Second it is weightless and a little goes such a long way. I've had it for over  days and have well over half the bottle left . (Just as a reference I have waist length hair). Worth the money,long way
If only every pretty book cover had a wonderful book inside. Nexxus Hydra-light shampoo has one of the prettiest best designed bottles I've seen in a long time. The top is thin and perfect for smaller hands to pick it up. The blue color is a little bit of sky blue heaven in the bathroom. Ah but that color gives away a little fault in the beauty there is a little bit of gray skies in there.Sitting on the shelf this would be the perfect impulse buy. Ah if only the shampoo were as beautiful as the bottle. The bottle says weightless moisture. I would expect that to make my hair soft and full of... moisture. Instead it sucked all the moisture right out of my hair making it hard to style. I have thick hair and this did me no favors. The smell might work for some; it is a bit too fruity for my taste. Kind of smells like the perfume people that use a pole wear. Not a sophisticated smell.Too bad the bottle held so much promise. If only the contents were as beautiful as the cover. Just a Pretty Face,little bit
Nexus says it's weightless moisturizer shampoo will Keep(s) hair feeling fresh revived and voluminous without added weight. And does it? Uh no at least not in my case.Shampoos can vary and so long as it scrubs up and such it is doing its job but that having been said you can get one for a lot less than the $+ price tag this carries to do the same work. After using it a few times my hair was not particularly voluminous in fact it seemed limper and flatter than normal and the shampoo itself was the only thing I'd changed from my usual routine.Add to that my wife said that my hair had a scent of cedar after using this. Luckily she likes cedar but I don't think you want a shampoo to `surprise' you by added its own scent to whatever you are planning without letting you know it is doing it.So over all it did lather up and it did clean my hair but it added its own perfume to the proceedings and it certainly seemed to fail at its promise to add volume and revivification to my hair. Add to that the higher price tag compared to other shampoos that will perform at this level for less and I have to say give this a pass. Fails to deliver on hype-over priced for what it does do,Neutral
This is good stuff. My baby fine hair is like a souffl&eacute;: it can look reasonably voluminous so long as it is not weighed down with oil or product or overly manipulated but it will flyaway and fall flat if it is over-washed. This shampoo hits the sweet spot. It cleans well without over stripping. It also smells nice like a sweet grapefruit not like rotting floral fruit like so many others. The scent is nice while I am shampooing but does not linger to clash with my perfume or even just my mood! The lather is nice and plentiful which is fun though not indicative of cleansing power. A little goes a long wayGood stuff! Nice scent that doesn't linger or clash and cleans well with rich lather,Neutral
I was introduced to the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam . OunceNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam . Ouncea few weeks ago and the result was love. Based on that experience I was delighted to try the Shampoo and Conditioner from this weightless product line.The results are LOVE.I highly recommend this to anyone with similar hair texture to my own. I have Very Wavy/Modestly Curly hair (some would consider it a B curl pattern). In terms of number of hair strands my hair is thick---but individual hair is fine. My hair is also rather long. Hence its prone to being weighed down by product---particularly when worn wavy/curly and/or air dried (as opposed to being blown out straight). These products are INCREDIBLE for my curly days!!!!! They leave my hair bouyant and even cutlier than usual---all without so much as a curl gel.Love it for lightweight curly days!!!!!I will note that the Shampoo and Conditioner contain the same pretty floral/somewhat perfumed scent as the foam.  However the scent of the conditioner and shampoo is much stronger than the scent of the foam.  I love the scent but it may irritate those with serious perfume alllergies. My CURLS LOVE this product line!!!,Neutral
A little extra shampoo probably twice the amount I should have used flowed out and rather than returning the excess to the bottle I just used it. Lather was everywhere - the quantity quite impressive. My usual shampoo does not contain sulfates so it is low lathering and I had forgotten what a normally formulated shampoo is like.Note that I used the matching Nexxus conditioner after shampooing which the manufacturer recommends. My hair is somewhat long the hair itself is thin in texture and prone to tangling so it is easily weighed down by heavy hair products.In addition to the rich lather the scent is very light and citrusy. It definitely won't linger or conflict with other fragrances like cologne or perfume. It seems like every personal care item out there has its own strong fragrance and even ones claiming to be unscented sometimes aren't (I just used a heavily scented body wash that was labeled as unscented.) So in this regard the product is refreshingly different.After shampooing and conditioning combing my hair was more difficult than usual. My hair was definitely more tangled. I don't know why. After blow drying my hair I noticed it was markedly softer and my usual frizzy spots much more manageable. My hair was definitely not weighed down and may have had slightly more volume.So even though I had to wrestle with more tangled wet hair it was worth it for the improved appearance of my dry hair. Of course whether more tangled wet hair is tolerable is a matter of personal preference. I genuinely like this shampoo and will use it as a clarifying shampoo once a week or so. And the light fragrance is a real plus. Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Shampoo,Neutral
I hadn't used Nexxus products before very recently and I have been pleasantly surprised at how much better they are than other standard consumer shampoos and conditioners. For one thing you can use less of Nexxus shampoo per cleaning because it tends to lather up more efficiently. However as has been my experience with other Nexxus shampoos it doesn't get my scalp as clean as harsher shampoos and I have to shampoo more often. Also this lives up to the claim of moisturizing hair without weighing it down as evidenced by the amount of body and increased volume. This was very surprising for me in particular because my hair is very long and the weight of the hair at the bottom can weigh down that around my scalp. That didn't happen with this. I don't have fine hair but if you do this might be a good choice.Other than the obvious benefits listed above it also has almost no scent. This is actually a big deal to me because I dislike shampoos that smell like perfume. All in all this is a good clean moisturizing shampoo which doesn't weight your hair down with a strong scent or heavy conditioning agents. adds lots of volume and body,Neutral
This stuff smells so good that I use it on my hair to attract my new boyfriend.  It replaces any perfume any day.  He always tells me that I smell pretty and it really turns him on.  I already have really good hair to begin with so I just use it for the scent. Excellent smell,Neutral
There's nothing especially special about this new cleanser from Clearasil. The active ingredient is % salicylic acid which is pretty much the standard acne fighting ingredient besides benzoyl peroxide. Some cleansers are very harsh on the skin but this one actually isn't too bad. I don't think I'd use it twice a day if you have sensitive skin but once a day should be okay. It has a nice fragrance that smells clean but not perfumey. The gel washes off easily so you don't have to worry too much about residue lingering and making your skin worse.OVERALL: this is a solid product from Clearasil. If you're a long-time acne sufferer don't expect it to do miracles but at least it's semi-gentle on the skin and will probably slow down break outs thanks to the salicylic acid. At the affordable price it's worth giving it a shot. Nothing new here but still a good cleanser,sensitive skin
Love these products from Watts..no smelly perfumes to make me sneeze and/or get rhinitis from..just good ingredients to help my skin.  I am seeing a smoothing effect and my scars are not so noticeable now.  Will order a larger size next time. Great stuff.,Neutral
Got this in a sample box and fell in love with it. I usually like more sensual scents (My current fave is Shakira Elixir) but those scents don't fly well at work where I want to project a more professional vibe. I used up all the Heidi Klum Shine as it wasn't too girly too strong or too spicy. I don't care much for the heavier scents like Juicy Couture etc.I don't care much for perfume that smells like food but this one is really great. Yes it has a mandarin orange scent at first but it's followed up with Patchouli (not strong I don't care for a straight patchouli scent) and vanilla with a very light floral afterscent. Once the alcohol mellows you don't really get an orange scent from it. None of these scents is actually one I would wear alone and even mixed it would give me pause but for some reason it all just works.My husband prefers the Clean line of scents and he really liked this one. (I give you all the different scents I use to give you a better idea of where this fits)The truth is I can't describe why it's amazing. Just that it is. It's clean but not like a man's cologne. I have gotten tons of compliments on it since I've started wearing it. Everyone seems to like it.One word of caution my first bottle had a faulty atomizer. Since I was already in love with the scent I was able to transfer it to another atomizer (The atomizer part is glued to the cap but will slide off with a tug. the rest of the cap then screws off) Don't remove it unless you plan not to use the atomizer though I don't think it will work if you do. The second bottle worked just fine but the atomizer does give a lighter veil of fragrance than a typical spray bottle. Love the scent; Atomizer can be tricky,Neutral
This perfume smells really nice but the only thing I'm not happy with is the atomizer....makes it hard to spray at times.  Scent doesn't stay as long as I would like but overall it is a nice perfume Smells yummy!,Neutral
I love the way this smells very beautiful but not overpowering. It is soft almost powdery. It does not give me a headache like some perfumes do Beautiful,Neutral
Nearly every brand of antiperspirant that I've used has caused me some irritation and itching at some point or another.  This Dove product is quite remarkable in that it doesn't bother me at all.  It's a fairly soft stick and goes on easily.  It smells OK although I'm not a huge fan of perfumed deodorants.  It's not overwhelming.  It hasn't marked up my tee shirts or undershirts.It works pretty well as an antiperspirant too.  I don't have any issues with underarm sweat when I'm wearing it.Recommended. It really isn't irritating,Neutral
I picked up two deodorants from Dove recently:  The Cool Silver: Deodorant and the Cool Silver: Anti Perspirant.They're both very good.  I really like the deodorant because of the very modest but masculine scent and the fact that a full day in the company's warehouse with no air condition didn't result in under arm odor-- a drenched dress yes but under arm odor no.This sole-purpose antiperspirant was also effective today after getting there at : in the morning and working straight through in this Miami heat until  pm.This scent is so faint it can pass for perfume-free.  But that would miss how effective it really is. Went On Like Baby Powder!,Neutral
Living in Florida I use plenty of Antiperspirant. I go to the gym and I also like to go running. Feeling clean is always a priority of mine. I have to say that this Dove Antiperspirant is great. It smells good as well as effective. I have to say I was surprised that it really works. From the scent I thought after you work out it would make you smell like sweat and perfume but it did not. I still smelled the fragrance.A little overpowering smell. Has to take awhile to was off. Workouts,Neutral
I got this for my husband who normally uses Old Spice Sport. The bottom line was that it worked in his estimation about the same as any other deodorant he tried and he wouldn't throw it away but he wouldn't buy it again because of the strong lingering smell of cheap cologne.  In all fairness I think his Old Spice isn't the greatest smell either but after a while the smell dissipates. This stuff still smells pretty strong when he crawls in bed at night.On the upside he forgot to put it on one day and he still didn't have B.O.  hours later. So it does work even if you skip a day as they say it will. Works better than average but still smells like perfume.,Neutral
As the title of my review suggests this shampoo both smells and works wonderfully.  The formula is quite thick and rich but it lathers up easily and nicely on the head and rinses clean. I used this shampoo with the matching conditionerTresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner  Ounce and my hair felt amazingly clean and soft.  I'm also loving the scent of fruits with a slight perfume.  The scent isn't an easy one to describe but it is lovely.I'm generally a user of cheap shampoo and conditioner and my hair usually does just fine with that.  Using this shampoo is a pleasure though and this may convince me that there's something in buying more upmarket hair products. Smells great works great,Neutral
I have used this product for a month now. I shampoo twice a week and use a blow drier each time. This shampoo has improved the feel of my hair which was feeling dry and brittle. The shampoo also has a nice soft scent. Its not too perfumed but leaves my hair smelling nice. I like that it is gentle and has keratin. So far I'm pleased and will purchase this product! Hair feels great,Neutral
I've had good experiences with Tresemme products this is no exception.Used with the conditioner and serum this system works to leave hair smooth and moisturized while still having body and bounce. My hair is fine and straight and shows build-up by looking limp and lackluster. After a couple of weeks of using this my hair is the sleek smooth curtain that I like. No fly-aways and it's very shiny.The shampoo is thick and it only takes a small amount. On my hip length hair a dollop the size of a quarter is enough to get my hair clean. It does take a little longer than other shampoo formulas I've tried to rinse out completely. It's a gentle shampoo and so it doesn't leave your hair detergent squeaky it cleans without stripping.It does leave a faint pleasant scent in your hair fairly neutral and it doesn't clash with my perfumes. sleek without being dull or limp,Neutral
I am now a big fan of AXE products.  This is the second one of tried and love it.  Soap comes out of the bottle easily (unlike dove soap) and really leaves you clean smelling without the perfumes of some soaps. Cool Body Soap,Neutral
This conditioner has a nice consistency and I like the way it makes my hair feel... I have very curly hair that tends toward dryness so I need something that helps to sleek and tame it and this does a nice job of that. The only thing I didn't care for is the scent... it smells too much like old lady mall drugstore perfume. Mostly really like it,Neutral
I have to admit I'm impressed by Tresemme's new line of Collections shampoos and conditioners. I've been working my way through them all with coupons I have but I'd yet to try Keratin Smooth. This one is by far my favorite.I have thick wavy/curly hair that frizzes nicely in humidity and in winter we have a pellet stove running all the time so my hair dries out and becomes staticky. I reach a point where I tend to give up getting my hair to do much of anything and just use a clip to put it up all the time. Hands down I had the BEST hair day with Keratin Smooth.I love the smell. It's clean a little citrusy a little apple-y not really overly perfumey just nice and light. I left the conditioner in for a couple of minutes it rinsed out nicely. Then can the real test. After towel drying used my dryer and scrunched it up so that the layers would wave and not a frizz appeared. I used a little gel for hold and it lasted all day. I never had it frizz up and even my daughter said she'd never seen my hair look that good even after a trip to the salon.I'm sold. I went out and bought more bottles of Tresemme shampoo conditioner and the styling products to make sure I have a good stock on hand just in case they discontinue it. It's new so I doubt that will happen but I've had favorite products disappear before so I'm not taking chances. Surprised by How Well It Works,Neutral
I like and use serums on wet damp and dry hair whether I'm wearing my natural curls and waves or when using hot tools for styling alternatives. Some have lots of slip/oily feeling that seals in the moisture on damp hair but can be a wet hair nightmare because you can't tell by feel if you have too much or too little until it's too late and a gooey mess. Then there are others that are just good on dry hair before and after using hot tools.THIS serum is just that for me. ONE pump warmed in the palms of your hands and smoothed through midlength to ends of wet hair OR a small amount to the ends of dry hair works. It definitely kicks up the shine and manageablity and seals in the benefits from the Keratin Smooth Infusion shampoo and conditioner a notch. It's very forgiving in that a little goes a long way and it's difficult to really overdo it. There is a light scent that doesn't clash with my perfumes so I'm good. It really worked best for me when using hot tool styling not as good when air drying my hair or in wash-n-go mode though.Keratin Smooth Infusion works best for me when staying true to it from shampoo conditioners heat protectant to this serum. Results from mixing matching and interchanging brands and even other Tresemme products in my hair care collection = VERY UNPREDICTABLE BOTH a blessing and a curse. Reaching for whatever is in the shower is totally out of the question.I can say Tresemme's Keratin Smooth Infusion line is winning me over as my go-to when I flat-iron my hair hence the  STARS vs a multi-purpose all star meriting  STARS. BEST used with Keratin Smooth Infusion Line!,long way
I have mildly obnoxious hair. Straightening it usually makes it somewhat better although then I have the problem of the ends frizzing out (they aren't dead they're defiant). I thought why not try to give this a chance? And miraculously it worked! I can straighten my hair to no end now or put this in wet and let it curl and either way my hair isn't frizzy all day! That says a lot as I do my hair at am and go to bed around pm or so-It works for at least that long! I'm not as certain about the hr claim they make only because my hair is oily in the morning and decides it wants to go for a bed-head style every morning. Not as attractive as it sounds.I have to admit it works just as well as the very expensive stuff that my salon attempts to sell me. Also the smell isn't very strong so no interference with my perfume. The smell is...not unpleasant. But not amazing-its rather plain as far as smells go.My hair does have a shine after using this although not as amazing as the photoshopped shine. It moves well too not in a stiff and awkward manner (some serums cause my hair to clump and look awkward). It works well on both wet and dry hair although it's easier to put onto wet hair.I certainly will be buying this from now on as it has proved to be the best hair-smoothing serum I've used. Nifty Serum,Neutral
When our local commissary began to carry these make-up remover wipes I decided to give them a try.  I usually only wear mascara but sometimes I add shadow and liner so I like a remover pad to be able to handle either scenario equally well.  Also I love theSimple Cleansing Facial Wipes  Count (Pack of ) and hoped that these wipes would be just as great.They are definitely as great: Not only do they contain Pro-vitamin B and Vitamin E they do NOT contain alcohol oils dyes skin irritants or (most importantly) perfume.  They are well-moistened soft to the touch and do a great job removing eye make-up without having to scrub and potentially damage the delicate skin that surrounds the eyes.Recommended! Wonderful make-up remover!,Neutral
I don't usually use these types of pads everyday I save them for travel. For review purposes though I tried one as soon as they arrived. I have three criteria when evaluating this type of product; Effectiveness Sensitivity issues and IngredientsEffectiveness and Sensitivity both get five stars. I'm not one to use separate cleansers on the face and eyes so I like one that is gentle for eyes yet strong enough to be effective. I find that if a product will get stubborn eye makeup off it usually works on the face as well and this was no exception.I did get these for free in exchange for my honest review and I will use them for travel. But when they are gone I will not purchase more. The reason for this is the ingredient list. I try to stay away from propylparaben or any ingredient beginning with propyl. On the front of the package it says  vitamins no alcohol no oil and no artificial perfumes or dyes. So on the surface this appears to be a fairly natural product... but it is not up to my standards. There are too many other quality products to choose from nowadays to settle.I was unsure whether to give  or  stars so I rounded up and gave . The pads do work well and they do not bother my eyes. Just be aware though that the color green on the package and the little blades of grass on the label do not guarantee a product with % truly healthy ingredients. Great for Eyes and Face,Neutral
Simple Brand from the UK has been around for  years yet is relatively new to the United States. There are no dyes perfumes and all the products are perfect for sensitive skin. I've used the facial wash exfoliating wipes scrub and toner and all have left my face feeling clean and fresh with a healthy glow and no breakout side effects.However the Eye Make-up Remover Pads are just not effective for removing eye-makeup. In particular it doesn't remove mascara affectively at all. In addition the pads are abrasive in texture which is a major No-No when it comes to cleaning the delicate area around the eye. I find theSimple Cleansing Facial Wipes  Count (Pack of )to be very effective in removing even heavy eye-makeup so there's no need to add a step to your cleaning regime. I will continue to use Simple skin products just not the remover pads. A Simple Miss,sensitive skin
Simple Oil Balancing Wipes is a great way to refresh your face after a long tiring day or just working out.  Great to throw in a gym or tote bag.  I really enjoy the entire line of Simple products because they use simple ingredients - no perfumes dyes or harsh chemicals to irritate your skin. Great for removing makeup and does not bother my eyes.  Leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean without making it feel dry and tight. Great for a quick refresher,Neutral
Unbeknownst to me (until about a month ago) the Simple Company has been around since the early s. It's a UK company which I already knew because I used to go to London frequently where I would buy interesting products to bring back home. I was really excited when Simple products became available in the US at Target and CVS and are now practically everywhere including Amazon.In the past I've used the gel cleanser moisturizing face wash moisturizers cleansing wipes and facial scrub. I was very excited to see the oil balancing wipes even though I don't generally have oily skin but I do get flare ups in the brutally hot weather known as the New York City summer.Simple products have no perfume or artificial color and that's why they're a successful brand because they cater to the millions of people who suffer from skin sensitivity from all that extra stuff you don't really need in a face wash or facial care product.The oil-balancing wipes unlike the cleansing wipes aren't as moist. They're damp but not wet. I think that might be because they have just enough moisture to remove grime but are dry enough to absorb oil and sweat on the skin.  Even though these are fragrance-free they still have a nice clean natural scent probably just from the ingredients.I've been using these for the last several days late in the afternoon at work where the temperature has been uneven - a little too hot - and they give my skin a nice freshened look and then I do a quick touch up with mineral powder and I'm like new again.I really love Simple products and the company's philosophy. And on top of that the prices are unbelievable no matter where you buy them. You get really high quality products for a very reasonable price. When I was unemployed I relied on these products and moved away from any last remnants of purchasing Prestige items at department stores. And guess what these (and the many other reasonably priced quality products out there these days) are just as good if not better than the Prestige brands. The ingredients are better and you get more per pack than many of the high end brands. Simple yes and do what they claim to,Neutral
These wipes are soft and gentle on the skin. I like that they contain no alcohol and no perfumes. They have almost no scent to them at all.They cleanse the skin well.

I keep a pack in my car so that it is handy. gentle and refreshing,Neutral
To set the context for my review I have sensitive dry skin that is also acne prone.  (What a lovely combination!)  And my skin is also made all the more sensitive by prescription meds for the acne.  Because of this I always seek out the most gentle facial products I can buy and take care that they are oil free and won't cause my acne to flare up.  Typically that has meant I have used facial washes from the dermatologist's office orAveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser . Ounce.  The Simple brand has intrigued to me from day one because of the claims of simplicity and gentleness.  I've already tried one of their lotions and was not a fan but figured I'd give them a second try with these wipes.Thankfully I was more satisfied with these than I was with the lotion.  Despite other reviews that the wipes are dry I actually found mind to be perfectly moist.  I was able to clean my entire face without needing to wet the cloth.  I also liked that even without rinsing afterwards (this wasn't mentioned on the packaging so I'm hoping I don't have to) I didn't notice a residue on my skin.  These also have a fairly neutral scent due to the fact there are no added perfumes.That said while these are good for general face cleaning I wouldn't use them for removing eye make up at least not if you have very sensitive skin.  The packaging said eye safe and I will agree that my eyes themselves did not sting while using it.  But it did make the skin under my eyes feel very tender and irritated while using this product.  Thankfully this tends to go away a little while after I've used it.  But I've found using a dedicated eye make up remover with a cotton round to be much gentler on this area.  That said it did do a very good job removing the eye makeup so you may find it okay for this purpose if you have normal skin.I also will mention that while I think this works well I wouldn't say it works better than the Aveeno cleanser I'm already using.  Both seem relatively equal when it comes to their ability to clean my skin without irritating it or making it feel tight.  I intend to continue to useAveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser . Ounceas my day to day cleaner because I think it is more affordable as a day to day cleanser since it lasts me longer.  (Washing my face twice a day I would go through a pack of these in less than  weeks whereas I can get by using a bottle of cleanser for at least two months.  The same thing is true of the Aveeno cleaning pads and that is why I choose to use one of their liquid cleansers over the pads.)  However I can see them being very handy for traveling due to carry on liquid rules and also plan to keep a pack at my desk.  I think they are especially handy for the latter because there are sometimes I want to remove my makeup and reapply before going out after work and this is MUCH more convenient than storing a bottle of cleanser and a wash cloth there.  I could also see them being great for toting to the gym because when I go there the fewer things I have to lug the better!Overall I think these are pretty solid wipes for someone who wants a convenient facial cleaning solution sensitive skin as long as they're careful around the eyes. Good for sensitive skin but does irritate the skin under the eyes,dry skin
I can't quite identify the scent that these wipes have but I like it.  It is fresh but not overpowering.  The package says no artificial perfumes or dyes so I don't know what ingredient(s) cause the fresh smell.More importantly they do a good job of cleansing what they were meant to do.  There is enough liquid in the package that they don't seem dry and rough as some brands of wipes do.  And they are generously sized.  One wipe does a great job of cleansing my face and neck.They are supposed to be oil balancing and for sensitive skin.  They do seem nice and gentle while still being effective and there is no alcohol in them a definite plus.The package has a paper or plastic flap that reseals the package and it holds up just fine doesn't dry out part way through the package.  (I suppose it would if it were opened and kept for months but for general frequent use there have been no problems.)I like the smell and I like the job these wipes do -- what more could I ask for? Smells Nice Does a Great Jo,sensitive skin
When I first got these I thought they were meant to be for washing my face at the end of the day much like the packages of dry facial cloths that suds up when you wet them.  But these are moist in the package and don't feel like they are full of cleanser (at least not what I expected cleanser to feel like) so I was not sure I liked them very much.Then I went to the gym and had an elliptical trainer workout that left my face feeling sweaty.  That gave me a eureka moment on how best to use these wipes.  Put them in your gym bag to wipe your face after your workout.  It feels refreshing and your face will feel clean.  If oily skin during the day is a problem keep a package in your desk (though you'll probably also need to keep makeup there too so you can reapply after wiping your face).I am sensitive to perfumes and these do not have any artificial fragrance added though they do contain lavender oil and another flower oil.  They didn't seem perfume-y to me. Put these in your gym bag!,Neutral
The first thing that I noticed when I opened the package of Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes was the mild perfume of a cleanser which I was unaccustomed to after using three of the brand's other products. While it was not unpleasant the scent lingered for nearly half an hour after washing my face. This particular cleansing wipe left my face feeling clean and smooth in the areas that are not prone to being oily but sticky across my nose and along my jaw line. Fearing that I had been careless when washing my face I repeated the process with the same result. Although the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes did not leave my skin looking as red and feeling as irritated as it does when I have used a harsher cleanser I do not believe that my face is as clean after using this product. I am glad that I had success with Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes and will use them in the future. Thank you Simple! (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)

Compared to Simple Oil Balancing Wipes these are much more &#;abrasive&#; since they have a quilted like design. I have combination skin and have that horrible T-zone problem that causes me to have blackheads around my nose. The wipes are not overly wet they actually feel just damp. As you go over our face you might think to yourself it is not doing anything but you will be amazed how dirty the wipe will be when you look at it. It goes deep into your pores to remove deep down dirt and impurities.Leaves my face feeling clean refreshed and glowing. It did not leave a dry or &#;tightening&#; feeling behind. No perfumes or harsh chemicals - just simply simple. Simply works great,Neutral
Simple Exfoliating Facial Wipes.  I love washing my face.  I love that clean refreshing tingling feel that face-washing brings.  I love washing my face in the mornings.  I love washing my face and removing makeup in the evenings.I tested these wipes and I love them.  They are thick (especially compared to some other brands) and they also have a texture (some brands are smooth).  I prefer the thickness and the texture to the thinness and the smoothness.  The texture gives a slight more tingle.  The thickness just feels better and is easier to handle on your face.I use these at home but they would be perfect for travel.  Next time I travel I will make sure I have some in my bag.These wipes have vital vitamins skin-loving nutrients and no perfumes and no dyes per the package.Highly recommended if you are like me and like to wash your face and also if you are traveling.

These facial wipes are made with a very soft cloth. They have no added perfumes but do have a very very subtle scent to them.They cleanse well. They don't dry out my skin. I like the convenience of facial cleansing wipes and this one is one of my favorites.

There is a bit more texture to the wipe which I am guessing is the 'exfoliation' but if that's what it is referring to calling it exfoliating seems like a bit of a stretch.  At least for me when something is exfoliating I expect a bit of particulate that sloughs off dry skin.  This didn't have that or if it did it is much less noticeable than other exfoliation products I've used.  Still I like these for general face cleaning but if you're in need of some serious exfoliation I'd use a scrub instead.  (Lush Ocean Salt is my absolute favorite and has been perfect for my face and body.)That said while these are good for general face cleaning I wouldn't use them for removing eye make up at least not if you have very sensitive skin.  The packaging said eye safe and I will agree that my eyes themselves did not sting while using it.  But it did make the skin under my eyes feel very tender and irritated while using this product.  Thankfully this tends to go away a little while after I've used it.  But I've found using a dedicated eye make up remover with a cotton round to be much gentler on this area.  That said it did do a very good job removing the eye makeup so you may find it okay for this purpose if you have normal skin.I also will mention that while I think this works well I wouldn't say it works better than the Aveeno cleanser I'm already using.  Both seem relatively equal when it comes to their ability to clean my skin without irritating it or making it feel tight.  I intend to continue to useAveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser . Ounceas my day to day cleaner because I think it is more affordable as a day to day cleanser since it lasts me longer.  (Washing my face twice a day I would go through a pack of these in less than  weeks whereas I can get by using a bottle of cleanser for at least two months.  The same thing is true of the Aveeno cleaning pads and that is why I choose to use one of their liquid cleansers over the pads.)  However I can see them being very handy for traveling due to carry on liquid rules and also plan to keep a pack at my desk.  I think they are especially handy for the latter because there are sometimes I want to remove my makeup and reapply before going out after work and this is MUCH more convenient than storing a bottle of cleanser and a wash cloth there.  I could also see them being great for toting to the gym because when I go there the fewer things I have to lug the better!Overall I think these are pretty solid wipes for someone who wants a convenient facial cleaning solution sensitive skin as long as they're careful around the eyes. Not sure what makes these exfoliating but otherwise they're lovely,dry skin
I love the Simple brand. I have super sensitive skin and I have psoriasis. Also my nose is sensitive to strong smells. I love these products because they work well and do not irritate my skin or my nose. They also have  a pleasant natural smell. Not like some other face wipes that have so much perfume it gives me an instant headache. Simple Radiant face wipes,sensitive skin
I was surprised how much I like these wipes.  I know they cleanse well because they took off my waterproof mascara without any problem.  Yet even though I rubbed them repeatedly at my lashline they did not make my eyes sting nor did they make my contacts blurry.  And then I was surprised how nice my skin felt afterwards.  It wasn't at all dry and tight; in fact I skipped moisturizing which I have never been able to do with any other brand of wash or wipe. At first my skin felt kind of coarse but later after it had thoroughly dried it was noticeably smoother than usual.My only complaints would be that these are kind of expensive (though not out of line with other name-brand wipes) and I don't like the smell.  The smell isn't unpleasant but a very light pleasant scent would have been nice.  However I know the manufacturer avoided perfumes to eliminate any unnecessary sources of irritation.  And since my skin gets red and blotchy at the least provocation but did not with these wipes I appreciate that judgment call.Another drawback is that the wipes left enough of a film that my nose strip did not cling as well as usual.  On subsequent nights I quickly rinsed my nose with plain water and then the nose strips were fine.  And note that the film eventually is no longer noticeable.  I can't stand the feel of gunk on my face but I was happy with how my skin felt once it dried.I would feel guilty about using these every day (especially when I'm not wearing makeup) but I do prefer them to anything else I've ever tried.  Since the wipes are large I will probably cut them in half or even into quarters (something I've done before with other face wipes). Removes mascara easily yet is contact friendly,Neutral
Full disclosure: I don't wear a lot of heavy makeup so your mileage may vary.There are just times after a long day that I don't want to lather up and rinse off so these facial wipes are just perfect for me. The wipes come in a handy packet with a sticky tab to pull up grab a wipe and seal back up. Just give the face a good rub with the wipe and everything is off (at least for me). Extra pluses for no product odor (I'm sensitive to strong perfumes) and for not drying the skin out. These would be very handy for someone traveling and/or in the back country and the packet is small and light for easy packing. I like these,Neutral
I have never been as pleased with a facial cleanser as I was when I tried Simple brand products by Unilever. I have sensitive combination-oily skin so I was skeptical when I chose Radiance Cleansing Wipes after an intense afternoon of spring cleaning; there was no way that my skin would feel clean and look bright without a terry-cloth wash cloth and a harsh cleanser was there? Yes! The oil sweat and grime disappeared and I was instantly invigorated by the face that smiled back at me in the mirror. Radiance Cleansing Wipes left my skin feeling clean and hydrated without feeling greasy or smelling of an artificial perfume. Thank you Simple!

A very unique nice new scent from Axe. This body wash has a wonderful scent that's rather hard to describe but it quite nice as it leaves you smelling very fresh and not overly perfumed as many other Axe scents do. Though their ad campaign about this helping you get the girls is a bit over the top I do think Axe body wash and shampoos are quality products and this one is no exception. This one is recommended to those looking for the softer side of Axe. A Great New Scent from Axe,Neutral
I have tried about every Axe shower gel.  Most are at least decent.  This one I would rate near the best but I wouldn't call it my all time favorite.It is thick and rich and concentrated and luxurious.  Much better than average.  It is a pearly white gel and has little white scrubbing beads in it.  It says Chill Out and Deep Space so I was expecting something more of a minty cool smell like some others that I've used.  It is not minty cool at all.  It is hard to explain.  It is unique.  Imagine you just stepped inside an igloo.  It has a sort of frosty smell to it but in a very pleasant refreshing almost perfumery sort of way.  I guess it does smell like whatever deep space would smell like.  Not minty at all though.  It is not too strong.There are ones like this and Snake Peel and Thai Massage and Hot Fever and Boost which are just so different and unique that they transport you to another world.  I think that is fun and worth it rather than the usual boring manly musk citrus mint or yucky baby powder smelling soaps.A little goes a long way too.  I think day in and day out I would get tired of it but definitely worth buying at least once for the experience.  I would give it almost  stars but close enough. Great new Axe shower gel,long way
My husband swears by Axe products (as proven by some of my previous reviews) but neither he nor I was really feeling Deep Space. The smell was kinda ehhh in comparison to his favorite (and mine)-snake peel. My suggestion if you're going for the Axe body wash for men go for their exfoliating versions (let's face it this is the only way we get a rough-skinned men to exfoliate). Plus the exfoliating versions tend to smell better (by better I mean in my husband's sense of the word--which is lighter and not-so overpowering in the perfume department since most men don't like that). Smell is not all that,Neutral
My son loves Axe products so I ordered AXE SHOWER GEL DEEP SPACE for him. Of course I had to try it as well. I was expecting it to have a powerful fragrance with a manly smell which is not the case and a pleasant surprise. Several of the Axe products I have smelled were overpowering producing the opposite affect I imagine they intended it too. Anytime I encounter a person who has such a powerful scent I have to wonder what they are attempting to hide. The gel itself is milky in color with a shin to it. While lathering you can feel the little bead like contents that provides a mild scrubbing action. The fragrant last for a time but not for long which can be a plus if you don't care for it to clash with your perfume or cologne. However I don't buy into the statement that someone would attract the opposite sex due to using this product. Of course anytime someone smells good and is clean is a plus as appose to the opposite. A GOOD SHOWER GEL,Neutral
I tried this one because I like the Axe products I've used so far. Granted it's all about the scent and the marketing attitude that comes with the product line but my experience has been that the scent is crisp clean something that feels good after a shower or shave. This product...billed as having pepper and sandalwood overtones...also has a thick heavy overbearing and overpowering scent that you can't get rid of. I'm reminded of Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd's SNL Wild & Crazy Guys the Festrunk Brothers heading off to the fox bar to pick up some foxes. Seriously. I know that sounds sarcastic but this scent is incredibly dated and brings back nothing but memories of loser club dudes who cover themselves in the worst scents imaginable sometimes in lieu of bathing. I recommendAxe Shower Gel Anarchy  Fluid Ounceinstead...this one has the fresh clean scent I described. But unless you want to come on strong...TOO strong...avoid this one at all costs. Heavy overpowering perfume-y,Neutral
I purchase/review quite a bit of Axe products but that is mainly because I have a teenage son who thinks Axe products are the height of class. This shower gel is great and I will be keeping this bottle in my shower for my personal use.The shower gel is a milky white in the bottle and when it comes out it has a shimmery almost metallic look about it.  The smell is woodsy/peppery but is not overly manly nor is it the obnoxiously loud smell that Axe products are known for.  The shower gel lathers well in a bath pouf or in a washcloth and cleans garden mud off as easily as post workout sweat.  When lathering up you definitely feel grains in the lather but there is not enough of them (in my opinion) to act as a scrub.  I use this shower gel for my nightly shower and by morning there is no lingering smell of any kind to clash with my deodorant perfume and lotion.  I'm not sure if the scent would clash with my perfume if I put it on immediately after showering.  I am very pleased with this product and although a  year old mother of  is NOT the target market for Axe products this is one product I will be a repeat buyer of. Love the smell not too manly,Neutral
first off love the smelldelicate but nice...I wear expensive perfumes every day and this rather complements the perfume not overshadowing it.I am very lucky at  to have beautiful long thick hairnever colored and it does as I wish so this shampoo for curly hair makes it super soft with well defined spiral like curls.just ordered the conditioner we shall see what the combination is like. I am a curly haired girl,Neutral
Granted I've only used this one but let me say this: thus far it's a HUGE disappointment!!!!  My wavy/curly hair is lifeless limp frizzy and dry.  It has no shine and very limp waves.It's downright silly that this is marketed to curly girls as moisturizing.There were varied reviews on the smell.  It is a perfume-like smell but I do not find it strong or offensive.  It's not my favorite smell but it's pretty clean and not bad.  (Do note of course that I am accustomed to Nexxus products that are definitely scented.)My previous shampoo choices were Nexxus Weightless and Joico KPak.  I recommend either (the Kpak is more moisturizing but I think the Nexxus is excellent for allow your hair to bounce).I will use this product a few more times and update if there is any change in my impression.  I think I'll be giving this away.  Would LOVE your best recommendations for curly girl products that work! Huge Disappointment!!!!,Neutral
I've been using L'Oreal's Cleansing conditioner the first product since it came out ( January-ish ). I've done a review of that product here http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGVCWPVZB/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF&ASIN;=BHIHYM&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=I really love this product and I recommend it highly. When I saw there was another iteration of it out there I grabbed it right away. I don't really have curly hair sometimes wavy sure but curly not really. I picked this up so I could spice it up a bit. I like being able to have different scents for moods but after using this stuff for so long I can't under any circumstances use normal shampoo and conditioners anymore they are terrible for my hair I right away feel the difference and it's HELL. ( ill explain more) This one smells like clean soapy and refreshing. Not too perfumery but it still has a strong scent like the other one) After using the cleansing conditioner my hair is longer and isn't frizzy and minimal split ends. It's no longer dry or damaged and looks so much healthier it also combs out nicely I used to be a leave in conditioner freak and ever since using this I no longer need to use that stuff. No other products are needed either! You can pick this up at target for $. and you can ALWAYS find a $ off coupon in the red plum junk mailer or the newspaper. As I write this review the cost is listed at $. and no way in hell do I think that is an appropriate price for  bottle. The other day it was $. Amazon must be screwy today.In order to properly use this you will need to experiment a few weeks until you find out exactly how much you need to use. For me I use  to  pumps of the original evercreme product clean and then use  pumps at the end for a condition and rinse. and with this one I use about  pumps and  at the end. My friend can use  pumps and her hair isn't as long I think it depends on several factors you hair thickness your ph balance your oilyness of your scalp etc.  MANY people complain at first that their hair is too oily using this product it's likely that you have not found your limit yet. Many people will start by getting confused and using either WAY too much or way too little You might be thinking it's not cleaning (because it does not lather). I've said it before and I will say it again it's like cleaning your windows.You don't want to use too little windex with just one paper towel because you won't clean it off just rub the dirt around. This is a whole new way to clean your hair so you need to learn how to do it right for you and every persons follicles are different. It's crap for the beauty industry to make you believe that just because you have Dry/oily/thick hair that just later rinse repeat will work for you the same way as it does your accountant or the lady on the tv.Anyway about the normal shampoo now that I use this it's evident how bad it is. I had some old (expensive stuff) in my shower and I used it and spent almost an hour getting out the tangles and trying to get it to calm down. It took two days for my hair to not be frizzy and it was pure hell for me. Not gonna lie I'm not insanely vain but my hair is one of those things that I can not have messed up cause it will ruin the whole day for me.Here's the link to the other product as well which I attest is awesome and it smells divine!http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Evercreme-Cleansing-Conditioner-Fluid/dp/BHIHYM/ref=cm_cr-mr-title L'Oreal Does it again! ( Please keep it coming! ),Neutral
I was excited to try the whole system. The Shampoo and Conditioner had a slight herbal smell to them (possibly rosemary oil???). They seemed to work fine.However the tonic itself was the same herbal scent but amplified a million times more it seemed. From the moment it came out of the bottle it was extremely strong. I put it on my damp hair and after that it seemed all downhill. It ended up on my clothes bedding car headrest couch and anywhere else my head or hair had rested on in some way. As I am writing this it has been four days since I had sprayed the tonic on my hair. I washed my hair everyday with a different shampoo and conditioner and the smell is STILL in my hair. I flat ironed sprayed a conditioning oil with its own scent on my hair sprayed strawberry perfume all over me febreze all over my home. It is STILL lingering.I don't recommend using the tonic if you don't have to. The system did thicken my hair in even just one use despite the awful scent. If you are desperate to thicken your hair and don't mind the scent you have to bear this is an inexpensive solution to your problem. If you can't stand strong scents DO NOT use this. It works but the scent is too strong,Neutral

Pink Resistance in real life is actually not like the shade displayed as seen as the product profile picture.  In the picture the color seems like a pastel pink but in reality it's a darker light pink.  The product is not a runny liquid but also not pasty like liquid lipstick.  As you place the applicator to your lips you can feel the cool liquid against your lips.  Instantly I felt the product feeling sticky on my lips.  According to online beauty gurus for the product to actually work it's necessary to do one coat wait for a minute then apply a second coat.  The color does stay for awhile and if you're not bothered by the stickiness of the product you should be fine.  As for the smell it has a floral smell to it (like floral perfume) but I'm used to it so the scent doesn't even seem strong to me.  This lip stain is apparently a copy cat for the YSL lip stain in the beauty world.  For those on a budget that can't blow  bucks over a high end brand lip stain this product is said to be comparable as most beauty advisors claim.  This stain definitely didn't disappoint me. Price good quality good,Neutral
This is an excellent product that does what it says it will do.  After I washed and towel dried my hair and it was still damp I massaged a dab of Dove Color Care Leave On Conditioner through my hair and it was soft and manageable all day.  There is no strong perfume or chemical smell.My hair is baby fine and many products do not perform as promised but this Dove Conditioner lived up to all its ads assured.  I will surely buy it again. Massage a little on damp hair and voila!,Neutral
This has such a strong initial fragrance that the post office opened up the package it came in to inspect it and taped it back up before sending it on to me!  Its a heavy perfume smell that is pretty nice but awfully strong.I live in sunny Florida and am in the blazing sun at least partially most days.  I also am a swimmer almost daily now that it's nice and hot outside.  This really takes a toll on my hair.I've been keeping my hair shorter due to the beating it takes and it still tangles quite a bit after I wash it.  It also fades rapidly after coloring usually within a month.  The original color is nowhere to be seen and I am left with brassy highlights that were once a lovely dark blond.  This does help to keep the color in longer.  My color looks more vibrant after I use it and my hair doesn't fade out.  I had just colored my hair after I used this and have been using it for over a week every day after being in the pool and haven't seen the usual fast fade into brass that usually happens.My hair also is much easier to brush after I wash it.  Usually it's quite a struggle to get any comb or brush through it when it's wet but this takes the tangles out nicely.This totally removes all brassiness from my blond highlighted hair and returns it to a gorgeous ashy color.  And it does it without being purple like other brass removers.  It's not advertised as a brass remover but it works better for this than anything I've used.I feel that for me where I live it's very important to use a conditioner that protects the color and keeps it from fading rapidly more so than if I lived in a climate with less sun and less chlorine from pools.This adds body softness smoothness and takes brassy tones out of blond hair.  It's the best. Does a good job of protecting color removes brassiness,Neutral
I bought the matching shampoo to go with my new conditioner and I absolutely love them. I do have home-colored hair and it gets very dry. However I find that most shampoo and conditioner marketed as extra conditioning or for color treated hair leaves a nasty slimy film on my scalp and I end up scratching my head all day. These Dove products are different than any others I have tried. My scalp feels completely clean and my hair is shiny without any oily nastiness. The frizz at the ends of my layered hair is tamed. I have noticed a few fly aways on top of my head but since I use a styling creme in the mornings that gets taken care of.The fragrance in this conditioner smells amazing not strong or perfumey just lovely. I have bad seasonal allergies right now which leave me really sensitive to fragrances I can't wear perfume this time of year. I had no trouble with the scent of the conditioner or the matching shampoo. I really love them. my hair smells sooooooooo good,Neutral
This dense conditioner squeezes out of its tube almost like toothpaste so a little goes a long way. It has a light scent which I really appreciate--I don't enjoy using products with a strong perfume smell. Unlike some conditioners for color treated hair this rinses out quickly and completely leaving hair full not flat. After use my hair had body and shine--I'm very happy with this product. Light scent lots of body,long way
When I opened the package I definitely smelled the scent of the conditioner.  I thought it smelled very nice and loved it.  Using it on my hair was fine.  It conditioned my hair just right and as my hair is color treated I felt safe trying the product.  As the day wore on my hair stayed soft and the scent ever gently disappeared but that was ok with me.  I did like the smell but wear my own perfume.  Dove color care conditioner is not expensive and I thought it worked well.  That's enough for me. Nice Conditioner for Color Treated Hair,Neutral
Pros+Works well+Smells good but not overwhelmingCons-Tube isn't designed to be held and squeezed by slippery handsI am once again impressed with Dove's products. I used this in place of my conditioner and it made my hair more shiny and silky. When used for a few days in a row the effects intensify. As a disclaimer though it will do nothing for split ends. Just trim those.The smell is pleasant and very floral but not overwhelming and it doesn't linger for too long leaving you able to use your perfume without worries. The conditioner is very thick and creamy and it takes a little longer to rub in but the results are worth the effort and it rinses out quickly.My only complaint is that unlike most other Dove products this one is tricky to hold and squeeze when in the shower. I certainly would recommend this product as it does everything it claims. Quality Conditioner in Slippery Tube,Neutral
After opening the mailbox I was rather puzzled. The padded envelope from Amazon was as scented as a loveletter!Have I ordered so much that I had a secret admirer?Cooooooooool!Alas after opening it it was the Dove CC Daily conditioner. Unopened undamaged. The scent was so strong it was coming through a perfectly closed tube.Even though I find the scent WAY too strong and sweetly cloying I tried it.My naturally (NOT) raven and pink locks like it (soft nice shine) my nose can't bear it.If you like heavy sweet scent this might be fine for you. You certainly can skip wearing perfume after using it! Hold your nose!,Neutral
This leaves my hair so shiny and soft.  All the frizz is gone and it stays gone all day.I've used this both on wet hair and on dry hair.When I use this right after the shower it goes on easily and really smooths out my hair.  Drying it and using the hot iron is so much easier.On dry hair it helps me to restyle my look and tame down my hair.These Motions products have a nice light scent.  That's important to me as I seem to be very sensitive to highly perfumed products and have to stop using them even if they work great on my hair.  This item smells nice and works great.  This is a winner. Motions Straight Finish Sealer,Neutral
This is a great Leave in Conditioner.  The first couple times I used it I used too much and it was too heavy in my hair.  I've adjusted what I use and I really like it now.It's really easy to apply and leaves my hair feeling wonderful and it really controls the frizz.  I sometimes like to air dry my hair and it stays looking styled all day.The scent is perfect - not overly perfumed and it leaves my hair smelling great and very fresh and clean. Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner,Neutral
. A real disappointment. I like bb creams a lot and this is my least favorite of about  that ive tried. The light color is just too orange and dark for my fair skin. The coverage is so light it did nothing to hide mild redness. I dislike strongly scented products and this one is very perfumey. Finally this is a bb cream that has a very shiny dewy finish and I prefer less shine.If you are pale I recommend the Ponds bb cream instead. A POOR ENTRY IN THE BB CREAM CATEGORY,Neutral
I am very sensitive to scent especially anything on my face as it will irritate my eyes.  I was worried about the strong perfume like scent this cream had but it didn't bother my allergies or affect my eyes.It is as thick as the old fashioned cold cream used to be and you have to massage it into your skin  for awhile.  Once it is on it feels light not heavy.  It doesn't appear greasy either.  It does make your skin feel softer and more hydrated.  However the package suggests that you reapply it every two hours if you are outdoors or active.  I didn't think that would be necessary but I did feel the dryness return to my skin after two hours and had to reapply.  If you have applied foundation or powder over it then that isn't going to work unless you clean your face and reapply everything again.  Since I don't wear foundation or powder if I am not going anywhere special it worked alright for me.  I do appreciate how it does plump and moisturize the skin. Thick Cream with SPF,Neutral
I just received this in the mail. Instead of waiting and thinking about it I decided to write the review right off the cuff.HOLY MOLEY!!! Does this stuff contain a lot of perfume or what? I exclaimed. Phewee! Good thing I tried this on the back of my hand and not my face!So there you have it my initial reaction. It did go on smoothly made my skin look nice and a little goes a long way but there's no way I'm going to put this smelly stuff on my face near my nose and eyes. Too Stinky for Me!,long way
This cream has a VERY light tint to it quite a bit of sunscreen protection and more fragrance than my perfume.  It did provide some smoothing and I didn't experience the orange effect that some users have.  It is not as covering as foundation and it is a little sticky at first.  I used it as a light foundation on a day I was going to be in the sun and it performed well.  I did put a light dusting of powder on top to take care of a bit of shine.  If you would be using multiple products on your face in a given day this could replace a few of them to speed a morning routine.A bit of warning:  it does say to keep it out of your eyes and you should.  I accidentally got a dot near my eye and it watered for HOURS. Jack of all trades cream,Neutral
I use a different L'Oreal BB creamL'Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Magic B.B. Cream Light  Fluid Ounceand love it but I detest this version which contains a sunscreen and an obnoxious fragrance. Once I opened the tube I knew enough not to even attempt putting it on my face because I'm very sensitive to odors. Instead I rubbed it into the back of my hand. I couldn't see it but I certainly smelled it and in a few minutes a perfume-headache was starting to blossom.  I had to scrub my hand for quite some time before the smell wasn't an issue when I got it near my face.My best friend - who first introduced me to the scentless BB cream and still uses it - is not odor sensitive so she tried it for me.  And hated it.  The smell didn't make her feel ill but she found it intrusive.  But what she really disliked was the way it wouldn't cover flaws like the version above yet remained visible on her face even though she massaged it in thoroughly. Also the sensitive skin under her eyes reddened a little. She's rarely allergic to anything but she's sure she had a reaction to this.The tube went in the trash but we still love the regular L'Oreal cream in the link above. L'Oreal rarely disappoints but this one was a misfire for both of us. Give this One a Miss,Neutral
Ok first off I have sensitive skin and it is really hard for me to find anything that doesn't turn me beet red or give me lovely little pimples all over my cheeks and chin. L'Oreal's Triple Power Lotion didn't give me high hopes. And when I pumped it out and applied it I wasn't happy with how greasy it went on. It was like an oil slick on my face. But happily that didn't last long. What it left behind after sinking in was velvety smooth skin! I haven't seen a reduction in wrinkles but I take great care of my skin and truly don't have any deep lines. Now for the downside ... the smell. It is way to perfume-like and is very overpowering. After I put it on bummed around the house a bit then climbed into bed my husband thought I had just sprayed on perfume. Greasy but ...,sensitive skin
I was hopeful but then I tried it. It might work but it's perfumed so I can't use it. Sorry. Scented ick,Neutral
I decided to try loreal SPF as an alternative to my usual more expensive day cream (presciptives -a perfect world SPF ).Pros-Inexpensive for what your gettingBroad spectrum SPFSmooth silky lotionNice efficient pump dispenserCons-Very heavily perfumed (big turnoff for me)Lotion does not absorb as well as other creams and left me feeling a little greasy on hot daysI think this would be good for anyone with dry skin looking for a day cream with a higher SPF and who is not bothered by the fragrance. Not bad,dry skin
I'm sensitive to a lot of perfumey soaps and stuff that may tough my skin. My forehead breaks out from additives like a petri dish.  Nivea's body wash is wonderful stuff. Well-balanced and not bad for a sensitive guy like me (I hear that groan) sure prefer this to a soap bar! Nivea got it right,Neutral
Oh my god this is the best blush I have ever tried!(: first of all the packaging is downright adorable but durable. The blush features a light pink blush back round and in the middle is a dark pink blush in the shape of a high heel. This blush also has a mirror. I like this better than the benefit box blushes!!! The pigmentation is medium but I think it could be just a little bit more pigmented. My favorite part is the the scent!!!!!! Oh my gosh the smell of this blush is amazing! It smells sexy and just so amazing! I wish they made the scent into perfume cause I would totally buy it! People even tell me sometimes wow your face smells really good! Best Blush Ever! This is my favorite blush!!!!,Neutral
I have this in Rose. This blush has a satin finish and gives a beautiful highlight when the light catches it. Could be a bit more pigmented. I feel like I have to put on about  good layers for it to show up how I like. I also have the PH Matchmaker blush in Natural by Physicians Formula which I've been using for months and absolutely love. That one has much better pigmentation. I would probably go back to an old blush or try something new if it wasn't for the smell. It's like a light vanilla with a hint of a fruity note. It is very light and subtle but I love it. Like another reviewer said I wish they made it into a perfume. I'd buy it. And can we get a load of the packaging? So perfect. Physicians Formula always hits the nail on the head with attractive packaging.One thing about Physicians Formula makeup that kind of bothers me is that the designs and special things that they put into their makeup that makes it unique and attractive are always just stamped on top of the product so after the first or second use it's just a basic blush or bronzer. Like in this one the shimmery silver heel is gone after the first swipe of the brush. I've been using it for a week now and I'm hoping the darker pink part in the heel doesn't do the same thing (so far so good). Smells awesome,Neutral
This is amazing just smelling it in the store does it no justice!!! Took it home and it's just amazing the smell is wonderful just like I remember and the fact that it says it gives your hair shine without silicones is ALSO AWESOME. It lathers VERY well and feels sooooo soft on your hair! It's also paraben free!HERBAL essences came back to their senses and are selling two of their older collections again. I stopped using Herbal essenses years ago when they switched formulas and made HERBAL essence SMELL LIKE HEAVY PERFUME FRUIT and CANDY NOT HERBAL scented at all. Now that they are back I'm a returning customer should they pull this off the shelf again I am GONE.Smells great works well I LOVE THE OLDER bottles too it's much easier to get the product OUT of the container I cant tell you how crappy the new tops are that dont open until you've broken a finger off. THANK GOD THEY CAME TO THEIR SENSES!!!,Neutral
OLAY Daily Exfoliating Body Wash is great for using in the shower.  During the winter months you need to exfoliate your body/skin and the Olay body wash is so smooth feeling after using it my skin is very soft and no over powering perfume smell I highly recommend this product. Olay Daily Exfoliating Body Wash,Neutral
I have used Olay product in the past and never been so disappointed I really enjoy products with shea butter in them. I think that the body wash itself is okay I would not call it ultra. I can feel slight difference to regular body wash. The deal breaker for me is the overpowering flower scent it is extremely strong which would be okay if I liked the scent I hate the scent. It reminds me of an elderly woman who doesn't realize she has used to much perfume. I have had good experience in the past with Olay products but not this one. scent to strong,Neutral
This is one of the body washes that your entire family can use. It leaves the skin so soft and moisturized!! the good things is that there is no string perfume or feminine fragrance added to it so my husband can also use it and he likes it too. Great body wash with moisturizer!,Neutral
My -something year old skin has developed serious dryness issues especially during the winter months. The low price of this wash was a great incentive but ultimately the mid-range rating on Good Guide (dot com) of . made me want to try this product. These days I'm big on what goes in and ON my body so the fact that the ingredients in this creamy soap are for the most part safe is extremely important. Also important is the fact that it delivers on its moisturizing promises!My skin is now more supple and needs much less lotion during the course of the day and my back (you know the spot I'm talking about) is much less dry and itchy. This also works great as a shaving cream. Yes as the body wash formula includes Olay facial moisturizer this smells like goopy old lady soap.  Meaning it smells formulaic but not necessarily perfume-y like most heavily scented body washes on the market. The lather is so-so: use a few drops on a loofa then repeat if necessary for more bubbles.With stacking a coupon + subscribe and save I was able to try Olay Age Defying body wash for just under two bucks. Definitely worth that cost as this is a small bottle (in fact the smaller . oz size is a good thing as no wash goes to waste AND the bottle easily fits in the shower). Not exactly age defying but it cleans and moisturizes wonderfully. Great body wash if you find the right price!,Neutral
Doesn't Work AT ALL not as a spot treatment or anything...I also hate the consistency. It doesn't absorb into the skin at all. It mostly just sits on top and sometimes it even leaves a white film on top...yuck! The only reason I gave it  stars is that it smells really good hehe. It smells almost like a natural perfume. But as a spot treatment I do not recommend! Instead I recommend Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil Ointment. No no NO!,Neutral
cent is a tad strongyet smells much like a breeze blowing through jasmine blossomsso no problem for me & I'm very sensitive to many perfume scents.Not too thick or thin. Feels great going on & absorbs into skin pretty quickly.Great for more than just face & with SPF  great for being in the sun too!Very natural scentreflects sunlightfresh feeling on about - minutes & great for everywhere!I use as body lotion too in the spring & summer!Makes legs look nice to go without nylonsPerfect for summer!Enjoy!(Hoping to find in bigger bottles! Very nice light weight moisturizer!,Neutral
This cream is pretty impressive.  It doesn't smell like sunblock with that zincy smell and stickiness and it absorbs right away.  The skin feels instantly hydrated.  There is no annoying perfumes either.  The slim tube is ideal for a gym bag or purse for quick application as this is something that needs to be applied several hours a day in Arizona's heat.  The price is right too. Absorbs quickly; no stickiness,Neutral
I've been on the lookout for a moisturizer that does not irritate my nose or skin. Unfortunately I still haven't found one.This actually was okay on my skin except for a slight sticky feel on hot days. Although my skin is sensitive I did not get an allergic reaction to this. So I'll give it a few stars for that. The smell is not unpleasant it reminds me of a rose except for one thing: it irritated my sinuses just a little bit for  minutes or so after applying making me wrinkle my nose every now and then which is not attractive. Like several other reviewers I am sensitive to many perfumes and would prefer to avoid them altogether if it were possible.I did not see any luminous effect but that could be a lighting thing. The sunscreen did seem to help me avoid sunburn on a day when I went on a tour and was in the sun quite a bit. I have fair skin and will probably seek out a higher SPF when I go to the beach.Since I'm reviewing this as a Vine member I feel some obligation to go into detail so I did some research. (Vine members get free products to review.)  I looked at the ingredient list and selected some that sounded like chemicals and then checked the cosmetic database on the Environmental Working Group website. Most of the ingredients are safe but a few are questionable. Sunscreen chemicals are often problematic.  Ensulizole is known to produce free radicals when exposed to sunlight leading to damage of DNA this UVB protector may have the potential to cause cancer.Preservatives are also problematic although they are probably only used in tiny amounts in this product. One is Phenoxyethanol which the FDA has warned is toxic to infants via ingestion and can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea.  Another is Methylisothiazolinone sometimes associated with allergic reactions. Lab studies on the brain cells of mammals also suggest that methylisothiazolinone may be neurotoxic. I see that Wikipedia has a page on this chemical which you may find alarming.Because of these concerns I would caution parents to keep this out of reach of small children and to wash it off your own skin before encouraging your baby to kiss you. Also don't let a pet lick it. Whether you let your spouse kiss your face with this on it is up to you! Nice texture odor of rose but may irritate some people,little bit
The texture of this lotion is very light and non-sticky. It smells like a rose-scented perfume I used to wear sometimes.I'm not crazy about perfumey skin products but this one isn't too bad. Nice texture rosy scent,Neutral
Pond's Luminous Moisture Day SPF  Lotion . Ounce. It is a conveinent size to carry in your purse. It does help relieve dry chapped skin while protecting your face from the sun. The perfume fragrance is a bit strong if you are sensetive to smells. Pond's Luminous Moisture Day SPF  Lotion . Ounce,Neutral
I have been using this for at least a week.  It is very gentle on my skin.  The smell is not too pungent.  I know it's fragrance free but I believe that just means they don't add any perfumes or fragrances.  The natural fragrance is tolerable where most natural products have a very strong smell.  It is very soft feeling on my skin and I like the product. Gentle product,Neutral
To be honest I am a little skeptical that this product could have so much great stuff in it yet cost so little. Unfortunately it made me break out in little bumps and left my skin texture feeling rough. I decided I would still keep it and use it on my neck since I didn't have any reaction there.What is nice about it is that it goes on smoothly has a great consistency and does not have a smell. Many facial products have overpowering perfumes in them and this didn't which I found really refreshing. If I were you I would still give it a try because it is a good price for some great ingredients. The fact is any product can cause a reaction in a person and this is probably just a case of the product not agreeing with me. Doesn't work for me but it might work for you,Neutral
This perfume smells amazing both before and after it has already been applied. It has a woodsy yet spicy scent that lasts for a very long time. Whether or not it smells the same throughout the day depends on your skin. Everyone's skin chemistry is different...In fact if applied on paper and the scent settles in...it smells a bit sweeter and less spicy. On MY skin it doesn't smell as sweet afterwards which is exactly what I want from a fragrance. A lot of other celebrity fragrances have a sweet floral or fruity smell to it but this smells like pure quality. It can be worn both during the day and at night. I love how versatile this is and I am so happy I took the chance and bought it without testing it out first.The perfume personally smells great all day on my and I really can't compare it to any other scents it's definitely unique. Absolutely Amazing and Unique Scent,long time
I tried this perfume at Macy's before buying it and I was immediately amazed at how subtle the scent is.  I don't like strong perfumes and it seems like most celebrity fragrances are strong enough to knock you down -- but this one is very light and not overpowering.  You have to be very close to smell it.  On me the strongest notes are vanilla and sandalwood.While this perfume smells amazing on me it's important to note that individual skin chemistry has a powerful effect on how a perfume smells so it's a good idea to try it on (and leave it on for a few hours) before making a decision on whether or not you like it. Much better than expected,Neutral
This perfume is different but in a good way. It smells very woodsy and earthy but I think that's nice. It makes me think of sitting by a warm fire place. I would recommend this perfume for every day use. Very unique sent,Neutral
I had a hard time finding this scent in a store so I figured I would get it from Amazon. If I didn't like it then I could return it. Wrong! Because it is a liquid it is considered hazardous material and it gave me no option to return. So make sure you smell this first before you buy! BTW it smells exactly like Boyfriend by Kate Walsh which I do not like. Guess I am stuck with a stinky perfume. Never again will I buy perfume from Amazon UNLESS I have sniffed it first. beware - you won't be able to return it,Neutral
This perfume smells so beautiful!  Will wear everyday! The scent  Seems to be long lasting. Will purchase again in the future. LOVE THIS PERFUME!,Neutral
Great perfume long lasting vanilla top notes but in a mature enough base to not be childish. I call this my &#;-year-old perfume&#; because it's perfect for a  year old woman; not too young not too old-lady-ish.If you don't choose Amazon Prime and decide to purchase from the Marketplace instead I will advise against buying from Perfumeland Megastore. Ordered it on / and shipping took almost  weeks; when I finally got it on the st the package label indicated that it was shipped to the post office first then from there to my own address. I don't even want to know what mail service operates that way but it's probably the cause for the delay. Not a huge deal in the end but still the longest shipping I've ever had from an Amazon seller; even international shipping from UK sellers is faster than that. Awesome scent.,Neutral
I love this perfume.  It's not too heavy rather on the light side.  But stays on throughout the day.  I've gotten many compliments on it. Smells Great!,Neutral
I loved the feel of this soap and the cute design on it! Like other charcoal products (which are pretty much taking over the industry) the soap digs deep into pores to draw out all of the dirt. My skin felt a lot smoother after using this soap for a few days! Amazon listing says the soap is fragrance free but there was a fragrance with it that I noticed so I am not sure if this was listed with a mistake. It was a clean scent though so they could mean that there was no added perfume to the soap. What I love most about the soap is that there was only four ingredients: Vegetable Oil Water Glycerin and Bamboo Charcoal! Works great but the scent was pretty strong.,Neutral
The Al-Rehab line of perfume attars are outstanding.  There is a great variety of scents available and you only need apply a few drops as they don't contain alcohol.I am partial to the White Musk as it is spot on for the Body Shop's d/c White Musk.  TBS reformulated their White Musk and now it's weaker.I use this White Musk oil from Al-Rehab and spray some of the Body Shop old formula Vanilla Body Spray over it.You can also apply this White Musk on top of TBS Dual Vanilla Body Butter. Both combos are GREAT..sort of like Nemat's Vanilla Musk..a GREAT stand alone scent.All of these products are available on Amazon which makes shoppimg easier.Recommend vanilla lovers try this White Musk vanilla combo I made.People seem to like the mix as they ask me whay I am wearing. GREAT ATTAR!,Neutral
After I smell a perfume or cologne it's the ''after'' smell I wait for. This one had a scent that made me car sick--if you know what I mean. Everyones  nose or olfactory senses are so different. This smells like it would be nice as a soap or hand cream not a perfume oil. Ok but no cigar.. something's odd here....,Neutral
omg omg omg i love love its a whole lot u get for the price oz better than when u buy perfume n get  oz for way more the price the smell is awesome  i will defininetly  buy again great,Neutral
This big bottle of perfume it smells so good! The price was really really good! Going to have to get some more! Love Rihann,Neutral
absolutely love these  ordering more tonight ! I have to spray the perfume into the atomizer which isn't a big deal considering it takes less than a minute. if that's an issue for you I suggest buying a mini funnel to make the process somewhat easier. this is very convenient if you don't want to carry a big perfume bottle that could leak or potentially break in your purse plus the atomizers look a lot more beautiful in person ! will post pictures later hopefully. shipping does take a while but came before the estimated delivery time. its completely worth it though ! where else will you find  beautiful atomizers like these for $ ??!! perfect,Neutral
The only time I can get travel size perfume is when there is a special gift with purchase.  With the new TSA rules there is no way I can bring my regular perfume while travelling for work asI do not check my luggage.  These little atomizers are just what I need.The outer container is metal There is a plastic container with pumping spray inside.  I simply open the pump wash the container dry and spray perfume into this container from my regular perfume. With very little effort the little container is filled.  I keep one in my purse for everyday use and one in the quartz size zip lock bag for travel - remember -- per TSA.The price is great for all  good quality atomizers.  I gave a couple to my mom and daughter with a couple to spare. Nice good colors functional and handy,Neutral
Would have liked it better if it came with at least one little funnel. Even better if it was like the other type that you just put on top of the perfume bottle (like the Travelo) and pump in the perfume. But this came with nothing to get your perfume into the little bottles.You could squirt your perfume into them but you will waist so much of your expensive perfume.My suggestion is to go to &#;Hobby Lobby&#; or Michaels&#; or a hobby store and buy you a few of the miniature funnels for . and you will be happy!These were perfect little gifts or stocking stuffers as long as you put a funnel with it. Very nice,Neutral
Let me start off by saying that the Travalo containers ARE superior but they also cost a bit more.  These are a little cheaper feeling in comparison and bulkier but they aren't awful and they get the job done. They also hold ml more. I'm happy with them and they would make a great stocking stuffer!!  One other thing to note the travalo containers spray less while these spray quite a bit more. I put my strong perfumes in the travalos so I don't douse myself and overwhelm everyone around me.To Fill: You have to remove cap slide the inner perfume tube out of the outer decorative shell unscrew the bottom section then spray in your perfume screw the bottom back on and place back in the outer decorative shell. Not the end of the world but a little more work.Also the cap and bottom colored piece have an inner plastic lining to ensure a nice smooth fit. If the inner plastic piece slides further inside your pieces won't stay together without reaching inside and sliding the plastic piece back up. Not a big deal and it's only happened to me once. Just an FYIIf you don't want to deal with these slight hassles I totally recommend the travalo perfume containers. If you like Travalo but don't want to spend the money...,Neutral
they're perfect for when i travel which has been a lot lately.I love the fact they have different colors so I can keep track of which bottle is whatever perfume.They're not too big so you can put a day's amount in there and it's still got some room. love em,Neutral
I received these a few days ago. The shipping took a while. But they arrived in good condition. I agree with other reviews that it can be difficult to remove the case for filling the bottles but with a little elbow grease it works out. I've used one so far and it sprays well. It actually holds a good amount of perfume so you shouldn't have to refill that often. A few people mentioned losing perfume but if you hold the bottle exactly next to your perfume spray top the loss is negligible if any. Getting the job done,Neutral
I was intrigued by Nivea's body wash because I am a sucker for a great smelling and hydrating body wash. I already love Nivea's body lotion so this was a logical choice.However in terms of intense moisture and hydration Olay and Dove have Nivea beat. The smell was unique light and fresh but not intoxicating and did not linger. That might be great for some people because it won't interfere with your perfume but as I don't wear perfume I noticed the lack of lingering scent. I still prefer Dove or Olay Body wash,Neutral
I'm a bit of a body wash connoisseur.  I buy all kinds most of them more high-end than Nivea.  I often use philosophy Crabtree & Evelyn Perlier and Bath and Body Works.  I recently tried a Dove moisturizing body wash that I thought was pretty nice.  That one was creamier and more moisturizing than this one.  However since it's Summer my skin doesn't need the extra moisture so much and this body wash is fine for now.  It has a nice floral fragrance which I like since I always choose florals.  I don't want to smell like food.  I don't find that this fragrance stays with me for very long after my shower.  That is normally important in the high-end washes I buy to layer with lotions or perfumes but for this type of product it's okay.  It doesn't interfere with whatever perfume I choose to wear.  This body wash lathers up nicely which is very important to me.  The bottle says it has moisture beads but again I don't find it to be extra-moisturizing. Decent body wash nice fragran,Neutral
If you are looking to take a shower to revive yourself then this is the shower gel for you!  As soon as you pop the cap on this Frangipani shower gel the scent wafts up and gets your attention.  I am very impressed not only with the initial scent but the fact that it actually lasts long after you leave the bathroom.  I was receiving compliments all day after first using this product!  I can't recommend it highly enough.If you aren't one for scented items anything with perfumes or dyes then I think you should stick to the Ivory or Dove products.  If you don't have a problem with scents and like me seek them out then give this Nivea Frangipani Shower Gel a try.  I doubt you will be disappointed. Wonderful scent that lasts!,Neutral
Nicely fragranced not too floral perfumed or sweet.Lathers well even in our very hard water.A little bathing luxury that leaves skin smooth and refreshed gently cleansing and a good value.Fragrance is pleasant while bathing and barely noticeable once skin is dry so there's no competing with perfumes. Pleasant Fragrance,Neutral
I ordered this product on Feb  and received it on March st! (Regular shipping) The pores on my cheeks had been getting out of control as well as the ones on my nose so I was excited to try this mask; I washed my face with a sugar scrub and then regular face wash before applying I took a nap while it dried and when I peeled it off I instantly felt a difference! My skin was soft and after a couple more uses my pores were clean and less noticeable I definitely recommend this. The only problem for me is that the smell is a little too perfumey for my taste didn't stop me from using it though. Great product! loved this mask!,great product
I give the product four stars because the big flipper solvent pump bottle the remover comes in is the best you can buy for acetone! I highly recommend this product solely for that reason. It is so much easier to remove your polish and clean your konad plates with this bottle.However the Remove+ nail polish remover smells so disgusting. They obviously add so much perfume to mask the smell of the acetone but i honestly would prefer the acetone over this awful headache-inducing floral scent.Remove+ is basically just acetone with glycerin added to make it less irritating on your skin. I have been using % pure acetone w/ added glycerin for about a year now and Remove+ does not work any better than the homemade mixture. So I will use up the Remove+ and then fill it with my regular polish remover because it would be very wasteful to dispose of the liquid just because it smells REALLY REALLY REALLY TERRIBLE. Smells AWFUL. Doesn't work better than regular acetone/glycerin,Neutral
This is the perfect size to hold makeup  kleenex packs hair ties medicine perfume floss hand sanitizer and lotion... At least that is what mine holds nicely in my purse.  It keeps me from having to dig around in my purse or various smaller bags for items I need quickly.  Mine still has room  despite all that including the huge powder compact  or more lip products and such. Perfect,Neutral
No complaints here - compliments in fact! I have hard water but my dishes come out of the washer nice and clean (and I'm not one of those people that wash my dishes before I put them in the dishwasher). I have gone through a few packages already and don't plan on changing...I also like that there is no perfume and it doesn't contain phosphates or other nasty stuff. Works well,Neutral
This stuff smells a lot like Revlon's Fire and Ice perfume only richer and more luxurious. The bottle is huge and a few squirts is enough for medium-longish hair so the bottle will last you a long time. My hair is so soft and shiny I only wish I had found this stuff sooner! Smells amazing,long time
The oil is too perfumed for my liking. I would have appreciated a coconut scent or something of the sort but it smells like cheap perfume. It does a good job of taming fly away hairs and is very light- doesn't weigh down my long hair. I like the functionality but I could do with a lighter smell. Great price- weird scent,Neutral
The mud has a thick jelly like consistency. I found the mask comfortable to wear. It was fun to put it on forget about it and freak out the family when I walked out with mud all over my face.You may wonder what it smells like. I am big on smelling things before I put them on. I am not allergic to perfumes/dyes but I know many others are. This fragrance has a strong eucalyptus scent. I was not expecting the mask to make my skin tingle but it did in a good way. The mud is ugly but the scent and tingly sensation on my face were wonderful.The results? When I washed off the mud and patted my skin dry my pores felt tighter but my face was not dry. My skin felt smooth and refreshed. I look forward to using this mask again next week. Love this mask!,dry skin
This dead sea mask that is already all made for you all you need to do is apply. You can use this on your face all over and I tried it in my hair as well. It says for your face but it did wonders for my hair as well. This smells just like mud with a hint of a bit of perfume like. You apply to face and let it sit until its drying and starts to flake. I prefer a thinner face mask more so of a thicker one as it takes longer to dry. After its all off it makes your skin feel amazingly soft and fresh feeling. Didn&#;t dry my skin out at all. When I washed it out of my hair didn&#;t use any shampoo or conditioner so it can stay in longer even though its out of my hair (something a salon told me to do) and in the morning I took a shower and my hair was so soft I couldn&#;t remember the last time I had that feeling at the salon years ago. The container is pretty big so you get tons of uses for your face or few with your hair. I love dead sea mask it just makes your face and body feel so good inside. Be sure to try them out! No dead skin left behind.,dry skin
I found all three recommended ways to use it worked.. On damp hair then dried with a hair dryer. On dry hair then brushed. On ends to make them less frizzyYou only need a little spray unless you want a greasy look to your hair. It can be used instead of serum to keep hair from flying away and getting frizzy. It says it lasts for  hours and I verified that not only was my hair still shiny after that time but the fragrance was evident.It's difficult to described the Fragrance - but it's foodie rather than flowery smelling a bit like a cinnamon bun or pumpkin pie with fruity overtones. The smell is quite strong. I prefer flowery strong French perfumes to fruity smells however it's not unpleasant. I suspect if you had a strong perfume or deodorant that it might clash with the scent - so for some people an unscented version might be nice. As I get used to the smell it seems more pleasant. Sniff a sample if you can before you buy if you don't like strong smells.  So I'll give it a  instead of a  for the smell.The first four ingredients are cyclopentasiloxane (a silicone to stop the hair breaking) dimethicone (also known as polydimethylsiloxane a silicone oil that makes hair slippery) lauryl alcohol (an emollient to smooth and soothe) and Fragrance.  The  exotic oils are from argan (a desert plant from Morocco)  safflower olive sesame and jojoba plants or seeds. A final ingredient is panthenol that binds to hair and seals it.The liquid is a slightly orange-tinged clear oil. It feels gentle on the skin. My hair tends to frizz and fly away so I like the Keragloss Oil as it tames my mane. Great for smooth silky hair,Neutral
I was really curious to try the Pantene Pro-V Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist and admit that I was expecting some kind of spray version of the standard hot oil treatments from ages ago. I figured it would be a slightly heavy product that would have to be used in severe moderation so that it didn't weigh down your hair.Instead I was delighted to find that this mist is incredibly light yet instantly imparts a gorgeous shine and the almost palpable feeling that you're truly nourishing your hair.  The oil mist lives up to its name -- it's a gentle puff of fine mist that doesn't weigh hair down and is especially ideal for use before you use heat-styling products. When I did so I ended up with perfect styling and a soft added shine (plus the feeling of strong healthy heat-styled hair -- no dryness or heat damage).I'd enthusiastically recommend the Keragloss Oil Mist especially to those whose hair needs an ongoing daily boost of strength nourishment and shine.  The bottle size is substantial -- you easily get enough mist for several months even with daily use. Best of all the scent of the Keragloss mist is divine -- a lovely perfume with slightly musky undertones. A surprisingly light luscious mist for shine,Neutral
This product is fine but not exceptional.  Who knows if there is a real repair effect.  For what it's listed at today $. either stick with a product you know you love or getSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil  Ounceas an add-on item for a third of the price.  I've got both sitting here side by side and they are both  ounces and basically do the same things:  Add shine and a conditioning effect.  Here are some key points about this product:It's in a spray bottleIt has a pleasant but strong perfume smell initially; I applied it last night but the smell is gone nowIt does add some shine but easy to overdoNot great for second day hairMade in the USAExpensive compared to other drugstore brands There are better products,Neutral
Sometimes (I don't know how or why) my hair gets *dry*--all scraggly and straw-like. And this spray pretty much instantly revives my hair back into it's normal state. Not super-shiny but normal looking. I have medium-fine wavy hair that gets curly and/or frizzy when humid.I got this product hoping it would do more for frizz but that's not what it's good at. I just wind up with nice shiny frizz. :)One star docked for being so heavily perfumed. Other than that it's a good product. Does what you'd hope a conditioner would do but with easy instant as-needed application. You don't need much either. This bottle should last a long time. Great for dry hair,long time
I have very fine thin hair that has a frizz problem. I hoped this product would eliminate the frizz and make my hair sleeker. Instead it just weighed my hair down. I gave it  stars because it might work fine for someone with thicker or coarser hair. I should add I was not crazy about the perfumey smell. I wish they had just left it unscented. Not good for fine thin hair,Neutral
It tightens up you skin when first applied.  I could not get used to its non perfumed natural smell similar to a protein odor.I have not seen any long term changes due to this product after using it for several weeks regularly . Maybe my skin is not going to respond to Matrixyl and peptides.Seller is a lovely person to deal with and is very helpful. Product is in a sealed bottle protected from air oxidation or contamination from user's fingers. Skin tightening serum,Neutral
This bottle resembles a fine perfume decanter so it's pretty enough to display if you wish.  The oil is very effective in de-frizzing hair and rendering it soft.  The length and condition of your hair will determine the amount you need to apply--use the dropper to release what you need in your palms rub them together and run your hands through the hair.  My hair is fine so I don't need too much or it will become limp.  A little goes a long way.  Results in silky shiny hair. Silky soft hair,long way
To be perfectly honest I love this stuff. It makes my hair nice and soft easy to control and it does what it says it will: reduces frizz. The bottle has a screw on lid and you pour the stuff into your hand which made me nervous because that's a good way to spill and waste a lot of product but the stuff comes out rather slowly so it's easy to control how much you get and you don't need very much for one treatment. When I first smelled it in the bottle I thought it smelled very strong and very much like my grandmothers perfume but on my hair with the smell more diluted it's fine.However I got this for free from amazon vine in exchange for a review so when I saw the price holy crap! I mean it does it's job so if you can afford it and you're fed up enough with your frizz then I'd say this is definitely the product for you. But there are definitely products out there that you can get more of for a lot less money that will do the job just as well.I will try to update this review on how long this bottle lasted for me. Good but Too Expensive,Neutral
When I saw how much this product cost I vowed that it had better leave my hair looking like spun gold.So I finally tried it - and it does exactly what it claims to do. It left my hair (on first application) softer and even less frizzy though I dried it with the hair dryer and it has no nasty cheap perfume smell to get in the way of my own cologne. It just leaves my hair smelling fresh and natural. There is no greasy feel it does not weigh my hair down in any manner - as a matter of fat my hair looks fuller and feels thicker.I have been lightening my hair for years and it is very dry and damaged. I have been trying various products without the results I wanted to see. I started to feel like these products only worked on the hair women with a different genetics than I am. That perhaps blonds missed the gravy train when it came time for these oils to work on their hair.Frankly this product really works. And like the other reviewers have said it is quite pricey. However you only need a tiny little amount (not as much as recommended on the package) so this bottle may last me a year if not at least  months. That alone makes even this price worth it. If I add up all the other inferior products I have wasted my money on this year (like my fiasco withIt's a  Miracle Leave-In Product -Ounce Bottlethe cost of useless products would come to be a LOT more than the cost for Arganesse.This will make a lovely and impressive Christmas/Holiday gift for any woman on your list. The bottle is gorgeous and comes packaged so beautifully that any woman would be proud to have this on her shelf. Expensive But Worth It,Neutral
Before I got this product I searched everywhere online for a list of the ingredients and frustratingly didn't find them. This is the ingredient list:cyclopentasiloxane (a silicone which evaporates after you apply it)dimethicone (a silicone)argan kernel oiltocopherol acetatefragranceSince argan oil is the third ingredient by my calculations this product cannot possibly contain more than % argan oil. However it might contain % argan oil it's impossible to say from this information only that the product is MOSTLY silicone. So I decided to do an experiment. Because you know maybe there is still something amazing about this product that I'm not seeing that makes it worth a super extra premium price.I ordered an ounce of actual argan oil from amazon (for twelve bucks) and grabbed a bottle of silicone laminate (I had a bottle of Citre Shine so that's what I used I think a bottle of Frizz Ease might simulate this product a bit better.) Silicone laminate products are generally pretty inexpensive. You could get a four ounce bottle of Citre Shine for four bucks or a . bottle of Frizz Ease for eight bucks last time I checked.First I washed my hair towel dried and applied this Arganesse Hair Treatment. My hair has had some severe chemical damage lately but I've been trying to baby it and save it rather than ending up bald or with a weird mullet so that is why I was looking at argan oil products in the first place. The smell is like really cheap drugstore perfume...not nice at all but fortunately not noticeable once hair dries. I found that my hair was very nice and shiny and smooth after using it.Next I waited a few days and washed and towel dried my hair but this time I applied the el cheapo Citre Shine with a little bit of argan oil mixed in. Once my hair dried...it was exactly as nice and shiny and smooth as it was with the Arganesse.Finally I tried mixing this product with the argan oil and it did a good job of helping to spread my supplementary argan oil around my hair but otherwise the results were the same as with the previous two attempts. The effect on the hair seems to come from the silicone you are putting on it. Silicone can actually make your hair look really good. It's not repairing your hair at all but it can hide damage very well. You should probably do a clarifying treatment every once in a while as silicone can build up too much and weigh your hair down.I've thought of doing a few more variation of the experiment. I really think the result is from all the silicone you are putting on your hair and not from the (unknown quantity of) argan oil at all so I was thinking of doing a clarifying treatment on my hair and then trying again with JUST silicone laminate and then maybe trying again with just some argan oil mixed into some non-silicone leave in conditioner and I've also thought of trying this product:Hair Ecstasy Shining Silicone & Argan Oil Hair Polisher  Oz which looks to be pretty much the same thing at about /th the price but for now I'm satisfied that this is just an overpriced bottle of silicone and not some magically wonderful treatment for your hair that simply must be amazing because it's so expensive. mostly silicone so I decided to experiment...,little bit
Amazon's product description doesn't list the ingredients for this leave in treatment. Upon inspection this is what it contains:Cyclopentasiloxane Dimethicone (two silicones)Argania Spinasa Kernal oil (argan oil)Tocopheral Acetate (vitamin E oil) and fragrance.I don't like putting silicone in my hair because of the buildup and drying qualities of it. It basically coats your hair with 'plastic'. I also did not care for the strong fragrance. It's hard to place the smell but it reminds me of one of those old lady perfumes from the 's like Jovan Musk or Vanilla Fields.I'm giving this product  stars though because my hair does look better. It's definitely shiney and has body and the bottle will likely last a long time as I'm only using a dime size amount at a time. I appreciate that the company doesn't test on animals and is made in the USA. However since I prefer natural/organic products when this runs out I'm going to try a bottle of pure organic Argan Oil which can be purchased on Amazon for a fraction of the price. Silicone and Argan oil,long time
I have very dry hair so I was looking forward to the Arganesse Hair Treatment.  I found that it does help the dryness without feeling heavy or greasy.  The smell is light and pleasant.  It gave my hair shine and made it a little smoother.  The biggest problem that I had was the bottle.  It is pretty and reminds you of a nice perfume but it is awful for a hair product.  There is no pump or even a cap to allow for even distribution.  You basically have to carefully pour it out in your hand.  That is way too much trouble for a high end product.  If you aren't careful you will spill it or just pour too much out.  I don't understand why a product this expensive was put into a bottle that easy to waste. Nice,Neutral
Simply Beautiful Argan Oil Hair Treatment With Pure Moroccan Ingredients - mlI have waist length dark brown hair and of course it tangles easily at this length. I'm also an amputee with just one leg so conventional conditioners are something I have to take care with as they make the bath very slippery &#; if I&#;m not careful I achieve something like the &#;Bambi&#; effect and as I've found to my detriment bones break easily :( When I was asked if I wanted to test this it seemed like an easy solution. Wash my hair and simply apply a few drops while wet.I've been using it for three weeks now on wet hair when just washed but also on dry hair between washes. It's left my hair silky smooth and a little goes along way &#; I use two squirts rub my hands together and apply to the length and ends of hair avoiding the roots. Too much and hair just looks greasy though I think an in-depth application wrapped in a hot towel would be a great conditioner for very dry hair.Its a very lightly scented product to me having a very faint rose scent &#; I love essential rose oil as a perfume so this is a perfect complement. I live on the North Norfolk coast close to the sea so we have some very drying winds which make my hair difficult to handle when I&#;ve been outside. I've found far fewer problems since I&#;ve been using this oil and would happily recommend it. Bonus that its great on my hands too!Product supplied by sellers. excellent on my long hair,argan oil
There is really no need to spend a lot of money on silicone smoothers when you get the same results with an inexpensive brand like this one.  If you want to increase the conditioning put a dab of argan oil in your palm along with this heat-shield rub your hands together to distribute & then gently smooth through your wet hair.I personally don't like to use a lot of hair products with silicone because I find they build up & dry out my hair if used too frequently. If you do like the effect of silicone products on your hair it is a good idea to use a shampoo with sulfate ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate to remove the buildup. Dimethicone is an especially non-soluble (won't wash out with water) silicone & may even take more than one wash to remove. Sulfate shampoos can be more harsh on hair so if you are prone to damaged/dry hair you may want to avoid those shampoos or use them occasionally to remove buildup.This has a short ingredient list:  Cyclopentasiloxane Dimethicone Fragrance/Parfum Panthenol Ceteareth- Alcohol Denat.  The fragrance is not heavy & has that typical Pantene smell; to me the perfume is not good or bad & it doesn't linger.-Cyclopentasioxane: This is silicone in liquid form. Evaporates so doesn't weigh down hair or leave a greasy feel.-Dimethicone: A silicone-based polymer that provides smoothness.-Panthenol: Derivative of vitamin B (pantothenic acid) and is known as a provitamin.  It is very humectant so provides moisture retention.-Ceteareth-:  Fatty alcohol that is used as an emulsifier (keeps ingredients mixed together).This works almost as well as the Paul Frieda Frizz-Ease Sheer Solution but not quite as good.  The Pantene is a few dollars cheaper so if it works better for you - you can save some money. Inexpensive Silicone Smoother/Protector & It Works,argan oil
Overall I like this product.  Like most Pantene products it has a vaguely pleasant perfumed smell.  The results are good if not amazing; leaves hair with a smooth healthy finish.  The texture of the product is a bit on the tacky side. Pleasant smell good results kind of sticky,Neutral
This is the real stuff here - no artificial colors additives or perfumes. Bottle contains from % Argan oil that is all that is listed in the ingredients.Argan Oil has too many uses to mention. Use it for your dry skin sunblock scars help strengthen nails relieve arthritis pain and massage sore muscles help dry dull hair come back to life and even culinary uses such as salad dressing! These are just a few examples.I use Argan Oil almost daily to combat the daily use of the heating appliances I use on my hair. It penetrates deep into the hair and adds instant shine and moisture that lasts all day. A tiny bit goes a long ways. Glides on easily and it is non-greasy so it does not weigh hair down. Great for taming those dry frizzy split ends.Sample provided for review. % PURE Argan oil,argan oil
Hi this is Terry's wife.  I bought the Naturally Mediterranean eye cream because I've had a problem with dark circles under my eyes lately.  I love products that are all natural as opposed to products that are heavily perfumed and filled with chemicals.  I've been using the eye cream twice a day for a week now so I could give it a fair review.I like how gentle it is and I very much like the fragrance.  It's not too strong and sort of smells like the frankincense and myrrh that my aunt and uncle sent me for Christmas when I was a girl.  It works well to moisturize the area around my eyes and I've definitely noticed my skin looks better in the X magnifying mirror I use to pluck my eyebrows.The only negative I would note is the fact that I still have dark circles under my eyes.  I was hoping those would fade as the product page claims but maybe that will just take a bit more time.  If it happens at some point in the future I'll be sure to come back and update this review. I love the fragrance and gentleness of this all natural eye cream,Neutral
Yalmeh Eye Cream is feels great around my eyes. It's also good to use on any fine lines like those around your mouth or forehead. I've used eye creams in the past that have a tightening feature to them to reduce fine lines and that leaves a tightness and film that even peels off. I hate the flaking and peeling of other eye creams. Yalmeh feels so nice going on and make my eye area feel supple and soft. It isn't greasy at all either.I really like that it contains no mineral oil propylene glycol or parabens.It is isn't perfumed but I wouldn't say that it is unscented. It has a very nice pleasant and natural scent.I really like it! Makes My Eyes Feel Soft and Supple,Neutral
When I buy eye creams I am typically treated to a tiny jar of product.  I have to say that the Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream is a nice sized item and is a good value for the price.  Also their guarantee can not be beaten!I found the cream itself to be highly fragrant.  The cream applied very smoothly and felt wonderful.  It's a light cream that I've been using around my eyes and also on my upper lip to stop any wrinkles from setting in due to dryness.  I am  and am blessed with very nice skin and a youthful complexion.  A product like this helps me stay that way.The fragrance is more than I would have expected for an eye cream.  I am unsure if this would create an allergic response to anyone who might use it who has allergies to perfumes scents.  I am highly sensitive but this one did not seem to bother me.Of note: I was provided with a sample to test and review. A very fragrant nice light eye cream,Neutral
Hi this is Terry's wife.  I'm the one who ordered the eye cream.  This product works well as a moisturizer.  It didn't cause any itching or burning around my eyes and it helped eliminate the tiny flecks of dry skin I get in my eyebrows.  I've used it several months now and I do think the dark circles under my eyes are fading.  It smells of jasmine which I notice most of the day.  It's almost as if I'm wearing perfume. Gentle moisturizer - smells a bit like jasmine,dry skin
The mandarin is the strongest fruit note on me and and coupled with the raspberry gives the fragrance a soft fuzzy feel. The lemon gives the quieter fruit a bit of bite and energy.The floral notes used in ISLAND FANTASY remain watery and in the background. There is a breeze of orange blossom freesia and occasional hint of violet underneath it all but none of the floral notes are truly strong enough to stand out from the fruits for long. This is definitely a fruity perfume.There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base thanks to the constant trickle of summery fruits. I'm sure there is some sandalwood here as after a few hours ISLAND FANTASY begins to remind me of J.Lo Love & Glamour which uses bucket loads of it. I also detect a coconut scent too.Official Scent notes: citruses mandarin clementine red berries jasmine violet freesia musk and sugar cane.***Overall: ISLAND FANTASY is pleasant and easy to wear. I'll mainly stick to wearing it on casual days but you could get away with wearing it to work if you wanted to. ISLAND FANTASY does go close to the skin fairly quickly but a faint woody scent is still detectable five hours later. So yeah; this is quieter and doesn't wear as long as the rest of the Fantasy line so beware of that Yummy,Neutral
Of course!! It is a Britney's perfume so I couldn't expect less that this perfect and delicious perfume. I recomend it for Britney's fans like me Lol!! It is worth it to get it. If you haven't gotten any Britney's perfume before you should try this one. It goes perfectly for summer days. I love the bottle!! I got perfect on time and with a super nice wrap. I love it!!!,Neutral
Island Fantasy smells like mouthwatering citrus with a nice dose of violet and sugar on top (all of my favorites!). Definitely delicious smelling if you enjoy tropical scents.  I only gave it  stars because it's an EDT and doesn't last as long as the other Fantasy perfumes but it does last longer than Escada's Rockin Rio for me so I would still recommend this. TROPICAL AND DELICIOUS!,Neutral
I love this smell out of all her other fantasy scents but it is toilette so it's not that long lasting or strong BEST FANTASY PERFUME,Neutral
This is one of britney's best perfumes. It is so fresh and the bottle is huge! You will really enjoy this if you like fresh light scents rather then very sugary sweet scents. To me it smells like watery greens with a tiny bit of sweet. One of the best!,Neutral
I just received this yesterday and tried it out right away.  I have very sensitive skin so I always proceed with caution when I try something new.  I used a little on the back of my hand first before trying it on my face.  It has a very mild pleasant smell.  This was a relief to me b/c I don't like overly perfumed up products.  The moisturizer absorbed quickly as well.  My hand felt very soft and I had no irritation at all.  Last night I used the moisturizer on my face as intended.  Once again I was very pleased with the smell quick absorption and feel of my skin after.  Most importantly my sensitive skin had no irritation at all!  Big win when it comes to a product I use on my face.  I will have to follow up in regards to how it works over the long-haul.  My initial experience is two thumbs up! Love it!,sensitive skin
Not quite sure about this Argan oil.  Has a much different smell  perfume just cannot explain it well.  Not very impressed at this time!  Sorry just not the same as I am use too! Not quite sure about this Argan oil. Has a ...,argan oil
I had been looking for a pore type strip that was black - they are big in Asia. Which makes sense right - you want to see that the product worked after you peel it off. This is a goop type product that you squeeze out place where you want (I use it on my nose only) and wait for it to dry then peel off. It dries pretty quickly and is easy to remove. The only down side is that there is a horrible perfume type smell. So strong that one night my sister asked what that smell was and she was in the room down the hall. But a small price to pay in my opinion as it works fairly well and is not expensive. Good product - very strong smell,Neutral
I bought this even though I really REALLY don't need another BB cream.  I have two that I normally use and love the Stila bronzing bb and an Asian brand BB cream from Lioele.  In the Ponds product I was looking for a matte finish.  It really really delivers!  The cream comes out and as I was spreading it on my face I thought this is NOT going to be matte but it dries to a totally matte finish.  It's not greasy or oily at all.At first I thought the color was going to be too light.  As soon as I put it on my face I thought OH NO this is wrong.  BUT rest assured the color does oxidize and darkens a bit as you spread it.  The color is obviously not going to be a perfect match because this isn't foundation.  As with most BB creams there are only a few colors to choose from however this product is so light that these shades should work for MANY people.The coverage is average for a BB cream.  It's light and airy not heavy at all and provides a bit of coverage but it is buildable.  The thing I noticed right away that may be off putting to many would be the smell.  Personally I like it because it reminds me of my grandmother.  It is distinct and I'm guessing many Ponds products smell like this.  I can imagine some women saying it's very perfume-y.  It doesn't last very long and isn't a big deal to me personally. a matte bb cream finally.,Neutral
The coverage is good and the finish is smooth but the smell ugh. I don't want to put this on my face and go out in public. Can they make an unscented version? I dislike perfumed facial moisturizers etc. I think if you don't mind their cold cream smell you won't mind this either but I don't like it. Otherwise good product. Note: the light shade is a little darker than what is usually called light. Strong fragrance is a turn-off,Neutral
This BB cream has a very strong perfume scent to me. I don't like it it's too overwhelming. The scent reminds me of an old lady's perfume. Also I find that this cream is thicker and heavier than my other BB cream that I use L'Or&eacute;al. Too perfumey,Neutral
Put any amount of this oil on your hair and you will instantly be transformed as though you had joined the ranks of the great unwashed.  Seeing as I bought it for hair and it is counter-productive to put this on hair they should be thankful I gave it three stars.The reason for the three stars is it's ability to help with skin dryness even on my face.  It really is a dry oil no oily residue and moisturizes very nicely.  I have rosecea so the idea of putting an oil on my face made me cringe but my face has been cracking and flaking by midday using my normal moisturizers under my makeup so I gave it a try.I used it sparingly at first but now I am really generous with it on the dry areas of my face and my face has regained its normal appearance and is VERY soft.I have also used it on my body and find that it prevents that dry itch that so often comes with winter much better than Lubriderm or the other lotions I have used.  It absorbs quickly anywhere I use it.  I found using two coats makes it extra effective.I don't care for the scent and it kept my husband from trying it so I recommend they work on that.  Seeing as fragrance was very high up on the list of ingredients I think they could work on that.  The scent doesn't prevent me from using it but if I wore perfume or scented lotion it would be more of an issue.So:.  Do NOT use this on your hair unless you are an actor WANTING to look like you haven't washed your hair in a month or more..  Give it a try on the dry areas of your face..  Use it on your hands and body.Update:  February  I have discovered that it works very well as a makeup remover.  Removes waterproof mascara and semi-permanent eyeliner as well as foundation.  I tested it against Avalon C Face Wash and it removed my foundation at least % better.  If you have particularly dry skin it is terrific.  I usually follow it up with the Avalon C or Ivory soap to remove the excess oil but if you are using a wash cloth you may not need to do that.  I use a baby wipe because terry cloth is too rough and aggravates my rosacea. NOT for hair but works on body and face.,dry skin
Since high school the legs of my shorts have had to be at least . inches.  One-half inch shorter and everyone is invited to view some of the most hideous three inches of cellulite that the backs of two normal sized legs has ever known.  Below the butt and the top of the thighs meet in a violent disruption of the tectonic plates under my skin resulting in anything but a smooth transition.  It doesn't seem to be a part of the rest of me.  In fact I've often wondered if I am not just the life support for that ugly parasitic back-leg disaster.  I exercise.  I always have.  Yet it thrives.I have been using this cream for about - days so far and I do love how it feels going on.  There is a very slight tingle that feels pretty good.  The smell is not perfumey actually smells slightly medicinal but has only the slightest scent at all.  The cream is very thick but absorbs well.Is my cellulite a thing of the past?  No.  However I believe that the hail damage on the thighs has tightened up a bit.  I try to stare it down and although it still wins I can see a slight weakening in its resolve.  If nothing else my skin seems to FEEL tighter.  I am also starting yoga so hopefully I can follow this up with a happily wearing Daisy Dukes ever-after story.I received a free sample for trial.  I was not compelled to write a review.  This is my honest impression of this product.  I receive a lot of test products and I do not hesitate to say if something isn't good. Tightens skin,Neutral
Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak / BDCNBSTI'm a big fan of bath salts so I was happy to receive a free review copy of this product from the manufacturer. I take baths almost nightly and that tends to dry out my skin; I have to be careful what oils or additives I add to the water because my skin is very sensitive to artificial scents and perfumes.These bath salts have a pleasing subtle scent of lavender (not so much to me to be overwhelming though mileage will vary on these things) and are great for moisturizing dry skin. I've used these every night for a couple of weeks now and have had no adverse reaction to the bath salts and I do feel like my legs and feet are softer as a result. I will definitely be buying more of these when this batch runs out.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll Very Soothing,dry skin
I had the opportunity to try Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak and have found my new favorite bath product.The jar contains oz of product.  The instructions indicate to use   cup of product per bath.  The container conveniently has a marking at the oz level making it simple and convenient to measure the correct amount of product.Once in the water the bath salts dissolve quickly.  As a bonus the water remains clear which is always a plus for me.  The difference all natural ingredients make can be immediately seen.  No clouds no artificial colors no perfume overload.  Bath perfection.I was reluctant at first with the lavender fragrance.  One of my least favorite scents and always gives me a headache.  Although the fragrance was somewhat strong in the container it was not artificial or perfumy.  Once dissolved the fragrance was light relaxing and helped temporarily relieved the headache that I did have going into the tub.  As an aside lavender is used  in aromatherapy as a soothing scent.My skin was noticeably soft in the bath.  I didn't use any lotion afterwards and my skin remained soft until my next shower.  Also there was no filmy or oily coating on my skin.  This may be a product that can be used by individuals with sensitive skin. As I the week I used the bath salts I was having a dermatitis reaction to a food allergy.  It actually soothed my skin.Overall this is a wonderful product.  I will be purchasing it in the future.  It is a perfect pick-me-up after a rough week.  I spent an entire hour in the bath tub and exited feeling recharged.  I highly recommend this product. What a difference all natural ingredients makes!!,sensitive skin
These are fantastic bath salts. Let me start with the ingredients:% sea saltVitamin E oilLavender essential oilThis is exactly what I like to see - simple ingredients found in nature. As I went through my cupboard of other bath salts/products I noticed that most had artificial coloring in them and some had other ingredients that I haven't heard of as well. Yuck! When I soak in something for  minutes I want it to be % natural.I also really like the smell. I like lavender in general but there are definitely different varieties of smells that lavender products give off. Some smell like grandmas perfume but these salts smell like the real deal. Floral but with a bit of green-ness to it - nice and refreshing (and relaxing)!Good stuff![Sample provided by manufacturer for review] LOVE it!,Neutral
First the fine print. I was sent a free sample of Beenigma in return for my honest review. Well I;ve been applying Beenigma for a couple of weeks now and I am thrilled. I thought the last moisturizer I tried was amazing but this stuff is even more amazing.First it is rich and thick. Other reviewers said that this is a wipe off treatment. I did not wipe it off I used a smaller amount and rubbed it in very thoroughly. Because of the intensity of this product not to mention the expense I would also suggest using it either in conjunction with another lighter daily moisturizer or as a twice a week intensive moisturizer....the stuff is that rich and that good.For those with issues in terms of perfume there was very light odor to this - nothing that would cause sensitivity or an allergic reaction assuming of course that you aren't allergic to bees - those that are should most likely stay away from this product and the packaging information supports this thesis.How does it work? Well my skin looked and felt younger - both firmer and softer for a start just like skin that is twenty years younger. There was no &#;stinging&#; or reaction when I applied the cream and it felt rich and thick. I think part of the expectation of sting may be the psychological association with bees - but there is nothing but luxury and pleasure in terms of application.Firmer softer lighter are the words I would use to describe my skin after two weeks of use of this product. I don't have a lot of wrinkles but those I do have around the eyes and mouth look lessened to me. As I say above this product is intense and I would suggest using it mixed with a lighter daily moisturizer or as a bi-weekly intensive treatment. I think this would be the best balance between benefit and cost.All in all I was thrilled with this product and I am even considering buying another jar when mine is empty. This product also led me to investigate medicinal honeys from the same part of the world for other health benefits so it was not only a pleasure but an educational experience. Very high recommendation. Wow! This Stuff is the Bomb for Moisture Lightening and Wrinkle Control,Neutral
This review is from: Bee Venom Cream Mask by Beenigma (Misc.)I found this to less effective than I expected in some areas and even more effective than I had hoped for in other areas.This is a fairly heavy creme that is absorbed into the skin quite slowly. It has no smell other than what I assume is the honey and almond oil. It does not interfere with my perfume one bit.Please be very aware that if you don not know if you are allergic to bee stings you may want to first try this with someone in the house if not the same room as you. Sometimes products that contain venom can be nearly fatal to those with very sensitive allergies making ones throat close before you can call for help. Also be aware that allergies can crop up at any time even if you've been stung with no reaction whatsoever in the past.I have been using this twice a day for about a week now and being interested in the unusual I didn't wipe it off after the recommended  minutes. I leave it on the whole day like a moisturizer. However I found by research that this product can be used two ways as a moisturizer OR as a mask.I never experienced any redness or swelling so my fine lines never really looked any plumper or filled in. Well actually they do look a bit reduced in size. Perhaps with more and proper usage they will diminish even more.That was disappointing but I think that if I use this product for more than a week I will see some more results. As far as age spots go since I have been concentrating on specific areas on my face my spots have been over-looked. I will rectify that and add to my review in another two weeks to let you know what I've found out.BUT---what I did find wonderful is that it DID tighten my skin in one very big problem area. I have a turkey wattle...you know that loose crepey skin that makes us (men AND women) look like we have a turkey neck. I have been massaging this into my crepey skin for the same amount of time I have been using it on my smile lines and I'll be damned if my skin isn't getting tighter and less apt to jiggle. I am so thrilled about that. It makes the price of this product well worth it since nothing else I've tried (short of a face lift) has worked on that part of my face. Totally Amazing!I can live with my fine lines but the wattle just creeps me out and the solution come in a little jar. This sample was provided by the manufacturer but I have to tell you if I keep seeing the results I'm seeing on my neck - I WILL be buying this for myself as soon as I run out. It if a very generous jar for the price and a little goes a long way. I think I'm going to be able to get  months out of the one jar.*Sample Provided by Manufacturer*WAY cheaper than a neck-lift! Effective But Different for Me,long way
Killer Queen opens with a rich plum note. I can also make out what I think is raspberry. The plum note is long and distinctive so carries down to the heart of the perfume along with the patchouli. This mixture of plum and patchouli is very similar to Midnight Heat by Beyonce - another Coty release.I'm not familiar with celosia but I don't think it's meant to smell appealing - the fragrance has been compared to that of a skunk online. I guess that Coty just wanted to use the exotic name in the description but used something else in the perfume instead but I can't guess what - I am not able to separate any floral notes from the sweetly powdered floral jumble heart of the fragrance as the praline develops and mixes with the patchouli lasting for the duration of the perfume. I think that the powdered floral mix is extremely similar to Taylor by Taylor Swift overall.There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base thanks to the constant presence of the powdery floral mix and patchouli. The soft creamy praline adds a slight nuttiness so it is a warm comforting mix which does lend a teensy bit of a different air to Killer Queen as it dries down. The final drydown reminds me of La Vie Est Belle so there's nothing new here either.Official scent notes; wild berries plum bergamot Celosia jasmine plumeria cashmere patchouli and liquid praline.***Killer Queen is pleasant and easy to wear but it's just not anything to get excited about. I love perfumes with praline and/or vanilla in but this is &#;meh&#; for me - it reminds me of other perfumes all the way through. I will happily use my bottle as it was given to me as a gift but Killer Queen isn't something that I'd choose to buy for myself.With a new company now in charge of the Katy Perry fragrances Katy promising a new mature image the meaning behind the perfume's name and the marketing campaign for this product I was expecting Killer Queen to be adult a bit more unique and confidently commanding. However the result is still 'young' and unoriginal.Killer Queen doesn't have a unique stamp of it's own to make it stand out from the crowd and it is not something that I'd imagine Katy herself actually wearing. Not great but not bad either...,Neutral
the perfume itself is great but the box came all beaten up! i was afraid that the bottle would be broken! the perfume itself is great but the box came all beaten up,Neutral
I love this stuff.  I would describe it as a very warm mysterious scent.  On my skin the main notes that pop out are the berries plum and patchouli. Smells absolutely delicious and the bottle is just beautiful! I would definitely recommend this to all. GREAT BOTTLE GREAT PERFUME!,Neutral
I love Katy's Purr and her Meow but Kill Queen smells too spicy for me.  It reminds me of Old Spice after shave and I have neverliked that smell.  I gave it to my daughter Laura and she she lliked it so I gave it to her.  So it was okay just not for me. Killer Queen perfume,Neutral
This is a berry fragrance with velvety floral undertones. It's pretty but not super unique or long-lasting. The vial-shaped bottle is actually the best thing about it but I wouldn't buy the perfume just for that reason. Just okay,Neutral
I love this perfume. It smells so good and even my mom thought so too. She's not to crazy about most perfumes so this is good stuff yall. I have many perfumes and so I was happy to add this one to my collection. The bottle looks cool and it arrived fast. Great perfume,Neutral
An excellent fruity lightly floral fragrance that is just right and not overwhelming ever.  I tend to like fruity smells over floral and this one hits the mark.  I buy based upon reviews not the celebrity attached to the perfume.  This one was well-rated on review sites as being fruity and berry.  Love it! May be my new favorite!,Neutral
It is the generic version of Lancme's Vissionnaire at a third of the price!  So far so good the only objectionable thing is the perfume smell in it I do not see why they have to put that in a skin care product! jo jo baltimore,Neutral
I received a sample of this product and will be purchasing more.Unlike most super gentle cleansers this one does not leave your face with a 'unwashed' greasy feel.It is more like a cleansing milk and it dissolves every bit of make-up and grime.But what I really love is the calming soothing lavender scent.When it comes to lavender products some have a slight artificial smell. Not so with this. It's the scent of fresh French lavender and it is heavenly. It does not linger on the skin to interfere with perfumes you might be wearing it's just enough to calm and uplift you while cleansing. Fresh Lavender Scent,Neutral
This is such a great product I am very sensitive to dyes and perfumes that come in a lot of lotions but with this product I did not have to worry...made my skin feel silky smooth Great Product,great product
At first it went on a little greasy but it quickly soaked into my skin. When I woke up the next day my skin still looked moisturized and I didn't have ashy looking legs. I mention this because I live in Las Vegas where it is DRY no humidity here in the desert so suffering dry skin and lips is the norm. I usually use body butter creams from the mall stores. They don't work and are loaded with chemicals and perfume. This % shea butter does the job and heals our skin. NO CHEMICALS. I love it!!! It gets an A+ from me. % natural Rubbing antioxidents on your skin not chemicals.,dry skin
Really nice Shea butter...not your typical moisturizer. It's very very thick and rich. I used it on my dry heals stretch marks and a new scar I have from a small incision and it's too soon to tell about the scar and stretch marks but my dry skin on my heals just soaked it up and they look great so I'm expecting great results for the other areas. It has absolutely no smell at all so no competition with my perfume which I like a lot. Because it's so thick a tiny bit goes a long long way so I'm sure this will last me a long time. Great value. Nice big wide mouth tub with screw top will allow me to use every last drop. Very thick and rich,long way
Although I've been known to splurge at the local LUSH store for premium quality facial soaps it would take a lot of convincing for me to spend $+ on a  oz fash wash. Fortunately I was given a sample bottle to review... and now that I've tasted heaven it will be hard to go back to the cheap stuff.This really is very very good stuff. Part of me wants to give it  stars due to the price tag but it's actually worth it. The texture is just the right amount of creamy and exfoliation with little beads that actually exfoliate but aren't too rough for sensitive skin. The smell is fresh and natural not perfumey and invigorates the senses. I literally feel like I have a new face after I'm done.The directions recommend using it only - times per week which is hard for me to obey since it feels so great however it probably is for the best. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any adverse reactions to it but since it's a very thorough cleanse that would probably be too extreme for the usual twice a day routine.OVERALL: this is a great product that puts a little spa pleasure into the daily facial routine. The ingredients are raw and natural and all are designed to improve the texture and beauty of your skin. I admit the price may be more than what you'd usually expect for a exfoliating facial scrub but it is so worth it. Highly recommended! Pricey But Incredible,great product
Over the last  years I have made demands on my body and backed it up with miracle products. I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy somehow my body got confused - with opposite results so I have flat yet still frizzy hair. In the meantime I'm at that &#;I need a haircut&#; stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it so it's sort of half grown out not long enough for headbands or to hold back not short enough to really be a style just unmanageable.I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy; plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry scoop put on hair run through dry. Easy enough the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.The crown and top of my hair plumped right up and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair and the volume probably increased by a good half.I'm very pleased with the Tono&Guy; (Liked the shampoo too but that's another review) and my plump hair now if my tummy would just get the memo I'd be set. Volume,Neutral
My hair: I have fine blonde hair with a natural wave and it&#;s currently cut in a swing (as short as about  inches in the back and gradually longer until it&#;s just below my chin in the front).The product: I tried it several days in a row as instructed on the package which means that I put a walnut-sized dollop in my palm and worked it into the roots all over my head after towel-drying my hair. I then used a hair dryer on the hottest setting and finished with a &#; straight iron to style. The product did seem to tame my flyaways but only briefly and it gave my hair a bit of volume but only a bit. The biggest problem I had with it was that it made the shorter hair on the back of my head feel greasy so I was worried throughout the day that I was sporting a gross unwashed look from the back.Overall: It&#;s not a bad product. It has a nice scent though subtle enough that my perfume wasn&#;t warring with it and it might work much better on someone with thicker hair than I have. But I certainly wouldn&#;t purchase it again especially not at a premium &#;salon&#; price. Didn&#;t work any better for me than other products I&#;ve tried,Neutral
I have medium length hair that is straight and thick (though the individual texture is fine).  This product does give me some  lift at the root area and adds extra body to my long layers.  As an added bonus it seems to make my hair more shiny looking and gives my rather tired highlights a little boost.  My hair looks full feels soft and there's no sticky product residue.  The fragrance is rather strong and perfume-like but barely noticeable once your hair is dry.How to apply:  This is a creamy product and you don't need to use a lot.  I'd recommend starting with a dime-sized amount.  Rub your palms together to emulsify the product then apply to the root area only - you don't want to distribute this from roots to ends.  Blow dry as usual.On the downside this product is high in alcohol.  While alcohol is a common ingredient in styling products that promise extra body it can be very drying to the hair.  So while I do like the results this is a product that I'll use only occasionally.Bottom Line:  A surprisingly light textured product that provides fullness and extra body though it does contain a lot of potentially drying alcohol.  Not recommended for those who prefer fragrance-free products.  You will need to blow dry in order to see the results. Adds fullness and body but I'd prefer less (drying) alcohol,Neutral
My hair is the salon's nightmare--baby fine short and in desperate need of volume. And I have it colored. Gels are too heavy and weighs my hair down making me look like one of those dolls with a molded plastic head. Sprays and mousses don't have enough hold.This whip has the consistency of a very light hand cream and gives great volume that lasts.Without silicones I don't get a lot of shine but it doesn't collapse like a silicone-filled gel either. As a traveler I appreciate a container that stays shut and doesn't leak.The light pleasant fragrance doesn't compete with my perfume either. A really great product. Perfect for fine colored hair,great product
Light and oil free this moisturizer turned out to be the perfect product for my combination (sometimes acneic) skin. When I woke up the following morning my skin felt moist and plump without feeling any oily residue. It has a nice firming and tightening effect on the skin. I would imagine though that it might not be enough for skin that's oil dry or certain climate conditions that makes the skin parched. The scent was also barely perceptible a feature I prefer over heavily perfumed products. I'd recommend this cream for any age range of skin that tends to be oily or suffer from breakouts or has congestion (blackheads). Perfect for combination skin.,Neutral
dry skin of a post menopause woman ( year old) not so perfect. At my age I am looking for a cream that moisturizes. This makes an excellent daytime treatment for me acting almost like an astringent that I put on after I shower.The list of ingredients would have told me so if I had read them before ordering: Water Glycerin cyclomethicone Betaine Butylene Glycol Cyclopentasiloxane/Dimethicone Polyacrylamide/Laureth-/C- IsoparaffinNiacinamideBeta-Glucan Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Panthenol Hydroxyethylcellulose Allantoin Diazoldinyl Urea/Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate Perfume Perfect for normal to oily skin,dry skin
This moisturizer did make my skin softer. I found it lessened the dry skin around my eyes and did not make me break out.However I have not seen any anti-wrinkling effects yet. I suppose keeping the skin hydrated will in time ease the effects of aging.I like the bottle and the presentation. The solution feels very fresh and inviting not greasy like some moisturizers can be. It feels rather luxurious like a treat to put it on at night. There is no overwhelming perfume or otherwise smell to it which is good because you would smell it all night! The price is pretty reasonable for this sort or product with a brand name. The amount you receive is tolerable and should last for at least a month or two depending on how much you use.I'd recommend someone looking for a product like this to try it out. It's inexpensive enough to try and not suffer buyer's remorse if you don't like it. I would think if you don't like it it would be because it's too light and not from any adverse effects. Pretty Good.,dry skin
This cream works very well.  I put it on and my skin felt smoother.  As it dried it tightened up my skin and left a smooth layer on my face and neck.  Unfortunately I have an allergy to scents and use only fragrance free soaps lotions shampoos and such.  Although the moisturizer's perfume is very light I started to sneeze shortly after I used it.If you don't have this allergy you will be very pleased with it.I recommend it highly. Ellen Tracy Night Time Moisturizer,Neutral
I'm not a big fan of this product. For my skin I think the product is very greasy and I haven't seen any change in my skin. Although I do appreciate the fact that their is no heavy perfume smell to the product it's not the right one for my skin. Not a fan,Neutral
When I first opened the jar I said to myself I'm not going to like this.  I was a bit put off that the cream was actually a gel that looked more like Vicks VapoRub and Vaseline than a cream. I was expecting a white or colored face cream.However it goes on smooth and silky like a cream and has no scent that I could detect. My face immediately felt silky and not tacky like some creams. I also woke up with the same silky feel and have had no bad reaction to this moisturizer as I sometimes have with other products.  I would not claim that this makes my face look younger but it certainly moisturizes well.Ellen Tracy's Nighttime Hydrating Cream is absolutely wonderful from my perspective and the price is extremely reasonable too. I actually just put one of these in my save for later cart so that I can order it when the one I have runs out unless I can find it cheaper at TJ Maxx Tuesday Morning or Home Goods (like some others claim).POSTSCRIPT:  The package says to avoid contact with eyes.Also the ingredients ae Aqua Glycerin Cyclomethicone Betaine Butylene Glycol Cyclopentasiloxane/Dimethicone  Polyacrylamide/Laureth-/C- Isoparaffin Niacinamide Beta-Glucan Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Panthenol Hydroxyethylcellulose Allantoin Diazoldinyl Urea/Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate Perfume.Those who are concerned with the safety of Diazoldinyl Urea or Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate should do their own research. I've come upon articles that say it's safe and others that say differenly. WOW this is a wonderful nighttime hydrating cream,Neutral
I love this night time moisturizer.  It's light and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and leaves my dry skin hydrated.  Best of all it doesn't have a heavy scent. I always buy fragrance free moisturizers because the perfume smells tend to give me a headache.  Even though this cream is not fragrance free I couldn't detect any scent.The directions recommend you use it after applying the Ellen Tracy serum.  I didn't have the Ellen Tracy serum but did use it after I applied e.l.f.'s Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer.  The combination left my skin feeling incredibly soft.  I loved it. Moisture Rich Light and Non-greasy,dry skin
Having some chemistry background may be useful in reading the label of this night cream. I know what aqua and glycerin are but the  next fourteen ingredients were a mystery to me than came the last ingredient perfume.  Had to look them up and do some research. Diazolidinyl urea/iodopropynyl has been banned in Europe according to a Wikipedia posting. The product may not be tested on animals but it apparently has seen some lab time.The thing I liked about the cream is that is is more like a gel light in texture very quickly absorbed not greasy and no fragrance . It worked well made my very dry skin feel soft and silky.  If you believe in better skin through science then this may be just the product for you. I think I will keep looking for something with more natural/organic ingredients that I can read and relate to. Science background may be helpful,dry skin
Pros:+ Easy to use spray+ Does not get the hand sticky nor greasy+ The packing clearly says &#;for MEN&#; so one knows that it does not have a floral perfume.+ Bottle has a matte finish for a better grip in case your hand does somehow get greasy.Cons:- It basically the same product as their usual spray-on sunscreen in their regular orange packaging.We love the spray on sunscreen for reapplying on the go.  My husband loves it for golf so he does not have to take his glove off and does not get his hands greasy.Overall recommended along with their regular spray-on sunscreen. Convenient on-the-go reapplication without the mess.,Neutral
At the time of this review the Banana Boat Triple Defense Spray (for Men!) is listed on Amazon at $. for a single  ounce bottle.It's *sunscreen*.According to the packaging it combats odor and it does indeed have a perfumey but not unpleasant scent.  I tested it out and it seems to work perfectly well as a sunscreen.  Did I smell notably more manly?  Not really but I did at first smell a little floral.  I can't honestly say it combats odor or functioned as an alternative to deodorant.But at the end of the day in a review I like to indicate whether or not I would buy this product and despite it performing as a sunscreen I would *not* buy this based solely on the price.  Why would anyone pay $ for a bottle when I can buy a -pack ofBanana Boat Ultramist SPF  Sport Performance Clear Twinpack  Ouncewith the same SPF rating from the same company (Banana Boat) for $?Bottom line I would not so I mark a functional product down two stars.  I can't say it didn't work I just wouldn't buy it based on alternatives available from the same manufacturer. It's INSANELY overpriced... and it works OK,Neutral
This product is a sufficient for hair cleansing but if you are sensitive to smell...or rather if you cannot tolerate a strong and very long lasting perfume bubble around your head all day this is not the product for you. It is cheap and suitable for the guest bathroom. Strong smell beware,Neutral
This is a good value for this gift set.  It has a perfume like smell that is a little different but I like it.  It does seem to do well on my hair. shine kit,Neutral
I like the FEKKAI APPLE CIDER SHAMPOO. It lathers nicely smells good -- not overpowering or overly perfumey) and rinses cleanly away.My hair and scalp feel clean but I still use a conditioner after it.The one drawback that some people won't like is that it contains Sodium Laureth a chemical that makes the suds and it might irritate sensitive scalps and skin.Also the price is a bit high for shampoo but in its defense I have tried the Fredrick Fekkai Color Technician Glaze Color Protector and it did help keep my dyed hair from fading out. Smells *Great* But *High* Price,Neutral
My wife has been using this hair serum for weeks now and it works pretty well.  A little bit goes a long way.  She puts a few  drops on her palms from the bottle's eyedropper rubs her palms together and then smooths her hair from mid length to ends (her hair is straight full and a bit longer than shoulder length).  This Fekkai oil actually does improve luster and helps to prevent frizz.  I can tell whether she has used it or not and not just because I can smell it.Speaking of smell it has a pleasant aroma like a somewhat warm vanilla.  It isn't floral or like perfume just fragrant.  Whether you like it will be a personal issue.  It releases a substantial fragrance when she first rubs her palms together but the aroma once the oil is in her hair is not so powerful.In all it's a fine product.  It's really expensive and there are other products out there that will deliver similar results for less money.  But if you're looking to pamper yourself this is a good choice for a &#;dry oil&#; hair serum. Expensive but it works,little bit
I usually use John Frieda Frizz Ease serum when I need it and I've had good results with it and have bought it many times but after using this I like it just a bit better.Sometimes when I use the Frizz Ease if I use a little too much then no matter how much a comb/style/blow dry some strands of hair separate like they are &#;greasy&#; and after using this product at least  times now I've not had that problem.I like the packaging of this Fekkai product. It comes in a round cardboard tube that is super easy to open. No wrestling with exacto knives or scissors trying to pry open plastic. Also the bottle is FAB. When you twist the lid to get it off the very top of the lid is a &#;button&#; that pops up as you unscrew the lid.  Attached to the lid there is a dropper and you can depress the button at the top to dispense as little or much as is necessary. Very easy to use and not messy at all.I have hair that is down a few inches past my bra band in the back. Though this bottle is small I found that a little of this goes a long way. I used just under a half a dropper - maybe - drops total - into the palm of my hand rubbed my hands together a little then worked it through my hair starting and the ends and working up. I have oily skin so I don't like to get this (or any styling products really) on the crown of my head because it seems like my hair gets greasy faster so this method works well for me.Sometimes if I wash/blow dry/ flat iron my hair a lot it gets fried looking and this totally takes care of that. It took away all the fly aways and I never had any static cling like I get sometimes when I comb my hair after straightening.I must say that the price of this is more than the Frizz Ease but this bottle seems larger to me and it seems more &#;forgiving&#; if you accidently put a little more on than you meant to. With the Frizz Ease I have actually had to re-wash my hair or use a bit of powder to make the greasies go away and I haven't had to (yet) with this product. Because it doesn't require much and I don't use it daily I think it's worth it to keep it on hand for when I want to have super straight hair without fly aways.One last thing is it really had a lovely scent - delicate and not overpowering so it doesn't compete with your cologne or perfume. My husband could smell it but only if we got really close. . Stars. No Fly Aways No Static. Smooth Shiny Hair.,long way
I have very thick course and naturally curly red hair that tends to frizz.  I picked this up in the hopes that it would help tame the frizzies.  It does a fabulous job.  It also smells great like vanilla and the bottle is very cool.  The dropper lid is very ingenious.  You apply a small amount (dropper full) to dry hair and ta da your hair is gorgeous.Finally I have found a product that works and does not smell like I doused myself in old lady perfume.I recommend. Heaven Scent,Neutral
Love this product. I have coarse wavy hair and would prefer not to use any heat to get it to be smooth and silky. The PRX oil does the trick. I use it about  minutes after towel-drying and combing my damp hair. I place the oil on my palm to warm it and then run it through my hair from mid-length to the ends (especially the ends!) until all the product is gone. And then I comb through my damp hair once more just to make sure the oil is evenly distributed. My hair air-dries and it is frizz-free and smooth.FYI - this contains Argan oil.What I dislike:) It comes with a dropper which I really don't care for because I need WAY MORE product for my damp hair than just the recommended one dropperful. One dropperful might me just right for dry hair.) The smell is a bit strong. It's supposed to be sandalwood and vanilla but it's a bit too musky for my taste. However the perfume does dissipate in time and after four hours I can't really smell it anymore. . Stars,Neutral
I still cannot get over the smell it's amazing!  I'd buy a perfume in a second.  I have baby fine straight untreated dirty blonde hair to my shoulders that starts to go oily on day two.  I usually use dry shampoos for upkeep but in the winter I have so much static build-up I constantly run my finders through my hair and hair looks worse earlier.  I try not to wash more than once every  days but it's tough.I use Fekkai Oil after a shower let the hair dry in a towel and apply after about  hours.  My hair air-dries very fast.  I put some on palms of my hands and let it warm up then run my hands through my hair mostly at ends and mid-section.  I have to say hair smells amazing [how could it not!] and looks great very shiny.  Static is greatly reduced I love it.Note: bottle will leak a bit.  Keep outside round box for storage and when traveling definitely put in a separate bag. Oh My God - the smell is amazing and it's great on my baby fine blonde hair,Neutral
My hair breaks off very easily so I decided to try both the Fekkai Prx Shampoo and Conditioner together as a set to help the condition of my hair.  I have natural blond hair that is baby fine but I have a lot of it.  It has a texture that can sometimes almost be like bleached hair.  This means that it breaks off very easily.  It also tangles easily because it is fine.  I have to use heavy conditioners but I also have to be careful what type I use so that it doesn't look weighed down and greasy.  However if I don't use a &#;strong&#; enough conditioner my hair is very tangly and looks dried out. Another problem I have is that a lot of discount/drug store brands make my scalp flake and itch (but so does ALL Paul Mitchell products so it's not only the cheap stuff).  I need a good shampoo that gets out styling products easily to keep my hair from breaking off.My favorite shampoo has turned out to be Fekkai's Glossing Shampoo.  So that is the shampoo I compare others to.  I didn't like the vanilla scent of this Prx shampoo.  I normally like the clean/fresh or fruity smell in my hair products and perfume.  The Prx shampoo lathered very nicely and rinsed out easily.  I had trouble combing the Prx conditioner through my hair.  I can't be certain if that was a result of the shampoo or the conditioner since I used them several times as a set. My hair looked very dried out when I finished drying it but it did look nice when I fixed it the next morning (I used extra hair oil when styling it).  Because of the good lather and clean rinse-out I am rating the Fekkai Prx shampoo  stars (as opposed to  star for the conditioner) because I can't overlook the fact that I didn't like the smell and my hair was very tangly and difficult to comb out.  A reconstructive shampoo (& conditioner) shouldn't leave your hair all tangly to be broken off when trying to get out the knots. Not a fan of the vanilla smell,Neutral

I keep a wide-toothed comb in my shower to comb through my conditioner.  I had a lot of trouble getting this combed through.  My hair was also very tangly after lightly towel drying it.  It just felt like I was breaking a lot of hair trying to comb it before using a hair dryer.  That would make me think that it definitely wouldn't repair my hair as it is advertised to do but it seems it would do quite the opposite.

I have naturally curly course red hair that tends to frizz in the summer.  That darn humidity and my Irish hair make it tough to have a good hair day in the summer until now.  Normally I wear my hair up in a bun or braided all summer but this stuff works really well.  I used it in my hair while wet then dried and styled as usual  and then worked another dab of it in while dry and it really does help eliminate the frizz.  It's not an all day solution but it does help and you can reapply while dry.  Just a heads up for those that are bothered by this it does have a bit of a perfume-like smell but it smells nice and not too overpowering.I recommend it to anyone who needs a little extra help with their hair during the humid months or just wants to moisturize.  It's rather pricey but it's about the same as what you would pay in a Salon and works just as well if not better in my opinion. Taming of the Frizzies,Neutral
Several years ago I went through a WEN phase until I could no longer afford it.  That stuff is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced!Tried a couple of the Hair One varieties and like them very much (Jojoba version does best on my hair).  But they are still almost double the price of this.  Two bottles of this is about $ (some places you can even find it for $. a bottle) where a liter of Hair One is $ and change if you have the discount card).I also tried the L'Oreal Cleansing Cream and that stuff is GROSS!  The scent was HEAVILY perfumed and it made my hair all matted and tangly when dry.So I jumped in and tried the Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner....it is FABULOUS!  my hair is thin fine almost waist length and stick straight so I have to be careful how heavy shampoos and conditioners are. Yet I also need moisture because my ends are dry. My hair detangled easily when wet and now that it is dry my scalp is clean and fresh and my ends are nicely moisturized.  My hair feels silky yet light as air.  I hope this is never discontinued!!As for the scent it was a bit strong when I was washing but now that it has dried I notice just a light fresh scent in my hair.  I love this!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!,Neutral
This decent conditioner is completely ruined because Herbal Essences decided to throw an entire bottle of flowery smelling perfume into it. It doesn't smell remotely like rosemary or mint. The conditioner itself actually works quite well but it's not worth choking to death in the shower nor smelling it linger around me all day.To be honest this is the first hair care product I've purchased that is going in the trash. I cannot stand to use it. I DO love the Herbal Essences Naked Volume Shampoo. I have no clue why they didn't use the same smell for this. Extremely overpowering smell.,Neutral
Let me start with the good: It makes my hair very soft and clean-looking without feeling stripped. I like that it comes in a pump bottle.The bad: I have fairly long hair (about  feet) and it took me - pumps to coat my hair. After using this only two days I had already used about % of the bottle (so if you do the math it will only last me  days...).Also even though I read the ingredients and didn't think I would have a problem with rosemary peppermint or mint this stuff has a STRONG smell. It seems to get even stronger as the day goes on (is that possible?). I've only used it twice and I've ended up with a migraine both times I've used it.So if you aren't sensitive to scents at all go for it! It's really nice. BUT if you are even the slightest bit sensitive to perfumes or strong smells stay clear of this stuff. I'll be tossing the rest of mine...I don't want to go through another terrible headache. STRONG smell gave me a migraine.,Neutral
I bought this product based on its great smell.  (I was surprised by those who didn't like the scent  or thought it was too strong.  My hair can never smell good enough).  I don't really understand the point of the product however.  I tend to think it's a lazy girl's alternative to a shampoo; you don't rub-a dub-scrub you just put it on and rinse as you do any conditioner; so there is no &#;work&#; involved.  At first I thought that &#;Cleansing Conditioner&#; was just another name for a shampoo with conditioner added but after reading up realized this is really not the case.So I first washed with a shampoo and made this the second step.  I used much too much however stupidly and hair was limp.  I will try again with just several pumps.  I am as you may guess judging the product prematurely.  I will edit my review after the next try.  But God I love the way my hair smells.  Those of you who are older may remember the great smelling shampoos of yester-year:  &#;Enhance&#;  &#;Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific&#; &#;Agree&#; and &#;Lemon-up.&#;  I cannot for the life of me understand why these great products were taken off the market.  But from the reviews here it seems that many people are turned off by fragrance.  I am afraid this product might go the same way as those.  I can't say that I love the fragrance of this Herbal Essence product as well as any of those just mentioned.  It has more of a perfume smell than those I would say but I do love the scent just the same.  (Fragrance would be closest to the &#;Enhance&#;).  But bottom line is this is not a shampoo substitute in my opinion. Not a cleanser,Neutral
Simply Beautiful Age Defy Serum Anti-Wrinkle Face & Neck Cream -Regeneration Anti Aging CreamI'm very neglectful of my skin naughty really as I&#;ve very sensitive skin but I'm lucky in that its pretty good for my age ( +).  I've a bit of a &#;use what's to hand&#; approach which can mean a little olive oil some mornings :) so my skin has had a treat the last three weeks as I&#;ve used this daily.Its in attractive packaging and easy to use from the simple pump dispenser. I find those far better than tubs that you dip fingers into &#; the potential to spread germs with those is high. That then could cause spots so pumps seem a far better idea. Its about the consistency of single cream sort of a transparent white in colour and easily absorbed into skin without any irritation. I've had lots of problems with other creams when my skin has been prickly and red after applications but it was fine with this one.Its got very little scent too which I like heavy clashing products aren't a great idea and I love my perfume to smell as it is without competition from other products! It just has a very faint rose scent to me which goes well with whatever perfume I&#;m wearing. ( Usually Michael Kors or neat essential rose oil). It sinks into skin quickly and doesn't &#;sit&#; like heavier ones do. Its odd but if face creams are too heavy and sit like that I always feel I can't breathe...go figure? I've found in the past lots of creams make my skin very red as does being outside when the wind or sun has a very drying effect so using this cream and it working was a real bonus. Its designed to be used alongside a daily moisturiser but...well... *shrug* I&#;ve already admitted I&#;m not careful with my skin so most days its been this alone and its still been perfect.... My skin feels soft &#; I massage the cream for a minute or so until its soaked in and I'm really pleased with the simplicity of it.Product supplied by sellers. easy to use non irritant,sensitive skin
The instructions on this serum say to apply in the morning either by itself or under your moisturizer. I always wear sunscreen and wearing this plus sunscreen on top is too much product for me so instead I use this at night all by itself. I really don't think it needs another product but of course that's just my skin which has always tended to be more on the oily side even as I get older.The product has a nice consistency and a light floral smell that dissipates quickly which normally I would think was a good thing but I rather like the smell and was trying to figure out what it was. Lilac maybe? It reminds me of those little solid perfume pins that Avon sold when I was a kid (I had one that looked like a gingerbread man.)I did find that this felt a little tingly when applied to my neck but only for a minute.Overall this seems like a good choice for me to use at night before bed but I can't say I suddenly look younger or anything. Maybe I just need to give it more than a few weeks. what's that smell?,Neutral
I've been using this serum both last thing at night and in the morning for a couple of weeks now and I'm really impressed by it.It is claimed that the serum firms brightens and smoothes fine lines and wrinkles and although this is not a miracle product I have certainly seen the benefits of regular use. The serum feels rich yet it is very quickly absorbed by the skin and I only need to use a small amount - so this good sized bottle will last a long time. I use it directly after cleansing not just on my face but over my neck area too.The product smells great lightly perfumed with no chemical tang at all - it smells very natural. The serum leaves no greasy residue and does not need to be massaged into the skin it seems to be absorbed extra quickly this is great as constant rubbing into the skin only drags the fine areas leaving marks.My skin feels much better already I usually suffer with small dry patches in the winter months but these have disappeared. I feel as though my skin is plumper around the mouth and nose area where the lines and wrinkles are usually more prominent.Applying moisturiser and make up immediately after using the product is no problem at all because the serum absorbs so quickly your usual make up products are not affected by this.The packaging is very good. The bottle looks expensive with the frosted inner part and the silver coloured top and bottom. Very nice to have displayed in the bathroom and also small enough to pop into a make up bag or overnight bag without taking up too much room.This product is certainly going to be part of my skin care regime from now on. Easily Absorbed Great for the Skin,long time
Simply Beautiful Enriching Eye Serum Anti-Wrinkle Cream - Regeneration Anti Ageing CreamI'm very neglectful of my skin naughty really as I&#;ve very sensitive skin but I'm lucky in that its pretty good for my age ( +). I've never used a specific eye cream but have used this daily for three weeks now. I've not many wrinkles or lines anyway ( thankfully!!) and applied this above around and below my eyes. It didn't irritate my skin &#; that was good I didn't want any wrinkles or lines smoothed out by red inflamed and puffy irritated skin :) I'd rather stick with the few lines I have....Its in attractive packaging and easy to use from the simple pump dispenser. I find those far better than tubs that you dip fingers into &#; the potential to spread germs in it is high. That then could cause spots so pumps seem a far better idea. Its about the consistency of double cream white in colour and easily absorbed into skin without any irritation. Its got very little scent too which I like heavy clashing products aren't a great idea and I love my perfume to smell as it is without competition from other products! It sinks into skin quickly and doesn't &#;sit&#; like heavier ones do. Its odd but if face creams are too heavy and sit like that I always feel I can't breathe...go figure? It difficult to tell what overall effect this has but it feels good my skin feels soft and I&#;ll happily continue to use it. I've been using it along with the Age Defy serum and they go well together.Product supplied by sellers. excellent product,sensitive skin
Using lotions and creams is somewhat of a foreign concept to me. At  I can count on one hand the number of times that I used makeup; my skin is healthy and thus far I have no wrinkles. With all of that being said one family trait has dogged me since my teenage years a trait that is exacerbated by my insomnia. Dark bags christen my face under my eyes and make me look exhausted (to be fair I usually am...). So when I was given the opportunity to try out this eye serum I jumped at the chance.Simply... Beautiful Enriching Eye Serum is actually closer to a quality lotion in texture. There is a measured pump that is the dispenser; the amount dispensed is the perfect quantity to lightly dab the serum under both eyes. Note that dabbing the serum is critical; rubbing the skin can actually result in darker circles!In terms of absorption the SBEES (for short) does take a few minutes to disappear from under your eyes but not long enough as to pose a problem. After it has been absorbed the skin where it was applied feels soft but there is no residue that I noticed. Other reviewers have indicated that they felt a slight tingling sensation; I never felt any. The product does not have a perfume; there is a slight smell that is similar to that of &#;unscented&#; and/or sensitive-skin formulations of lotions.Does It Work?This is something that I found difficult to gauge. While the skin under my eyes is definitely softer the dark circles are still there. What I can say is that any &#;bagginess&#; (e.g. &#;bags under the eyes&#;) did start to fade during the second week of daily use. By week three the puffiness was gone and the dark circles were toned down a bit but still obvious. So while the serum is capable of reducing puffiness under the eyes the bruising from lack of sleep will still show. Fortunately there is a thing called &#;eye concealer&#; that I can apply after using the SBEES to hide those dark circles!Final SayWhile I have only been using this product for roughly a month I can attest that it will reduce puffy eyes. In terms of wrinkles since the serum works by &#;tightening&#; your skin it would logically make sense that reducing the bags under your eyes by pulling your skin taut would result in the reduction of wrinkles also. If you have dark circles that grace your eyes the serum will help a bit but ultimately you will need to use a concealer product and/or other method to hide them.Finally the serum does make the skin around your eyes feel silky smooth doesn't have an odor which could irritate the skin and the pump on the bottle dispenses exactly enough product to use for both eyes. Since one pump provides enough serum for both eyes the . fl oz. bottle will last you quite a while. As I mentioned prior even with daily use over a month I have barely tapped the amount of serum that is in the Simply... Beautiful bottle. Thus with everything taken into account I feel confident recommending this product for you or as a gift for a friend. Then in a few weeks time you will see the marvelous change in the skin around your eyes!**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

I was provided a sample product for review.  This is my honest opinion.This smells like an Orange Juiius to me if you've had one of those.  The scent reminds me of citrus and vanilla.  It is very pleasant.  I'd wear it for a perfume if they'd make one.  It's quite yummy.  To me it is not too strong but if you don't like scent this might be one to skip. It is a very natural scent though.It has several beneficial ingredients including Vitamin C (%) and Vitamins A and E.  It also has salicylic acid in it all in a cyclomethicone base which is an artificial silicone base that works as a carrier to get the good stuff to the skin.  Because of this it feels super silky going on and helps the serum spread very easily.  It immediately helps plump up small fine lines under my eyes so I've enjoyed applying it prior to my makeup.The pump works great giving a nice dose that's all I need but I enjoy applying it so much I usually use another pump or two.  It has this silky feel - a lot like Estee Lauders Ceramide capsules if you've ever used those.  It's not the same ingredients but it FEELS a lot like those.  I have been following mine with Clinique's All Day moisturizer with SPF .  I have not had any redness with this regimen.I'm quite pleased with it.  My skin rarely if ever breaks out at all though - people prone to breakouts might have issues with the cyclomethicone  thought the salicylic acid might be enough to counter that so I won't recommend it for them but on my aging skin that is clear this has helped keep my skin tone even and help plump up small fine lines. Feels very silky plumps wrinkles,Neutral
I have been using this product as instructed for between three and four weeks. So far no new hair but the package states that it may take six weeks or longer. On the plus side I've experienced no allergic response which is amazing as I react to many perfumes dyes and topical medications. It comes with its own dropper and is quite easy to apply. Awaiting results,Neutral
I just started using this Pura D&#;Or Argan Oil Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo with gold label AFTER using the Pura d&#;Or Argan Oil Shampoo with the blue label for several months.  I could not figure out why this shampoo (with gold label) was so much more expensive than the other formula but I must admit this seemed to make my hair much more manageable than the other shampoo.  This shampoo like their other formula works to help prevent hair loss.  There are no SLS no harmful Parabens and no harsh chemicals.  It is safe for color treated hair.  You only need about  pumps to get a good lather.  The consistency is a bit thinner than other shampoos but it does an excellent job of cleaning the hair.  I liked that there are no heavy perfumes.  The shampoo has a slightly medicinal smell and I noticed natural smells of mint citrus and a slight woodsy aroma.  This smell was not unpleasant and after rinsing and using conditioner I did not detect any medicinal smell at all.  What I did notice was my hair was very soft and manageable after using this product.  Much more so than when I was using the Pura D&#;Or with the blue label.  Overall I have noticed less hair loss since using the Pura D&#;Or line and I would recommend this shampoo for men and women.  After using this gold label shampoo I will stick with it because I liked the results over the blue label formula. A great shampoo for men and women!,argan oil
I tried this product on my arm first and I'm glad I did. The scent was strong and long-lasting a sort of floral/tropical smell that is not exactly awful but definitely not something I want on my face all day. I don't know why they would put such a strong perfume in a product that's meant to be used on your face. For one thing perfumes can be skin irritants; for another your nose is right there. Smelling it. All day.If you like the scent and don't have sensitive skin this is probably an OK product. Strong Scent,sensitive skin
This particular lotion comes in a very convenient bottle with an easy pump. The lotion itself looks appealing with the stripes in it. Now the smell is very perfume-y... reminds me of other Hawaiian Tropic items but has an even stronger smell. This will either be a hit or miss for each person. For me it doesn't smell bad but maybe just a bit much.I used this and it is definitely not oily as advertised. In fact I don't feel like it really moisturized my skin. There is one spot on my cheek that's a bit dry and it still feels slightly dry after using this. It seem to have been moisturized only a little bit.Also this is advertised to last  hours but lasted for me maybe at max  hours.This was so-so for me and the biggest pro this has going for it is the fact that it is not greasy or oily. It is far from natural if you're looking for a more natural lotion. This does do a decent job just seem like it's not for extremely dry skin. So so face lotion,dry skin
If you like the luster that a good hair oil can bring to your locks but still aren't crazy about an oil's slick texture Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is an ideal solution.Just a little bit of this nice lightweight cream melts into the air and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny and healthy thanks to its olive oil formula and its smells really nice too with a pleasant floral scent that isn't too perfume-y.And although it's on the pricier side the -oz container lasts a long time since just a small amount goes a very long way--resist the temptation to squeeze out as much as you'd normally use with cheaper stuff or it will leave your hair looking greasy. A little dab will do the trick--giving your hair a notable shine without oil.,little bit
This shampoo has a strong perfume. To me it's a strong peach smell. Once lathered up I noticed the mint. It's really a lovely smell but appreciation of scent is a subjective thing.I was surprised at how much lather I had using the same amount as my normal (high end drugstore) shampoo.Did the shampoo add body and fullness to my hair? Not that I could notice. I can't say this is better or worse than any other good shampoo. Nice,Neutral
I started out by using the Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner and that worked out so well (please see my product review) that I jumped at the opportunity to try the shampoo.  Same excellent results.Once again this is not a cheap product.  I know that a lot of people think that shampoos are all the same.  Wrong. I have color treated hair and I can tell you that there are many many bad choices out there that will not only strip your color but also leave your hair looking dried out and unhealthy. This is not one of those shampoos.I use a very small amount since it lathers really well. The smell isn't bad but since we're talking shampoo and not perfume this is definitely not a deal breaker for me. All I care about is how my hair looks.  And so far between using both the shampoo and the conditioner my color is still fresh my hair is healthy and I haven't experienced any kind of alergic reaction to the ingredients in the bottle (big concern of mine).Yes it is expensive compared to other brands out there. But if you're in the market for something that won't make your hair look like a limp colorless blob - I think you might be happy with Fekkai. Great Shampoo for Color Treated Hair,Neutral
I do have color treated hair and I had actually used the last of the color-safe shampoo I've been using for years so was glad to get a chance to try something new. I do like the texture and feel of this on my hair and I especially like the way the dispenser is designed very easy to pop open pour out what you need and snap it shut tight again. There is a slight scent to the shampoo but not overly strong or one that lingers long afterwards (a plus for this perfume sensitive girl). No complaints here,Neutral
A truly wonderful conditioner. Really does what it promises with no residue or build up left on hair.When applying it is not thick or heavy but light and easy to rinse off.Smells like a herbal shampoo to me when applied but when hair is dry it just smells clean with no heavy perfumes.My hair is very fine dry and coloured but this leaves my hair silky smooth with lots of lift and volume.Great product will be using again and looking for others in this line. Smooth Silky Volume,Neutral
My  star review may be a result of my particular hair type and not as much the fault of the product.  I am  and my baby fine naturally curly hair has always been difficult and has gotten worse as I've gotten older (I also live where the summers are very humid).  I have tried a whole series of shampoo/conditioners to try and reclaim some of the softness and shine it had.  So far  the best combination I've found has been Pantene Damage Detox shampoo with L'oreal Total Repair.  I don't think I'll switch again.  I thought I'd give this one a try but it didn't work well for me.  At first I liked it as my hair felt soft and wasn't very frizzy but the more I used it the more coated my hair felt until I had to quit using it.  I just didn't like they way my hair felt.  It seemed to weigh by hair down too much also.  I never did see much difference in the shine either.On the good side a little bit goes a long way if you add water to your hands and rub them together.  It doesn't &#;activate&#; until you do.  The suds are rich and nice.  The fragrance is a tad strong but then I'm very sensitive to perfumes.I think for someone with thicker hair with average body and not curl this would be a good product. Lovely shampoo but not for me,little bit
I initially thought this Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner would turn out to be a very heavy masque-like conditioner.  I have natural blond hair that is baby fine but I have a lot of it.  It has a texture that can sometimes almost be like bleached hair.  This means that it breaks off very easily.  It also tangles easily because it is fine.  I have to use deep conditioners several times a week but I also have to be carefule what type I use so that it doesn't look weighed down and greasy.  However if I don't use a &#;strong&#; enough conditioner my hair is very tangly and looks dried out. Another problem I have is that a lot of discount/drug store brands make my scalp flake and itch (but so does ALL Paul Mitchell products so it's not only the cheap stuff).I have tried many many different conditioners over the years.  My favorite has turned out to be Fekkai's Glossing Conditioner.  So that is the conditioner I compare others to.  I didn't think I would like the floral scent of this Shea conditioner.  I normally like the clean/fresh or fruity smell in my hair products and perfume.  Fekkai Shea Conditioner's floral smell is amazing!!!  I caught myself the day after using it (wash my hair at night) swinging my head around so that I could catch a light whiff of it.  The conditioner definitely didn't give me a deep deep condition like I thought it would.  I found that I had to use a LOT more of it than the Glossing conditioner to be able to get out my tangles.  I keep a wide-toothed comb in my shower to comb through my conditioner.  I had a lot of trouble getting this combed through.  My hair did look very nice when I fixed it the next day though.In summary -- I LOVE the smell of Fekkai Shea Conditioner and my hair looked nice when I fixed it the day after using this conditioner but I had to use way too much of the product to get a comb through my hair.  If you don't have hair that tangles extremely easily then you should try this conditioner.  If you have tangly hair then I wouldn't recommend it. Smells great,Neutral
I know what wonders Shea Butter does for my skin but I was concerned that it would be too much for my hair.  Wrong!Fekkai Essetial Shea Conditioner is just what my coarse dry hair needed.  Shampoos/condtioners are much like perfumes and ice cream sundaes.  Taste and personal preference play a big part in an evaluation.  So I can only assure potential buyers that the product works for me.I have fly-away hair that seems to want to stand straight up from my head and salute passers by.  grrrrThe Fekkai Shea Conditioner seems to have tamed it.  It's now soft and smooth and it stays in the general area that I want it.  No more salutes.  It feels smooth and good to the touch.And equally positive it's not heavy and over-conditioned.  I modestly say that it looks better than usual.The scent is a light jasmine; I like it but again it's personal preference. It tamed my fly-away strands....,Neutral
Silky not perfumey glides across your skin leaving you feeling soft and supple all over. I finished using my last bar so I'm ordering more!!! Love this soap!!! Best Soap I've Used!!!,Neutral
I had wanted to try this for some time but was hesitant due to the price. I finally gave in and bought it locally for $. I bought the color Mauve Mystique. The color is much more sheer than I thought. Basically it is like a light wash of color. The odd thing though is that it feels very thick and heavy on you lips. So basically it has the feel of liquid lipstick but only the color of a gloss. It is a pretty effect but not quite what I was expecting. The thing I really cannot get over is the smell/taste. Basically it smells and tastes like a very strong floral perfume. I am very sensitive to smells and I just cannot get over this. It is sad because I think with a few tweaks this could be an amazing product....but as it is....I would not recommend it nor would I purchase it again. Pretty Color but wierd smell and taste,Neutral
Argan oil is a little-known secret for beautiful hair and skin although it is gaining in popularity in shampoos and conditioners.  Unfortunately most products that contain Argan oil don't mention where it was harvested or how pure it is or even how much of the oil is added to the product.Uni Argan oil is fresh pure and % oil and it's even certified by the USDA and ECOCERT (an international organization that tests and certifies organic products).  I go out of my way to use natural organic products whenever possible and I love knowing that this oil is good for my skin and hair.I apply a few drops to my dry elbows and legs after I shower and it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.  It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy spot to stain my clothes.  After I shampoo my hair and towel dry I apply just a drop or two to my hands rub them together and then run my hands through my hair.  This tiny bit of oil gives my hair a noticeable shine and helps control my frizzies.  I have fine curly hair so I have to be careful not to apply too much oil but I love the way this oil makes my hair look.  When first applied this oil it has a very faint nut-like scent.  After a few minutes I can't detect any scent so it's not fighting with my perfume or other hair products.I've bought other brands of Argan oil in the past but when comparing price and purity this is the best one I've used.  I received a complimentary sample of Uni Pure Moroccan Argan Oil in exchange for writing an honest review. Excellent all-natural moisturizing for hair or skin,argan oil
This bottle is twice the size and half the price (or less) than argan I was buying at Ulta. Plus it doesn't have perfume added to it like that stuff did...I love this most for my hair. I recently removed all the dye from my hair and that of course fried it but this oil makes it look presentable. I also put a few drops in my palms and run through the ends before flat ironing (after using a spray like Kenra leave in) and it's helping to make my hair look normal and not dry.Lots of people use this for skin also I use other things right now but I've used this successfully as a post-wax and post-peel soothing treatment and it really works. I will be using this as my go-to argan oil from now on. Can't beat the price. Love it and less expensive than others,argan oil
I received a request from Unipurity to review their Pure Moroccan Argan Oil  I had just been to my dermatologist and we had discussed my dry skin and itchy scalp.  The timing was perfect.  They sent me a promo code so I could purchase it on Amazon at no cost to me.I told them that I was really wanting it for my hair and scalp.  They sent me some additional directions. Before you put it in your hair you need to wet your hair.  Put the oil in the palm of your hand to warm it and then apply.  I did that  and it took about  droperfuls of the oil.  My hair is short.  They then said to wrap your hair in plastic or a towel and to wait about an hour to wash your hair.  They said it could be left in over night but that didn't appeal to me.  I wrapped it in a towel and then did my walking on my treadmill.  I then showered and used Nioxin to wash and condition my hair.  When I got out of the shower I applied more oil to my feet legs and arms.  I really do not like greasy feeling things.  I noticed that my legs and arms felt a bit greasy but the more I thought about it I think they are just not feeling dry and flakey and that is a new feeling for me.My scalp is still itchy but my hair feels very soft.  I went to my hairdresser's today and asked her if she could tell a difference.  She agrees that it feels softer.  As she wet it to wash it she said it does feel like I have a product in my hair which she knows I do not do.  When she used the shampoo she said it lathered immediately.  She said if there is something oily in your hair it doesn't lather very well with the first wash but that wasn't the cast with this.My feet ankles and heels were very dry.  Having applied this oil  times there is a big difference.  They don't feel dry and flakey any more.  Hopefully this will mean they will also not be as itchy.  My hairdress did suggest that some of the scalp itching could be due to the extreme weather changes we have been having.  If I find an improvement with that I will update my review.Unipurity also mentioned that some do not like the smell but if you got an oil that didn't smell like this is has been heat treated.  I was not bothered by the smell.  It isn't a fragrance you would want for a perfume but it also doesn't make you recoil when you smell it. Came when I needed it most.,argan oil
As you may have noticed argan oil has crept into the American marketplace as the latest fad for the health of your skin and hair. While I have seen more products in the hair care aisle there are a few manufacturers who have included argan oil into their lotions and creams. While all of these options are a matter of personal preference there is yet a third option available to those who are curious about the &#;powers&#; of oil from the Argania Spinosa plant; UNi  Purity % Organic Moroccan Argan Oil is available in a conveniently-sized ml/ fluid oz glass bottle for those wanting to test its effects through a pure concentration.Packaging and UseThe UNi Argan Oil (henceforth referred to as UAO) comes in a glass bottle with a glass eye dropper for the top. Due to this you should take extra care to ensure that the glass tube doesn&#;t end up in the mouth of kids or pets. Safety concerns aside using an eye dropper to dispense the oil has advantages one being able to consistently measure a specific amount of liquid to use. The other advantage is that the eye dropper method makes it much neater to apply the oil directly to your scalp; rather than having to pour the oil and risk using too much or making a mess you can simply squeeze a small amount exactly where you want the argan oil to go.Argan oil itself doesn&#;t have much of an odor. If you had to describe its perfume I would venture that it is a subtle mix of being earthy and musky. There are no additives to the UAO product so the scent that it has is that being released by the plant itself. Due to this mild fragrance I was able to use the oil in my hair and didn&#;t have to worry about it overpowering my perfume.EfficacyWhile the benefits may vary I found that over the course of a month the argan oil did help my hair scalp and hands immensely. First my hair; I am very much a &#;throw it in a ponytail and hit the town&#; kind of gal. I do wear perfume but that is about the extent of my beauty regimen. After testing the oil in an inconspicuous area to ensure that I was not allergic to it I set up a routine: one eye dropper-full in the morning and one at night after my shower. I applied the oil directly to my scalp and slowly massaged it in. That is when I discovered the following:) A little bit goes a long way. While this is great in terms of value for the price the downside is that it can leave your hair looking a touch greasy if you do not massage it in well.) It smoothed my split ends and definitely boosted my dried-out hair which is great with all the dried heat from the furnace and the heavy water in my area.All of this impressed me. I used it every day but after my initial two-week assessment I discovered that I could get away with using it every few days instead and still get the same results. The properties of this purified oil hold up to your daily hair routine for several days before you need to replenish!Now what about skin? Good news dear reader UAO is also great for smoothing dry flaky skin especially when it is caused by the aforementioned winter evilness. Simply squeeze a small amount (a dot the size of a quarter is usually good for both hands) and rub the oil in to moisturize both your skin and nails.That being said there is one downside to this product that forces me to deduct a star. While I love the moisturizing capabilities and the lack of a scent as oil it is greasy. If you use it on your hands especially you will find that a thin coating of the UAO will remain on your skin for a few minutes until it is completely absorbed. As a result I one time rested my hand on a nice shirt and left a nice grease stain that hasn&#;t come out. You want to either use a paper towel to &#;blot&#; the rest or wait until you can successfully snap your fingers again. Otherwise you run the risk of not only staining clothes but dropping full cans of pop onto the carpet as it slips from your grasp.OverallUNi Purity % Organic Moroccan Argan Oil is a great little beauty secret that can help both your hair and skin leaving them beautifully moisturized and ready to tackle the world. Your hair will be shinier your scalp healthier and your skin less-damaged from your daily activities. With the capability to be used every day or once a week you have the flexibility to use this Argan Oil when you want to. Over time you may even discover that it has replaced other more costly hair and/or skin care items.With the only downsides to UAO being the glass bottle & eye dropper (which could be damaged by kiddies or curious cats) and the fact that it may leave grease stains on fabric if you do not wait until it is fully dry I feel confident in recommending this product to you as a very flexible addition to your beauty regimen.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

Hi this is Terry's wife.  I'm the one who ordered the face cream.  I find it's thicker than most other creams I've used and has a strong flowery fragrance that reminds me of jasmine perfume.  The fragrance lasted throughout the work day and the cream has left my skin soft and smooth.  It's been  hours since I applied it and I'm amazed that my face still feels this nice.  It's like I just had a spa facial! Leaves my skin smooth,Neutral
This is an all natural hand soap.It only takes a small amount of this product to work so there is no need to press the pump all the way downward.  This liquid soap is not thick it is thin.What I like about this soap is that it does not dry out my hands like my antibacterial soap does.  I have sensitive skin and this product does NOT irritate my hands.What I dislike about this soap is the smell. The smell is not bad - it is just not my favorite smell. Fortunately the smell is subtle so I am not walking around smelling like lavender and vanilla perfume.  I have to be careful with loud smells because of allergies - I do not have that problem with this soap. Gentle moisturizing soap,Neutral

I have layered fine naturally wavy hair.  I can style it either straight or curly.  I normally use hair gel on the ends of my damp hair before blow drying it but I decided to try this instead of the gel.I like it!  I was expecting it to be a very thick product that would make my hair so smooth that it would fall flat.  But my hair got very nice volume and my waves/curls have definition and are not frizzy.  There's a nice shine to my hair.  I actually like it better than the hair gel I have been using.  I'm sure it will work great when I straighten my hair as well.I also tried it on my daughter whose hair is similar to mine and it took away her frizzies and flyaways as well.The only negative thing I would say is that I used more of this than I expected to.  It just soaked into my hair and I had to reapply.  So I'm going to use this up faster than I expected.  Also it has a perfume/cologne scent to it.  I have a few friends who have allergies to scents so I do not wear perfume.  I'm a little worried that the scent of my hair might bother their allergies.I would definitely recommend this product it does what it claims to do. Lightweight control curl definition and shine!,Neutral
This is great.  It's naturally scented smells like flowers it's very mild on the skin.I really like it!  Not heavy or greasy and it does seem to be doing what it states. :-)  I've been using it about a month and a half now... so not the full  weeks yet.

Stroll down your local grocery or any store with lots of hair and makeup choices no matter where you are and no doubt you will be struck by the amount of products claiming to contain Argan oil. Why? Consumers are demanding it the more they read and learn and watch on TV about it...studies have shown this does things as an ingredient few others can and it's all-natural.The problem is that if you get it in the store you really don't know how much you are getting in the shampoo or conditioner--even if there are  other oils or ingredients after it so it's higher up on the list that could mean there is a minuscule amount of each all the same minuscule amount.So it's far better to give your hair and skin the benefits of this wonderful oil and know how much you are getting...you will see the difference.So what does it do?Have you see Avatar and the &#;Tree of Life&#;? That is actually what the Moroccans call the Argan tree. Argan oil is produced from the kernels of the tree and is one of the rarest oils in the world. The women in the region where the tree is native there have used Argan oil for centuries to protect and nourish their skin hair and nails from the harsh conditions in which they live. Now read a beauty magazine or a medical study or turn on the TV and you may hear this called even here in the US a &#;miracle ingredient&#; in the Western beauty product industry. It has extremely high levels of Vitamin E and % fatty acids which make it perfect for healing many skin ailments as well as protecting against premature aging caused by oxidation.Healing and ProtectingThe triterpenoids that occur naturally in Argan Oil offer amazing skin protection benefits. It is used for tissue healing (scars) anti-inflammatory sun-protective and disinfectant properties.The oil contains % unsaturated fatty acids and contains .% unsaponifiables (a large group of compounds also known as plant sterols or sterolins). These nurturing ingredients support skin metabolism reduce inflammation and promote moisture retention.Anti-agingArgan is often found in cosmetics for an anti-aging oil due to properties such as the high levels of vitamin E /tocopherols (anti-oxidants help neutralise free radical damage which is important for skin exposed to our harsh and polluted environments) and saponins (skin-softening agents). Besides cooling and soothing inflammation it is said to help reduce wrinkles by restoring the skin`s hydro-lipid layer.Medicinal PropertiesIt's a natural anti-inflammatory and the oil is considered highly beneficial for arthritic or rheumatic conditions in naturopathic medicine.It is helpful for lowering cholesterol levels stimulating circulation and strengthening the body`s natural immunity.It is used to soothe skin ailments like chickenpox acne psoriasis and dry eczema. It is also used to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.And hey gang traditionally Argan oil is also reputed to have aphrodisiac and tonic properties.I'm not commenting on that though...you decide.So what I like to do is before I go to bed put some drops on my hand and rub through my hair so my strands get nurturing all night long then I rub my hands on my face and neck. The bonus is that is also nourishes your nails when thou do this.You will be surprised that your skin will feel better no lotion needed.The scent isn't exactly flowery...I would not use it during a night of romance for example without perfume in my hair as well. It's not a strong smell though likely no one would even notice it's in your hair.I also sometimes use it after the shower and just leave in my hair all day. It tames frizzes and adds shine while helping with repair and moisturization as wellIt's the miracle ingredient now in cosmetics..and as old as these trees grow (I think it was around  years) you know they have something inside that is a preventative for damage to allow that tree to do just that--and with the Argan oil you get a derivative without chopping down a thing.Does it work?  Yes it does...the shine in my hair the smoothness of my skin and the growth of my nails says so.And this is pure Argan not cut with another oil as is often the case.Oil provided by LT Organics.  Review is my honest and unbiased opinion. Nourish your hair and skin and nails--all in one product.,argan oil
This does add some rich dark tone to my hair and it also puts in some life back to faded out color but as far as adding shine forget it.  It add zero shine.  I put this in and leave it on for the recommended three minutes in the shower.  It does not stain my hands at all.This has a strong perfume fragrance that lingers in my hair for about an hour after I dry it. It isn't a nice perfume either.When I dry my hair I do see a slight improvement in the tone.  It is deeper and has some added golden brown instead of it's previous faded out color.  But it is slightly drying and makes my hair even more frizzy than it was if I hadn't used this.  I feel this is bad for the condition of my hair and for the small amount of color improvement and lack of the advertised shine it isn't worth the effort.  I had to use two different after drying smoothing creams on my  hair to get it to not look as frizzy and damaged as it did after using this.  I would rather color my hair more often than use this due to the frizz this creates. Adds Tone,Neutral
I opened the container of John Frieda hair color and got immediately nauseous from the sickly sweet chemical smell. No way was I going to try it! So I threw it out. This may work wonderfully; but the smell is a barrier I wouldn't cross. If you don't like overly perfumed products do not try. Threw Out Because of Smell,Neutral
This review is for the John Frieda Glosser in Warm Red.The Glosser does not foam.  John Frieda makes a permanent hair color that does foam.  This is not that product.I have coppery red hair that without color refreshing of some sort reverts to medium drab blond/light brownish.  Blah.I have used many color depositing conditioners (including John Frieda's conditioner for red hair) and they tend to be hit or miss and I wind up having to use them every single shampoo.  That's not a big deal for some but as they all tend to be very perfumed and I am very sensitive to perfumes and additives it is a big deal for me.Glosser has surprisingly minimal ingredients.  The fragrance is less pervasive than John Frieda's conditioning and shampoo products but it is similar- vaguely floral and a bit powdery and perfumey but not freshly dyed in fragrance.  Once hair is dry it does persist but it definitely more muted and likely will meld with any other styling products.The color is pretty good.  I use Glosser a couple of times a week and really love how natural it makes my particular warm red/copper color hold up but also shine.I do have extremely thick hair that borders on coarse and I have more than a couple of greys coming in these days (I call my hair copper and platinum).  This doesn't color or cover the grays but it adds a lovely sheen to all hair which makes it look more modern and youthful at least on my hair.  It does rub off just a little on white towels while hair is wet.My hair does feel smoother sleeker and less bouncy after using this.  It just seems to take some of the body out of it but after the next wash my hair is back to perfect.  For the lower body days I use big curlers or a blow dryer and diffuser while I am usually a towel dry clip and go sort of a girl. Coppery reds YES!,Neutral
This in the shade called &#;Cool Blond&#; is a purple liquid that toned down all gold in my hair.  I had actually used L'Oreal Excellence Golden Blond about a month ago and for a couple of weeks had a really gorgeous gold/blond shade which then faded out into a nondescript general blond color.  It never did become a brassy color just faded.I wanted to see what this cool blond shade would do for my hair.  I put this on in the shower after conditioning as the directions indicated.  I left it on about four minutes one minute longer than directed.  I noticed a heavy perfume in this even before I squirted it out of the bottle.  This rinsed easily and I saw zero tint on my hands from it.This did take all trace of gold and yellow out of my hair leaving me with a really unattractive wheat color.  I could still smell the unpleasant fragrance in my hair for up to an hour after drying it.  My hair felt dry and was very frizzy and there was absolutely no shine.What I can recommend this for is someone with hair in reasonably good condition who wants to take the yellow or brass color out of dyed blond hair. Don't expect any shine from this. You don't need to use this more than once to see results but the results are not wonderful just slightly ok.  This says to use a quarter sized amount on the top third of your hair another quarter sized amount in the middle area and another quarter sized amount on the ends.  I think some people are confusing the instructions to mean to use it three times before you see any results which is not correct.  Anyway this is not something I would use again unless I wanted a toner to tone down brassiness in blond hair. Purple to Tone Down Brassines,Neutral
I have my hair highlighted at a salon about once every -weeks. My stylist uses a purple peroxide and golden highlight combination and leaves some of my underside the darker brown of my natural hair. I did this rinse after  weeks of my coloring when the roots are beginning to get darkish and the color is fading. I used gloves to apply to wet hair--and noticed it didn't foam up but was rather a gel. I left it on  minutes and rinsed. VERY heavy smell to this. Not unpleasant but very perfumed so if you are sensitive to smell this is not for you.  As for the color. I did notice a small change in my mid highlights (I used cool blonde). My lighter color remained the same and it did nothing for my roots (which it wouldn't because of no lightener in the rinse). My hair felt nice but as for a real color &#;boost&#; it wasn't enough for me to want to buy another bottle. Mixed Results,Neutral

I didn't like this product not at all.  The smell was very unattractive ( like when they squirt perfume on you in a department store) and overwhelmed any other fragrances in my shower.  The texture was hard to work with.  My hair is very very short less than  inches in length and I still had trouble working the product along the strands for even coverage.  I also was very careful to apply this exactly as instructed and to wait the full amount of time to rinse it out.  My light brown hair didn't pick up any additional red tones at all under indoor lighting of several types.  I also get some gray showing between coloring says that hair doesn't hold the color quite as well.  I expected to be able to see some indication of this glosser's shade on that grey. Nope none.  I've used other between coloring glosser's so I know what to expect.  This one was a great idea and simple to use in the shower but the results fell far short.  To be fair I only used this once.  Is possible that weekly applications would build up some color over time but I prefer natural aromatherapy smells and cheap perfume smell in this was just too off putting to continue. Thumbs down on this one. Nope,Neutral

I really gave this stuff a full try.  I used it as directed every day for a week and I gotta say I'm not impressed.  I didn't notice anything at all with the first application and nothing dramatic after  days.It has a very light sweet perfume scent nothing strong so on the plus side it probably would not compete with perfume.  The real downside however was that it was not as moisturizing or smoothing as my current body lotion (&#;Amazing Grace&#; by Philosophy - makes my skin really smooth and moisturized all day long and since I don't wear perfume I love the smell). I didn't notice anything at all with the first application and nothing dramatic after  days.,Neutral
I have been using this cream for about two weeks now and I like it.  I wouldn't say it's any kind of miracle-worker but I like the fact that it makes your skin feel softer immediately and the color (it looks like cream face makeup) blends quickly into my skin.  It does not look fake or mask-like.  I don't know how long you would have to use this to result in fading age spots-- I haven't noticed any changes yet.  Overall I think it's a good body cream.I would only offer up two possible concerns for some consumers.  First it is scented-- it has a relatively mild perfume-y smell. It's not bad but if you're sensitive to scents I would find another product.  Also it stings a little if your skin is chapped.  At the time of this writing the temperature outside is below freezing and my hands have been more chapped than usual which is how I noticed the stinging.  The stinging sensation disappears within a minute or so but my assumption is that this might irritate more sensitive skin.  And it did repair my chapped skin so I have continued to use it.If you're in the market for a good all-purpose BB cream and don't have overly sensitive skin this product should work well for you. Good quality BB cream,sensitive skin
I suspected right away that I might have trouble with this cream-- as soon as I spread it on my hands (which are so dried out around the knuckles that they bleed sometimes) I was overpowered by the scent. Sometimes a scent just smells strong when you first put it on though and then it dissipates quickly. I hoped that would be the case because it felt great.The cream was rich and very moisturizing and it lasted several hours before my hands began feeling dry again but it did trigger a migraine. If you're prone to migraines triggered by perfumes and fragrances this is probably not the cream for you. That's too bad because it was otherwise very nice and absorbed well. Scent triggered a migraine,Neutral
This stuff does nothing for my skin beyond short-lived hydration... That's no surprise considering the cheap ingredients (petroleum dimethicone mineral oil etc.).The smell is artificial but luckily not too strong. The cream goes on smoothly and feels a little greasy initially. It has a tint to it that is lighter than my skin but after application my hands are a light brownish-reddish color that lasts for hours (from the DHA or dihydroxyacetone). However the bronzing effect is weak because on my legs and arms I see no difference in color as I would with a regular sunless-tanner which would probably have a higher percentage of DHA. It's kind of like watered down self-tanning lotion.There is no magical perfection of the skin.After the dry-down my skin is the same as if I'd used any other cheap lotion with bad ingredients- dry. After a week I see absolutely no difference in my skin whatsoever. As I said the cheap ingredients are to blame. The end result is like using a cheap drugstore lotion mixed with perfume and extra petroleum jelly and mineral oil but why would you want to? Useless,Neutral
I am Native American with light medium skin. When I SuntanI turn medium to dark brown. I used the Jergens BB cream for medium skin tones and it really made my skin feels so soft.This cream has a pinky beige hue that makes it look like Foundation. The color does not dye your skin but it does give your skin a slightly Rosie glow.  It is good for several different skin types but it does have a strong musky scent that may interfere with your other body products.  The smell reminds me of Obsession perfume.My daughter loves itbecause she does not have to wear perfume when she uses this cream.I on the other hand do not like the strong sense. I put it on my hand and it felt nice and soft and smell okay but when I rubbed it from my elbows down on both arms with sent was so overwhelming I became nauseous. So if you are affected by strong scents this is not for you.My sister also loves the scent.*warning. Do not use on broken skin irritated skin are open skin areas. I accidentally got this on an examole irritated place and it burned a lot. Pinky beige colored hydrating body cream for medium deep skin scent like obsession. not for use on broken or irritated skin,Neutral
Jergens BB Body Cream comes in different tints for different skin colors. This particular one is intended for &#;medium deep&#; skin tones and has a definite tint. I have quite pale skin and after applying it cannot see any difference in the color or the way it reflects light. I gave it to a friend with dark skin and it made her skin a bit shinier and eliminated some slight ashiness but there was no difference in the actual color.The texture is very dense and creamy and feels good when applied to the skin. The moisturizing effect is quite good and fairly long-lasting.It has slightly floral and powdery perfume that is fairly long-lasting over a more pleasant base scent of natural shea and cocoa butters.My skin is fairly sensitive and some ingredient in this cream made it sting slightly until it was washed off. My friend had no such reaction and liked the scent much more than I did as well.So although I would not recommend this for people with sensitive skin or noses it is an effective moisturizer with a luxurious feel when applied and a scent that some will find appealing. Rich moisturizer,Neutral
I found this does even out and somewhat darken my skin tone with repeat application and is a light moisturizer (less than I need during the heating season; may be fine for summer). However I believe it is short-sighted of manufacturers to put perfume in everything when it is known that a large percentage of the population has perfume allergy some serious and when even those without said allergies will not want competing fragrances in multiple products. And I was glad that another reviewer stated the problem with parabens. I do give credit for the seller for listing the product's chemical ingredients. OK but contains unnecessary perfume,Neutral
I have waited a loooong time for this product.  I love this lightweight volume styling whip and would give it  stars if not for the price.  It does it's job beautifully lots of volume without any nasty residue.  It has a pleasant  light citrus scent  and  does not  interfere with your perfume. Lovelove love this lightweight non-sticky Styling Whip.....would give it  stars,Neutral
It does stick to the skin and is thick and creamy. I don't like that it feels tacky for so long on the skin. It doesn't have any real smell so that is good especially for skin that is sensitive to perfumes and scents. I tried this on myself and it didn't really help my dry skin much it seems to lay on top and doesn't get fully absorbed. But it is gentle and it seems to provide a protective layer. Only OK,Neutral
Being free of dimethicone is important to some people some of whom are too young to know that this ingredient might be a problem. (I mean the babies for whom this is intended.) Dimethicone is a silicone-based polymer that forms a protective barrier to moisture loss but for some people it creates a problem when impurities are thus trapped on the skin. I feel it's important to state that this formulation doesn't have dimethicone because it has become ubiquitous in skin lotions.It also doesn't have other problem ingredients such as fragrances dyes or steroids. Those substances can also be allergens; perfume in particular is a wide-spread allergen and can cause a host of reactions - if asthma quite dangerous but also discomfort ranging from coughing sneezing eye-watering mental confusion headache skin eruptions - and those too young to defend themselves need to be protected. Thus I recommend this product.In fact it is a medium-thick lotion that spreads easily and to me feels very protective.There is one odd problem: the heavy little tube is hard to grasp due to its shape - it keeps slipping out of my hand. This IS a problem. Dimethicone-free also fragrance-free,Neutral
Eucerin has a great product here. This is a serious cream not a frilly perfumed one. It has little smell to it and feels somewhat greasy on touch. But when it is applied to dry skin it soaks in quickly and effectively soothing even dry patchy skin. It relieves the itch of dry skin too. I highly recommend this product! Very Effective Therapeutic Body Cream!,great product
So far with only using this product twice today my skin feels so soft. My arms are amazing. The one thing that I am so impressed about is how it does not leave residue on your skin.****Day Two Update****So far I am very pleased with this Argan oil. Last night I did do the scalp relaxing with this product. To be honest it was very nice. I have continued to use it on my skin as well. I used it this morning and this afternoon. So far my skin is so nice and soft. I had to discontinue use on my face. The only reason I had to stop using it on my face is because my face is extremely sensitive and I have to be careful. The product still soaks into the skin rapidly and there is no residue left. I was able to put it on this morning with my perfume with no problems when it comes to mixing the products and smells. So far and its only days two I would recommend this product to you. It is a very nice treatment for your skin. I really have noticed great results on my legs and arms.****Day Three Update****So it is now day three. The results are still amazing. I have been using this product on my body and hair as well. My skin on my legs are not as dry as what they normally are. In the summer it seems that my legs tend to dry out rather quickly. With this product they are silky smooth. I have also been using on my arms and stomach. I have had the same results with these area&#;s as well. The product even though I have been using it for three days now still is soaking into the skin nicely. I did discontinue use on my face due to my over sensitivity to some products I wish it were not so. I can only imagine the results one would have on their face. My hair is silky smooth as well! So far excellent results and I am starting to really get addicted to this argan oil!****Day Four Update****Here we are already at day four. So far this product does everything that it states. My skin and hair are so very soft. Like I said before I had to discontinue use on my face and I could only imagine what my face would feel like. This product has really made my legs so very soft and they don&#;t seem to be as dry any more. I think  that I am going to end my review today because I feel like I am saying the same things over and over.In conclusion I would recommend this product it is amazing! A must try A must try Argan OIl,argan oil
I hate the scent of this oil. Loathe it. It reminds me of baby powder mixed with old lady perfume. Fortunately after I've dried and styled my hair I can't smell it anymore!Other than the smell I really like this hair oil. I use six pumps on damp hair and then style as usual. I know my hair feels stronger and less dry after using this for a month. I have found that I have to avoid the bang area though as it looks oily and weighed down if I get any of the oil on it.This isn't my favorite hair oil (that honor goes to the Macadamia brand) but it is very affordable--after using it each day for a month I still have more than / of the bottle left. It also does a good job. I definitely recommend it--if you can get past the smell! Great hair oil but ...,Neutral
I'm not a fan of two-in-one products whether hair care or something else so I've rarely used them. But as a fan of Suave products (I've been using various scented body washes and shampoos over the years especially in summer when I'm looking for something lighter and a bit fragranced.) who is looking to cut down on time spent in the shower I thought I'd give it a try.I have very dry color-treated wavy-curly hair. I'd been using separate shampoo (L'Oreal Vive Pro) and conditioner (Suave Color Care). Even with the post-shampoo conditioner I still need leave-in conditioner/styling products on my wet hair. Same case with this but I did save a step.If your hair doesn't require deep conditioning of the type you can get from using a separate conditioner this -in- product may work well for you. As it is I've ended up using this product more frequently than I imagined. I alternate with my regular product routine and on days when I want to shampoo only my hairline at top and back of neck this product has worked very well.Granted it doesn't offer deep moisturizing but after using I could still get a comb thru my hair (something I can't do if I don't use any conditioner in the shower after shampooing) and it felt pretty silky even when wet and was NOT prone to tangling.But I must confess that I bought it for the scent. Almond and Verbena especially in summer are two of my favorite scents. (I'm not big on fragrance in general and due to allergies no longer wear perfume or any fragrance.) I really liked the lightweight scent on this product which did not seem to stick to my dry hair--I don't want my hair to smell like anything! In the winter it feels like a bit of summer. In the summer it's the light fragrance wafting in the shower that makes me feel like I'm in a hair salon or spa getting some special treatment. And it's a great antidote to heat and humidity and a more pleasant shampooing experience in the summer when almost daily shampooing is a must. A bit of summer in the winter: Pleasingly scented value-priced shampoo/conditioner that's light on moisturizing,Neutral
I use a variety of oil-type products in my hair and am always looking for something a bit cheaper that works just as well. This might have been it if the smell wasn't so dang strong. And on top of theDove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner  Ounceit was just overpowering. Otherwise it seemed to work okay. Nothing spectacular but nothing horrible. If you can get past the smell (or if you like it) then it's probably a decent product. Very perfume-y scent that lingers worked okay,Neutral
Suave has been around &#;forever&#; of course and for good reason.I must say that I am &#;death&#; on any product that smells like perfume or &#;flowers&#;......I don't know if most other guys feel this way or not but I assume they probably might. Colognes etc. anything with a &#;fragrance&#; turns me off for two reasons one is that I am sensitive to these smells and the second is that I just do not want to smell like I am &#;prepared&#; or whatever you want to call it.I wear NO scents at all ever. I keep myself clean naturally but no longer feel a need to &#;deodorize&#; myself. Thus when I find a product with a light clean next to nothing scent I like it! This is one of those products.My hair responds well to it sparkling white and clean stays in place nicely without anything to hold it and best of all there is no &#;perfume residue&#; wafting from me after showering etc. Further my beard likes it too! Fluffy again sparkling white shiny staying in place with just a simple combing and again no breathing &#;perfume residue&#; all day either.It lathers really nicely rinses out completely to a really nice &#;squeak&#; and it also comes in the &#;landmark&#; Suave &#;easy for a man to hold&#; container.Give it a try yourself I bet you're happy with it too!~operabruin Excellent Product and with a nice fragrance!,Neutral
I love Suave products. All of them work well and are very affordable. With Suave I can get the quality of a higher priced hair/body product without the high price.This men's shampoo has a good smell- fresh but not too strong. It smell manly and not like perfume. And it works great on different hair types. Another Good Suave Product,Neutral
This shampoo smells great. It has a fresh clean odor without smelling like perfume. It lathers well and doesn't leave your hair feeling sticky or slick. It does a great job getting your hair clean. Can't go wrong with Suave,Neutral
Decided to try this shampoo. First off the smell wasn't overpoweringly &#;manly&#; like Axe and some of the other anti-dandruff shampoos out there. The smell is subtle which I love (I hate cloying men's cologne perfume deodorant or shampoo). He says the consistency isn't as thick as his everyday anti-dandruff shampoo so it was easier to rinse out. Results were comparable to what he normally used before trying this: no flaking at all no scalp over dryness no greasy residue. As with other anti-dandruff shampoos it works best if used everyday instead of every other day but I guess this depends on how bad your dandruff is. My husband has chronic seborrhea on the scalp and he needs daily maintenance shampoo like this one. He still uses Nizoral once a week as part of his anti-dandruff regimen and we keep his hair short because we noticed that the longer it is the more the flakes seem to appear and are harder to shampoo off. Overall he was very satisfied with this and says this will be his daily shampoo from now on. My husband loves it!,Neutral
My son sometimes gets dry skin and flakes...especially in winter. The hairdresser that cuts his hair mentioned it to him and he has been a little self-conscious about it since. She did sell him some expensive Paul Mitchell stuff (probably the reason for the comment!) and he likes it. I tried to buy him another drugstore brand but he didn't like the smell. This however doesn't smell icky at all!! It isn't medicine-y. (I sometimes wonder if the ingredients smell like medicine or those other brands MAKE it smell like medicine so you think it is more effective!!)Anyway this smells like a male-type of bath product. Sort of herbal musky citrus-y. But NOT overwhelming with perfume like some products. I used it myself a few times (I am not a man) and didn't mind the smell at all. It lathers well and does help control his dandruff dry skin. AND it isn't overpriced (also available on subscribe and save!!!! Nice!!) My son loves this!!!,dry skin
This is a pump spray bottle of good smelling moist hairspray for kids.  It is extremely light.  I tried in on my shoulder length fine hair and to get anything I could notice in the way of hold I had to pump it several times until my hair felt wet where the spray was.  The scent is very light and vaguely smells of coconuts.When I pumped enough to notice a difference in my hair my hair stayed damp for five minutes and dried to a smooth controlled texture that was a bit difficult to get a brush through.  It flattened my hair and took the volume out of it but at the same time made it look smooth piecey and weighted down which for my fly away frizzy dry hair is actually a good thing to have some weight although the way it flattened it down to my head was something I've not yet seen a product do.I think for kids with unmanageable mains and unruly fly-away hair that needs a little something to hold it down and make it look finished this would be perfect although you do have to use about  or  pumps to see any type of difference.  The scent fades away in about one minute so they won't be walking around smelling of perfume.This actually texturizes a bit giving that piecey look so that you can see the place where a comb was run through the hair which is a nice and sought after effect.  It doesn't add any grease at all but you can feel it in the hair and should make a daily hair washing necessary. I liked this product quite a bit and can see that for a child's hair it will be an excellent product.  Kids will like the light natural scent too.edit //I noticed the next day after using this liberally that my hair was in place and smooth and doing what I wanted it to do and the only thing I had used on it was this the previous day.  I put a little more on today putting the spray nozzle up against my hair to give it little shots of hold just where I need it in front around my face and it works so beautifully I am upping this to five stars and giving it my rare ten star rating as a product of excellence.This light spray is serious business but doesn't look like heavy spray and can be aimed exactly where you need it.  It's perfect and I would buy it for myself. Smells great,Neutral
This conditioner comes in a . ounce flip-top bottle and is thick and white. The scent is Macadamia Oil and White Orchid and it smells nice but it&#;s really strong smelling. It definitely a feminine scent and it reminds me of perfume. I usually like stronger scents but this is a little much for me personally. It&#;s mainly the floral scent that you notice.As far as how well it conditions your hair it&#;s about average to me. It certainly not the best that I have used but it&#;s not the worst either. I just feel like most of the moisture rinses out of your hair right away and I can hardly tell that I used conditioner at all. It&#;s advertised as providing  times the moisture and I simply don&#;t see the benefit based on my experience. I don't feel the  times moisture as it claims and scent is a little strong to me,Neutral
The standout quality about the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion line with Macadamia oil and White Orchid is definitely the scent. It is scented pretty heavily. I wanted to mention that in case scented hair products is not what you prefer. I absolutely love it. It reminds me of a Bath and Body Works fragrance. It's that lovely of a scent not hair product smelling at all.For the formula it is a moisturizing formula and the formula is for normal to dry hair. I have dry hair and it works wonderfully. It moisturizes without weighing my hair down.Definitely a recommend on this one. Lovely Perfume Scented Conditioner,Neutral
This 'natural Infusion' of macadamia nut oil and so forth was surprisingly light in application for a creamy conditioner. It rinsed well from the hair  leaving it soft to the touch and best of all it left my head smelling wonderfully fragrant like a fine perfume.I was merely looking for a chemical-free conditioner for dry winter hair and have found a conditioner I think may well work all year round. Pleasantly surprised!,Neutral
This moisturizing conditioner works well on my hair.  It leaves it feeling soft and smooth.The macadamia oil and white orchid scent smells wonderful without being over-powering and doesn't leave my hair smelling of perfume - just a nice clean scent.This is listed as being for normal to dry hair and is also safe for color treated hair. Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Conditioner,Neutral
I have used Suave conditioner for several years because I can't afford to buy salon brand conditioner.  Most recently I have used theSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner  oz.  I have sensitivity to the perfumes used in a lot of products.  I did not get a bad reaction from the scent of this conditioner so that is good but it is a little too flowery for me.Scent is a hugely personal thing so others may absolutely love the smell of this product and think I am crazy for not liking it.  I suggest giving it a smell test if it is available at your local store.Even more than the scent this conditioner isn't designated as being for color treated hair and didn't make my hair feel as soft as the Moroccan Infusion conditioner so I will continue to purchase that one instead. It smells too flowery for me,Neutral
I like the Suave Professionals line of conditioners. It straddles the line between the cheapest low-end conditioner (which qualifies mainly as &#;cream rinse&#; for detangling) and the higher end products that build the best head of hair you can have at a premium price. I have tried several in the Professionals line and not one of them let me down. They all enhance shine body combing out ability and reduce frizz. Ironically while higher end product leaves hairing looking a bit better I've found that it makes my hair so smooth that it doesn't tend to hold its natural wave. Suave gives me boosts while allowing me to style my hair and have the waves and curls hold together.This has a very pleasant somewhat tropical scent. The only down side is that it's a bit stronger than I'd like and I find my hair smells a bit too perfumey for my tastes. Otherwise this is really great. nice scent solid conditioning,Neutral
I have fine straight hair and this conditioner leaves it soft and silky without weighing it down at all. The scent is divine. It smells quite strong while you're using it in the shower which made me concerned that it would leave my hair smelling perfumed. I'm pleased to report that the scent rinses out almost completely leaving only a faint wonderful fragrance when my hair is dry. It's probably not even strong enough for anyone else to smell on my hair but I love it whenever I get a little whiff of it.I have no idea if the ingredients are as &#;natural&#; as the product name implies but I'm not all that concerned about it. I alternate among a variety of hair products some all natural and some not so I figure I've got a good balance.I haven't yet had a chance to try the shampoo that goes with this but I highly recommend the conditioner especially if you have fine hair and want it to stay light and bouncy. I Love It.,Neutral
This is one of the better moisturizing conditioners I have tried. I have older dryer hair that is no longer naturally shiny and bouncy like in my younger days and so I need all the extra moisturizing I can get from a conditioner. I have also tried the Moroccan version of the Suave Professionals Infusion conditioners and that one is also very good. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite line of hair products. The only slight reservation I have is the scent. It is a little strong and perfume-like ... however it fades quickly and doesn't linger after use. I prefer the scent of the Moroccan version a little better. But this is just as moisturizing so I won't take off a star just for the scent (which is highly personal anyways). Great moisture for dry hair,Neutral
I'm a fan of the mid-range line of Suave products with their improved conditioning ability at a reasonable price. The line that is in these gold containers is generally a good one (the Moroccan oil infused one is the best in my experience but others are also quite good). This one seemed to fall a bit shorter on the merits than some of the others that I've tried and I have no idea why that should be.The primary point that I had issues with was the amount of frizz it controled and the lack of shine enhanceent. It did a great job of boosting body and maintaining wave. Combing my hair out which can be a chore without conditioning because it is very long and think was not problem either. The texture of my hair was also nice and soft. The scent was a bit too perfumey for my tastes.Everyone's hair is different and perhaps this one just didn't play as nice with mine as some of the others have. I would choose this over other conditioners but I wouldn't choose it over other conditioners at the same price point in the same line made by Suave. solid but other Suaves suit me better,Neutral
This is an excellent conditioner for fine straight hair like mine. I get silky hair with no fly-aways and no added weight. And the fragrance is wonderful. It's a delicate floral scent with just a hint of spice. I'm generally hyper-sensitive to artificial fragrances but so far I have used three of the shampoos and conditioners in this Natural Infusion line and none of them have bothered me. This Awapuhi Ginger/Honeysuckle variety is especially gentle on the scent. No overpowering perfume here which I love. If you like your hair to smell pretty after it's dry you might want to try the Suave Macadamia Oil and White Orchid conditioner instead. It has a more potent fragrance that lingers a little more in my hair after it's dry. Leaves My Fine Hair Silky And Bouncy And I Love The Subtle Fragrance.,Neutral
I don't like the smell of this conditioner. It's perfumey and teeters on the edge of being overpowering. Luckily it fades as my hair dries otherwise I wouldn't have been able to use it more than once. I don't find it to be particularly good for my hair or bad. It just seems to be average. It made my hair easier to detangle than if I had used no conditioner at all but I didn't find it to be any more effective than other brand of conditioners in this price category.This conditioner works as well as any to make my hair easy to detangle when it's wet and manageable when it's dry but the overpowering scent makes it a no go for me. Too Perfumey for Me,Neutral
First let me state that I love the smell.  A light floral with a hint of ginger this shampoo provides a welcome change from fruity and perfume-y scents that my other products use.  And the scent lingers after my hair is dry as well.Second the shampoo lathers quickly and luxuriously and rinses easily.  I feel that my hair is clean after using the shampoo but I cannot tell whether it helps prevent breakage or makes my hair look fuller after using since I have to have my hair pulled back and contained for my job.If you have hair of any length you should probably use a conditioner with this shampoo.  My hair is very long (below my hips) and I cannot use a shampoo without a conditioner.  So I purchased the complimentary conditioner which has the same fragrance and allows me to comb through my hair with out difficulties.  The price is good for this product and I will likely purchase it again simply because I like the smell. Nice scent needs to be used with conditioner,Neutral
We've been a Suave family for a couple of decades and have yet to be disappointed in the products we've tried. I really like their Professionals line. This particular shampoo smells great without being overpowering. I have had issues with other brands where the perfume is so heavy it gives me a headache until I rewash my hair. Not so with Suave their use of fragrance has always been just enough without being too much.My hair is clean with a nice amount of body. I don't do a lot to my hair just comb it out & go so I don't put lots of different products on it. Suave works well for me & the price is perfect. Very happy with Swave products,Neutral
This is a nice smelling shampoo and cheap. It's typical of most suave products it's highly perfumed little drying on the hair but it's inexpensive. My kids love it as a bubble bath. love it honey!,Neutral
I've always had very long hair that needs to be washed every day but during the winter months it tends to dry out and with highlighting it it also has turned slightly brittle at the ends.  And in enters tons of breakage.  I've tried other shampoos that are supposedly great for breakage or adds shine and life to hair but I've always found them to leave me with a massive oily scalp.  The ends of my hair might look slightly better but the top of my head is really weighed down with the moisturizers in the shampoo leaving my hair looking quite dull and not clean.  Which lead me to always use a daily cleaning shampoo that took out dirt and oil but it also ruined my already bad ends and caused again more breakage.  So I decided to give the Suave Professionals Natural Anti-Breakage Shampoo a try to see how it worked.  It actually makes my hair feel smoother and my brush I'm happy to admit has a lot less hair caught in its bristles.  I found that I could actually wear it straight without having to flat iron it (I already have very straight hair) to hide the frizzy ends.  It does slightly weigh my hair down though and I've found when I curl my hair it also doesn't want to keep the curl all day as some of my other shampoos.  I've also found that I can't use it every day due to this issue because after two days of use my scalp is left feeling slightly like it still has shampoo in it after a washing.  So I've started using it every other day and this works very well with my hair type.  I've noticed a lot less breakage in the time I've been using the shampoo and my hair does look better!  The smell of this product is great and perfumed also!  I totally recommend it if you're looking for a shampoo to help breakage and restore some of its natural health. Definitely Helps Breakage and Restores Health!,Neutral
I use Suave shampoo all the time because my budget doesn't allow for buying salon brand shampoos.  Most recently I have usedSuave Professionals Shampoo Black Raspberry with White Tea . Ounce (Pack of )andSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo  oz.  I have sensitivity to the perfumes used in a lot of products.  I did not get a bad reaction from the scent of this shampoo but it is a little too flowery for me.Scent is a hugely personal thing so others may absolutely love the smell of this product and think I am crazy for not liking it.  I suggest giving it a smell test if it is available at your local store.It also didn't make my hair feel as soft as the Moroccan Infusion shampoo so I will continue to purchase that one instead of this one. A little flowery for me,Neutral
For me it's always the conditioner rather than the shampoo that determines how good (or bad) my hair feels and looks. Pretty much any shampoo that gets my hair clean and doesn't stink is fine as long as I have a good conditioner. This shampoo works great for me when used with the conditioner that goes with it. It gets my hair clean with just a small amount.  With this shampoo my hair doesn't require the &#;rinse and repeat&#; step but if you have oily hair your results may vary. The fragrance is lovely and not too strong and it doesn't linger. Definitely not overly perfumed.I've tried three different shampoos and conditioners in this Suave Professionals Natural Infusion line and have had excellent results with all of them. Wonderful Fragrance That Doesn't Linger.,Neutral
Let's preface this review by saying that the majority of the hair and body care products I use is Suave. I have often tried other more expensive products but return to Suave as the quality performance and price can't be beat.That being said I am quite sure this shampoo would be wonderful...but I couldn't stand the smell. I know smell is subjective but I think the turn off was because the product was damaged in shipping: STAR for product shipment! This is the nd beauty product I've received that has been shipped by Amazon in just a padded envelope...and damaged. Gross. There is nothing worse than trying to remove a bottle of thick liquid that has leaked over everything. You could smell the shampoo as soon as my husband walked in the door with the package. And it was so strong it turned my stomach. Perhaps in its small recommended dose of application it is fine (as the same ginger and honeysuckle leave-in product didn't bother me quite as much). But that overwhelming scent (which reminded me of a fussy old lady with too much flowery perfume) smeared all over and inside the ripped up torn up bag turned me off...and I had a hard time even using it. STARS: So...based on my prior experience and love of Suave products I would likely have rated the shampoo a  if the overwhelming scent bomb caused by insufficient packaging hadn't changed my mind.Amazon shipping is usually great &#; but again the two damaged shipments I've received have both been beauty products which should obviously be protected against loss of liquid everywhere. As a result my overall review comes out somewhere in the middle... :-( Thumbs down on scent and shipping; Thumbs up on Suave!,Neutral
The smell is wonderful if it was perfume I would give it  stars. As a hair product I was luke warm about the results. My hair didn't change drastically using it. I have fine hair and found that after a few hours of using the oil it would get heavier and then greasy. By the evening I needed to clean it again. This just doesn't work for fine hair. Not for fine hair,Neutral
This is a light spray that adds oil to your hair. I like that it is apparently non-toxic and does not smell like perfume. Unfortunately it did not help my hair which is quite fine. I was hoping it would help the dry fly-aways but instead it separated the strands looking rather messy.The fragrance although quite light lingered until I washed my hair. It reminds me of coconut which gets tiresome after a while. I probably won't continue to use it. Not Bad but Not Right for Me,Neutral
Although this product may not gloss your hair to the high sheen thatPantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist . Fluid Ouncecan this Suave product does a fine job softening brittle hair.  It has a nice light fragrance that disappears soon after using so as to not interfere with you perfume or cologne.It does give you shine just not a high glossy shine.  The Suave does not leave your hair limp or oily looking.Both of these products may be used on damp just before styling as well as on dry hair to give  a little added boost in the shine department. Adequate,Neutral
I have curly hair which gets dry and then turns into a hideous ball of frizz. If I want to put in the effort of styling goop and  minutes with the hair dryer I get nice curls if I don't have time for that I have to wear a ponytail and a hat to leave the house. This Suave Oil mist gives me a third option I've been wishing for being able to lightly mist my wet or dry hair then comb with my fingers and end up with some decent looking hair. It's really not greasy at all. It does stink like cheap perfume for the first half hour but then the smell disappears almost completely. Totally worth it. dry curly hair,Neutral
I've never used a product quite like this before. I can lightly spray it on my hair and it will help keep it moisturized and soft. I love the scent! It reminds me more of sandalwood than macadamia nuts and orchids. The scent seems to hold so it might clash with perfume. The only thing I don't like about it is that I can't style my hair with hairspray because it won't stick. It's fine for days when I'm casual and don't have to use hairspray. A tiny bit goes a long way so it's important not to use too much or it will make my hair feel weird. It works well on my granddaughter's hair too. Her hair is very frizzy and this helps keep it under control. Love the scent and it does moisturize well,long way
I've been using this light leave-in cream for a few weeks now and I'm really liking what it does to my hair. Because my hair is pretty long and curly it tends to tangle if I don't condition it quite regularly. Since I don't wash it every day I like to use a leave-in conditioner that will help with combing.Other leave-in conditioners have made my hair feel weighted down. I like this leave-in because once it's in I can style my hair and by the time it's dry (whether I blow dry or let it dry naturally) my hair doesn't feel heavy and it doesn't look flat. I'm also able to use this several days in a row without feeling like I'm getting a greasy buildup.I've used this on both wet and dry hair and find that it's easy to distribute through my hair either way. The scent is light and pleasant. I actually got a random compliment on the scent of my hair when I hugged a friend. The scent is just slightly floral but it's very clean and not so strong as to overpower or clash with any other perfumes or lotions you might wear. Light weight and light scent but definite strength,Neutral
I received this product from Amazon on the vine and am glad I decided to try it.  The directions say to use  to  pumps and work roots to ends on damp hair and  to  pumps on dry hair.  My hair is fine and just past my shoulders and  pump is plenty for me.  I also sometimes use it on my  yr olds fine waist length hair and again only use one pump. It does have a perfume like smell that I notice when I first use it but not so much throughout the day. It does help with getting a comb through damp tangled hair and leaves it feeling soft and conditioned.  I've also noticed less breakage.  I would purchase this product again. Smells great love it!,Neutral
I dithered between  and  stars because this is pretty strongly scented straight out of the bottle. The reason that it wound up getting  stars is because it's pretty remarkable.I have waist length very straight very fine hair. The kind of hair that shows build up quickly and can look greasy and limp too easily. I love the idea of leave in conditioners but most of them are too heavy for my hair. This one isn't - pumps applied to the ends first with the rest being distributed through my hair makes it easy to come nice and soft without being too heavy or like a styling product. On my daughter's prone to frizz curls- her curls were tamed while still remaining full and not being weighed down.The scent straight from the bottle is strong and reminds me a bit of the perfumed pages of high fashion magazines it does dissipate pretty quickly. There is no greasy look with this leave in just lightly scented very soft hair. Truly light conditioning in a leave in,Neutral
The thing I really like about this product with the reeeeealy long name (Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Light Leave-in Cream is a bit of a mouthful) is that it softens my brittle hair wet OR dry.If I need to go out and have serious bed-head this gets my locks back to luscious. Or at least acceptable.The scent is ok but think about if it will clash with your perfume before using it before going out. Wet or Dry,Neutral
Let me preface this review by saying it was unfortunately influenced by the package damage I received with the companion shampoo:Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Shampoo . OunceYou can read my full review of the shampoo here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RXQTZPXZDE/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permAs soon as I realized this leave-in cream had the same smell I cringed. Knowing how much I do like Suave products however I wanted to give it a try...as much as I possibly could stand.THE GOOD: The leave-in cream was light and didn't weigh down my hair. It did not feel greasy or sticky. My hair did look smoother with less noticeable breakage/flyaways after straightening with a flat iron.THE BAD: the scent (which reminded me of a fussy old lady with too much flowery perfume). Again I know scent is highly subjective - but I had a hard time using the cream for an extended period of time as I just didn't care for the smell. Both good and bad the scent does stay (lightly) with your hair throughout the day. If you like the smell this is good. If you don't...well every time you turn your head blech.I liked the GOOD of this leave-in cream enough that I wish it had a different aroma as I would use it daily! But for me I just can't stomach the smell enough to do so. If you can it's another great product by Suave! Eh good product; didn't like scent.,great product
Many years ago I asked a hair stylist what the difference between expensive and budget shampoo is. Her one-word answer: &#;Smell.&#;So how does the Suave Seaweed Lotus Blosson smell? Very good. In fact as I was shampooing my wife walked into the bathroom and commented on the pleasant smell which is not cloying or overpowering like cheap perfume.Also the milky white shampoo is thick with good viscosity not watery like cheap shampoos.When I shop for Suave products (I'm nearly bald and don't feel inclined to pay a lot for a shampoo) I'll be looking for this particular scent. Recommended. Great Smell and Thick Viscosity for a Budget Shampoo,Neutral
I loved the fact that this conditioner doesn't have parabens or dyes.  Also the smell is rather subtle (I'm not a big fan of strongly perfumed conditioners) and the liquid is thin enough not to clog my shower dispenser which is what happened when I used tubes of Dove Nourishing Oil Care Daily Treatment Conditioner (it was too thick).As other reviewers have said the packaging is a little strange in that the opening of the bottle is on the bottom rather than the top.  However this is ideal for not having to squeeze the bottle for conditioner - it's easier to pour out from the bottom though you have to be careful to wipe away the excess and keep the cap firmly closed since it will keep dripping downwards.Unfortunately this conditioner is not as effective as others that I've used that give your hair some weight and body. In fact the product description itself implies this: &#;For longer lasting volume use with Natural Infusion All Day Body Leave-In Foam&#;. I don't like products that suggest you use other products to supplement it esp. volume when most conditioners offer this.So while I really wanted to like this product I have to say it's best for people who have thick hair and want to have less frizz and smoothness. If you have smooth straight hair like mine that tends to be limp without extra help I suggest looking elsewhere. Hair Feels Smooth and Soft But Not a Lot of Volume,Neutral
I've been using this Split End Rescue Shampoo in conjunction with the Suave Professionals Split End Rescue Conditioner and I have to say that I really like them both. I've generally found that Suave products are right on the mark for me or they can be a little on the lower end of quality. This shampoo hits the mark. It has a good consistency and a nice clean smell. I've been using a lot of heat on my hair lately and you couldn't tell from looking at it.The scent is nice and clean without perfume-y overtones. My seven-year-old is also using it because her hair is very long and curly and tangles often cause breakage. This shampoo and the complementary conditioner really work to keep it in good condition. Good Cleansing Clean Scent,Neutral
This is an adequate conditioner - nothing special. It has ingredients that are attracted to damaged hair - +vely charged chemicals. So it claims to reduce split ends by up to %. It made my hair bouncy and consequently already existing split ends tended to rise and show.Whereas I like strong perfumes I don't like food-like smells. This conditioner smells like coconut with a hint of lemon. It's not objectionably strong so I can tolerate it but I prefer a floral scent.On using the conditioner after putting it on the top part of my head I had to dilute it to get it through to my roots and scalp. I don't mind diluting the creamy liquid as it means that the bottle can be smaller. Despite it being quite thick it did not make my hair feel heavy after rinsing and it looked fine.This was better than using a shampoo/conditioner mix. It uses very common ingredients - chemicals that make the hair slippery and shiny preserve the product and smooth the skin.  Its from Unilever so has some of the same ingredients as other Suave conditioners.I like the bottle which is upside down so the thick liquid comes out easily. Also the bottle has a slight waist which means it doesn't slip out of your hands given the conditioner is quite slippery.Here's a list of ingredients - with an explanation as well as I can do it from various websites including the US government's Household Products Database the Skin Deep (R) Cosmetics Database and Wikipedia (I am not a chemist):- Water- Cetearyl Alcohol cetostearyl alcohol or cetylstearyl alcohol - emulsifier foaming agent -  emulsion stabilizer opacifying agent and foam boosting surfactant as well as an aqueous and nonaqueous viscosity-increasing agent - very common- Dimethicone -also called Polydimethylsiloxane - makes hair slippery - a silicone oil- Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine- Behentrimonium Chloride also known as docosyltrimethylammonium chloride or BTAC- CH(CH)N(Cl)(CH) used as an antistatic agent and a disinfectant  a quaternary ammonium salt used as a preservative - very common in conditioners- Dipropylene  Glycol - polymerization initiator solvent.- Lactic Acid is an alpha hydroxy acid; naturally produced in the process of bacterial fermentation for example milk fermentation. Lactic acid is frequently used as an exfoliant and in anti-wrinkle products -  the most significant effects caused by exposure to lactate esters are respiratory dermal and ocular irritation.- Polyquaternum-- Amodimethicone - amine-functionalized silicone - yields an inorganic cationic (+vely charged in water) polymer - attracted to -ve (e.g. highly damaged) hair - makes hair shiny and slippery- Potassium Chloride- Disodium EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent used to sequester and decrease the reactivity of metal ions that may be present in a product. Softens the skin.- DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative with the trade name Glydant.  Can cause dermatitis in formaldehyde sensitive people. Corrosive can cause irreversible eye damage.- Cetrimonium Chloride - a quaternary ammonium compound used as a preservative - antiseptic and conditioning agent. Can irritate eyes nose and throat.- PVM.MA Copolymer- Methylchloroisothiazolinone - MCI - is a preservative with antibacterial and antifungal effects within the group of isothiazolinones. It is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria yeast and fungi.- Methylisothiazolinone is a widely-used preservative; has been associated with allergic reactions. (Lab studies on the brain cells of mammals also suggest that methylisothiazolinone may be neurotoxic. - however Toxnet did not show anything significant)- Fragrance - smells like coconutAt the concentrations in this product I wouldn't expect any irritating effects at least I did not experience any and rubbing the conditioner on to my hands made them feel smooth after wiping off the excess. Coconut lemony smell - thick and creamy - good bottle,Neutral
Conditioners affect hair differently based on hair type so I will state that my hair is &#;normal&#; very long thick wavy and tends to be soft rather than coarse. My main issues are that my hair can be dull-looking (because I'm ) have frizzies and can either blow up to epid bad-hair-band proportions or flatten out so that I lose body and waves depending on the product.The main reason I wanted to try this conditioner was frizz control. I realized that the price I might pay is that it'd flatten out my waves and I'd see less body. Fortunately that was not the case. It held the natural shape of my hair (which is actually very good and doesn't require curling irons or other assistance) kept good body and seemed to damp down frizzies. I don't have tons of split ends but I do have some flyaway hair which this seemed to tame.The only points on which this did not excel were shine enhancement (this neither enhanced nor diminished my remaining shine) and combability. I used a fairly modest amoutn on my hair working it into wet hair from the mid-point to the tips and then squeezing the conditioner onto my scalp. Mainly I'm looking for easier combing near the ends and this didn't quite do as well as I'd hoped on that front. I did have easier comb-out but I could not smoothly detangle the tips. All in all especially for the price this is a solid performer as a conditioner. I'd like to give it . stars because I think it's not quite as good as Suave's Moroccan Oil infusion (which is my currently low-end favorite) but I think it does rate  stars for overall value. It also have a good scent which doesn't linger (whereas the Moroccan Oil is overly perfumey and does stay with your hair all day). good body texture enhancer,Neutral
from my wife's perspective:I have tried multiple brands of dry shampoo and have yet to be greatly impressed with any of them this one included. This dry shampoo has a Keratin Infusion in it but I did not notice a difference with the keratin versus a regular dry shampoo. The bottle says that the keratin will help keep your color longer. The whole point of dry shampoo is to absorb excess oil on days you haven't washed your hair. That way you have less shampoos less blow drys etc. So your color should hopefully last longer and your hair will be less damaged.I'm not sure how much more the keratin helped my hair but I don't mind having it in there. It's like getting a small extra treat with the dry shampoo I'm already applying. I didn't have any white streaks in my hair from using this. But I did vigorously shake the can before and in between sprays as instructed. What I don't like about this product is the strong scent. It isn't an unpleasant scent. It's not as though you will be smelling like baby powder all day but the smell is strong. Strong enough that it could at first compete with your perfume.If you are looking for a dry shampoo I would recommend trying this if you don't mind the scent or wear too much perfume. They're giving you keratin in with the dry shampoo so it's something a little extra for your dollar. works just as well as most dry shampoos,Neutral
This is a white powder.  I can't see it in my hair-my hair is near white now - sometimes I do put blonde color on it but it's so light that I wouldn't notice if I had white patches or not from this product. I did however just spray some on my red pants and yep it left a white patch that would not rub away so it very well might show up in dark hair like that.  My hair is very long and the ends get dry so often I don't much like to wash it everyday - it takes forever to dry.  This is VERY convenient to have around in the winter or when sick or whenever I don't feel like having a wet head for several hours.  (I don't always like a blow dry.)This product is great for between shampoos- when my roots get a bit oily the powder absorbs it and adds some volume and also fragrance.  This product smells fresh and fairly strong -  It has a powdery floral green smell.I think that this would be great for teenagers to carry with them to school for after gym class- my hair was oily as a teen and mid-day this would have really helped out.I have as a nurse used both baby powder and older medical kinds of dry shampoo - they all do work the same- the idea is that the powder will absorb the oil and scent the hair if you can't wash it. Headboards are great but can really be time consuming to use so the dry shampoos are good for the bed bound between washes too.  I'm glad that they are now becoming more widely available and Suave is a good trustworthy brand that people can afford- this is much cheaper than I used to pay years ago for dry shampoos for my poorer home care patients!The smell does last though - it really is about as strong as a perfume so see if you can sample it before you buy it.  I find it pleasing but if you don't like fragrances or THIS particular fragrance it could be a problem for you.  I think it is rather feminine so I'm not sure if I'd buy it for a boy or man.Also it is an aerosol.  I wouldn't use it on patients with respiratory issues or with trachs.There's also inhalant warnings on the bottle as it seems some folks might think they could get high on it because of this it might not be allowed on some psychiatric units or if it is it would probably need lock-up. Fragrant works for me,Neutral
This dray shampoo is good in a pinch but it leaves a strong aroma when you spray it.My preferred dry shampoo is drybar which is very expensive at $ a pop so i thought about getting this cheaper alternative. This dry shampoo while it does remove some of the hair oils has a lot of aroma/smell/scent. If you are like me and get migraines with too much perfume this dry shampoo can get annoying during application.If you don't mind it the quality is about on par with gotbe dry shampoo (though I think the gotbe shampoo is slightly better). My hair is dyed and I felt this dry shampoo did not further fade my color. Good in a pitch on par with gotbe dry shampoo,Neutral
This gave my hair some nice volume for an updo. It also smells pretty perfume-y which may or may not be your bag. I was able to use it on unwashed hair twice and it improved the look of my hair and controlled grease each time. Definitely worth having in your hair arsenal and I definitely would purchase again. Decent dry shampoo,Neutral
When you have fine fragile hair like mine you tend to over-condition. That means your hair can look dirty even when it isn't and when it IS well then it looks pretty disgusting.This isn't the first dry shampoo I've used. But it is one of the best. Used properly (in short bursts  inches away from the roots) no powdery look and no heavy perfume just a light fresh scent.What I like most if how it gives me a volume boost and knowing my color is safe. Great product great for my fine hair,great product
Well it works to reduce oiliness but at the cost of leaving your hair feeling weird sort of dull and stiff like you put baby powder in it.  I have very straight and fine hair so this may vary by hair type.It has a very strong perfume to it annoyingly strong.I had to take another shower after trying to live with the smell and feel for a couple of hours.  I had hoped that this will help with freshening up my bangs at the end of the day but it was a no go. I think I would rather have dirty hair then hair that smells like an air freshener and feels like I have baby powder in it.,Neutral
This goes on like a very fine powder. You spray it on the roots of your hair wherever it's oily and you should spray in short bursts not continually. Then you massage it in and brush. It has a kind of pleasant scent like perfume. It's a matter of individual taste whether you like it or not. I thought the scent was okay. As dry shampoo it helps a little but didn't seem to make a huge difference in my hair when worn loose. Maybe better if you're tying your hair back. There was no way my hair looked as good as when I wash it. It did look a little better than it had before I sprayed it. My advice is this is not a substitute for washing your hair but if you need it in an emergency it will help a little. Better than nothing and inexpensive enough to keep around for emergencies. I should add that I have long straight fine hair. The powder weighed it down a tiny bit.I should also say that this dry shampoo spray is a HUGE improvement over the dry shampoos of old! If you haven't used dry shampoo in forever you might be pleasantly surprised. It helps but not great.,Neutral
This product does a good job of removing oil and some dirt in between shampoos. And I tried this and it was very effective for this but I just about gagged when I smelled the very heavy perfume in this product. Since I am sensitive to heavy perfumes I was concerned about this yet it did not do any harm to my scalp. And after I opened up seveal windows and after about  minutes the strong scent began to fade.PROS:+ Effective on my fine and fly away hair. And this cleaned it well and my hair shined+ Great to use in a pinch or when I want a fresh shampooed look when I am in a hurry.MAJOR CONS:- HORRIBLE SCENT.- Personally I cannot recommend this because of the heavy scent. Good for an emergency dry shampoo but the odor is so heavy!,Neutral
I use dry shampoo primarily to give myself some extra volume on second day hair and this left my hair kind of flat. It worked for the oiliness in my scalp but that's not what I really need it for.Most dry shampoos have that powdery dry shampoo smell. Which doesnt bother me for the most part. The scent in this Suave Moroccan one tries to cover up the powdery smell and instead just made something kinda nasty. And unnecessary. I don't need perfume in my hair.My holy grail is the big sexy dry shampoo. That stuff works like a charm. But the feel of your hair is so....untouchable. But if volume is what you desire then skip this. If you can handle the smell and only need it for a slight root touchup then this might be perfect for you. I felt like it did soak up my minimal oiliness that I get on second day hair and left my hair still touchable. So that gets a big thumbs up from me! This is ok,Neutral
I think whether you will like this depends on your hair type honestly.This is a dry shampoo or refresher spray that works by absorbing oils while you spray sections of your hair.  I am sensitive to strong odors and this has a very strong perfume-like odor that I found to be very irritating.  It left my hair feeling very dry like straw and my scalp itchy.  Now I have course hair that is prone to frizzing so I have to wear a lot of product in my hair to tame the frizzies.  This is probably why this dry shampoo was not a hit for me.  For someone who is prone to oily hair this could be fantastic if you have no sensitivity to strong odors.  I think it really just depends on your hair.I would not recommend it for anyone with course hair prone to frizz. Not For Me,Neutral
I'm not incredibly sensitive to strong smells but I am sensitive enough that powerful perfume or chemical smells set me off on sneezing fits. It's not uncommon after a shower for the mix of shampoo conditioner deodorant and moisturizing lotion in the bathroom to set me off on a sneezing jag - and I try not to have strong-smelling products. This was just insanely hard for me to tolerate. One spray and I had to stop.Since I love the Moroccan Infusion shampoo and conditioner that are made by Suave I had high hopes for this but due to the strong chemical smell I couldn't even give it a fair shake on my head. I'm guessing that it may work better for people who aren't so sensitive or who have bigger bathrooms in which to disperse the odor! the smell killed it for me,Neutral
This is my first experience with a dry shampoo.  When I sprayed it on my roots and combed it through the hair I saw a grayish film forming that made my hair look lifeless and dull.  As I combed it through the gray disappeared and I breathed a sigh of relief.A few hours later though when the sun was shining down on my head I noticed that the hair was still really dull.  It didn't look too good with my otherwise shining locks.But what really got to me was the smell.  I'm not a fan of amber and this musky fragrance is STRONG.  I really wouldn't recommend to someone with a sensitivity to perfumes! It was OK but I think it wasn't quite right for my hair.,Neutral
I have reviewed many face washes but out of them all this one has my favorite scent! It is refreshing clean and very relaxing while having bright and subtle floral and musky notes. It is gender neutral in smell though as a woman I prefer men's soaps and face washes. My skin is sensitive and this soap leaves it just a touch dry for my taste but it's still worth it for the smell. Great product! I wish it came in a perfume or body spray! BEST SMELLING FACE WASH!!!,great product
For the purposes of this review I had the opportunity to compare Axe Spiked Up Look Extreme Hold Gel and Axe Messy Look Matte Hold Gel.I'm not going to gush over a hair gel but that's just me. I have relatively thin hair (in texture not amount) that I do cut short and then spike accordingly. I like to maintain the appearance of a controlled mess make it look like I haven't thought much about my appearance. So can you see my dilemma? I was offered one Axe product that promised Spiking and one that promoted a Messy look. Which to choose? I have a spiky mess! I know that Axe has been expanding their hair care market and it's a field that is absolutely flooded with choices. It takes a lot to win me over and make me a repeat buyer. I generally choose my hair gel based on price and convenience. In other words I'm not loyal to a particular brand or product.And while I was pleased enough with these Axe gels (one more so than the other) neither was revolutionary in practice.Spiked Up Look Extreme Hold Gel ( stars): Pretty close to what I traditionally use. As they say a dab will do you. I apply a very small amount between my finger tips and spread it into my hair before it dries. Then I use my fingertips to achieved that spiked look that I'm known for and as it dries it stays in position. There is a distinct Axe fragrance (which I could live without) but it's not overly perfumey or obtrusive.Messy Look Matte Hold Gel ( Stars): This is more like what they put on my hair after I've had a cut. It's probably better if the salon uses similar products but I like it a lot less. It does achieve a terrific messy look and hold but it leaves my hair feeling a little waxy. And when I touch my hair it makes me feel like my hands are dirty. It's undoubtedly a personal preference I just connect more with the other.Do these two Axe gels work? Sure. I've been satisfied. But neither is distinctive enough to cause me to seek it out as a loyal buyer. I'd probably purchase Spiked Up again if the price was right and it was at my local store but I wouldn't spend too much time looking for it. KGHarris /. Do I Feel Spiky Or Messy?

I have very short hair of - depending upon where it's located on my head. The beauty of the various lengths is that it gives me great flexibility in how to style my hair from au natural to very spikey or wavy.Although I'm a chick I really like the AXE product line because it first of all WORKS and second of all doesn't have that often cloying smell that girly products have. This is important if you love to wear a favourite perfume (Chanel # anyone?) and you don't want a silly hair product to compete with your fragrance.Styling is a snap: place a small portion on your hands and work it into damp hair. I flip my head downward and use a diffuser on my blow-dryer to dry it; it seems to lock in the spikes for longer wear than when I air dry it.Scent is marginal. The gel is NOT sticky. And it holds up quite well.All in all a GREAT product for not only what it does but for a wonderful price point too! Lives ^UP^ to it's Namesake of Spikes galore!,great product
OK Kathryn I will never ever be able to match that review you made on this shower gel. I really thought all those commercials were for real and that &#;things would happen&#; when you used this product. I keep thinking about the couple that always ends up in the separate bathtubs in the woods. Back to the shower gel. The gel has a strong smell and my wife has already said &#;you use the gel I will use something else&#;. OK with me as it will last longer. The smell while strong is not all that bad and it does add something to the shower area almost like one has been to a French hotel and stayed in one of those rooms that is overfilled with all those gaudy perfume smells. The gel does a fantastic job in lathering and washing. I have been using soap and I may go to this gel from now on.I personally think this is intended for the male user however who knows one or more females may want to give it a try too. Especially if you are cut out to be a lumberjack.By the way this is a very large bottle and should last several showers unless you really get carried away. &#;Ultra lather with addictive fragrances which give you a  super charged clean&#;. Now that is what the bottle says. I have to agree. Now the rest of the story on the bottle &#;Axe Peace a unique fragrance so addictive it sets you up to make love not war&#;. Gentlemen & ladies this is powerful stuff so be careful. But by all means give it a try. I did and now it looks like I may be an AXE Peace Sower Gel user for a lifetime. Now A User For Life,Neutral
Now whether you want to smell like a damp forest after getting out of a shower is up to you.  It is really a pleasing smell very earthy and not at all like a lot of shower gels that smell like cheap perfume.  I'll most likely get some more.  Worth a try. Smells like a damp forest.,Neutral
We always joke about Axe products. Being  somethings we do not need to feel like a magnet for every person of the opposite sex that we pass on the street. Since Axe commercials seem to focus on the stud market alone how fun for us to give it a whirl!First off it was shipped with a piece of regular tape (like Scotch) over the opening to avoid spillage. That didn't quite work and some was in the box and on the bottle itself. Luckily it wasn't that much but still worth a mention.I love the smell! It is a mix of green tea and sandalwood. I appreciate earthy scents rather than perfumey or overly masculine cologne smells. This was right up my alley. My husband enjoys it too. A little on a scrubby puff thing goes a long way. I do notice that the smell doesn't linger which might be a good or bad thing depending on how you want your shower gel to perform.All in all I recommend it for both men and women girls and boys. It is light not fancy and also hasn't caused anyone to tackle me in the middle of the supermarket. Everyone in the house is a fan.,long way
Axe is boldly venturing into new man-turf with it new line of peace-symbol-themed products.  HARMONY SHOWER GEL presents an alternative scent that seems to deviate from the traditional perfume-adoring target market of desperate high school boys and even more desperate college males.  Is this latest offering an attempt to lure unhygienic hippies to the world of cleanliness?  An accidental mix-up in the Axe scent lab that was too big to toss down the drain?  A pheromone-infused transcendental formula that hypnotizes young ladies into ignoring stupid things like personality and appearance?  Or maybe it's just a simple more-natural smelling shower gel.HARMONY'S aroma definitely generates a different vibe.  While I personally wouldn't define the scent as being masculine (a term that presents a myriad of interpretations) ... I didn't find it particularly overpowering either (not necessarily a bad thing).  I sensed an aroma that was earthy and sweet; the ginger was prominent yet somewhat subdued by the pepper.  Bottom-line this scent was certainly more natural-smelling and delicate than those of other Axe products.  While HARMONY doesn't provide any gimmicky tingle to symbolize being fresh and clean you certainly will come out feeling cleaner than bathing in the cow pond on Yasgur's farm.I will always give new Axe products a test-drive; I like the constant variety they offer (there's a little something for every guy).  HARMONY shouldn't trigger an itch to go shopping for toe-ring sandals or vintage VW buses but it just may be effective enough to wash away the smell of enjoying  days of peace and music in an open field with  of your best friends.

I've been an &#;Axe-man&#; for a few years now and have rode along through a couple of Axe&#;s product &#;cycles&#;. First was the &#;color&#; series with fragrance names like Excite Kilo Phoenix and Dark Temptations. Then came the &#;space&#; series with Deep Space Jet Apollo and Black Chill. In between were the transition fragrances Shock Snake Peel and Cool Metal. Now comes this latest series of what? New Age? Enlightenment? Sophistication? I don&#;t know but I consider it a winner. This fragrance known as &#;Harmony&#; is a slightly minty chemical-overtone dryer sheet on fire fragrance that I happen to notice is receiving a chillier reception than most in other reviews but I really like this sort of soapy not sweet smell. The gel itself performs like most Axe products: lathers up quickly and easily rinses cleanly and leaves enough of a smell that you know you&#;re clean but no so much that you smell like a department store perfume counter. When I received this fragrance I had just started growing attached to the sister fragrance &#;Peace&#;. Maybe I like these because they are lighter and manlier just what a -something guy like me needs. Anyway I think this product is great and I really like the smell which is why I give a full five stars. Another solid Axe,Neutral
We have several people in our home that are allergic to scents so I was a little worried ordering this Axe but I wanted to give it a try because my husband's other &#;manly&#; shampoo wasn't cutting it. My husband tried it and loved it. None of us are allergic to the scent and my husband's hair stays smelling great even after a hard day at work. It hasn't made his hair dry or coarse and no dandruff - like some of these kinds of shampoos can cause. Great shampoo and since we're not perfume wearers great scent that doesn't have to get sprayed in the air. Will buy again. Great Scent - Even for Allergy Boy!,Neutral
I wanted an alternative to American Crew's Fiber since not all stores carry it.[Good]This is pretty good at styling your hair.When it dries your hair will look natural. It won't be slick and you won't look sleazy or old with it.It has a much better feel than American Crew's Fiber when you're applying it.It has a decent container.[Bad]People will be able to smell the cheap cologne scent on your head for miles. It is really strong and overpowering especially indoors. The scent is so strong that you can't even get rid of it after a shower. It just lingers for hours. Even if you use less of it it's still really noticeable. The kicker is that I have a really bad sense of smell and this is just way to overpowering even for myself. I just can't use it for this reason.[Verdict]This should have been a five star product. I know that super strong scents are part of the Axe brand. I just thought that they were trying to reinvent themselves recently. I guess I was wrong. It's funny that the cheapest products use so much perfume and cologne that you'd think they cost more to manufacture than more expensive brands.Until they greatly reduce the scent I'm sticking with American Crew's Fiber. If I wanted a cologne smell I'd buy it and apply it separately. Great for styling but it smells too strong,Neutral
I have been using this product for about  days or so and I like they way my hair feels. I read another review saying that it didn't work well after  days of use.  I know for me I could never judge a product after  days of use. I have to give things at least a week and more like  weeks to be able to tell whether it works or not.  After  days of use I can say that I like it.  Here are the pros and cons:Pros:I love that it's organicThe argan oil really does leave your hair feeling substantially softerEven though its relatively thick it doesn't leave a thick residue on your hair like some conditionersI like the scent.  It's not perfumed but it has a pleasant scentCons:The bottle is very small.  I have finished it after  days of use (but I do have long hair)They have decided to use some chemicals in it which is very unfortunate.  Most of the ingredients are naturally derived but the last two ingredients are: stearalkonium chloride and phenxyethanol.  The argan oil and aloe and coconut oil in this product are enough to take care of making your hair silky smooth.  I wish manufacturers would get away from this concept that everything has to have chemicals in it.Overall I liked the product and I would recommend it.I received a sample for review. My hair feels nice,argan oil
Like many people I've struggled with oily skin my entire life.  The oil traps dirt clogs your pores and ultimately gives you acne.  Fun stuff.  As a teenager I suffered the worst of it.  Now as an adult it's manageable but still an annoyance.  That being said I'm always on the lookout for different morning facial washes to use in the shower.  I've tried many Nivea products for men and have enjoyed the majority of them.  Therefore I was more than happy to give Nivea for Men Sensitive Face Wash for Men  Ounce a try.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Applies gently to your face.+ Sensitive formula doesn't irritate skin.+ No drying alcohol.+ Chamomile and Vitamin E ingredients.Cons- Tube design collects and retains water around the cap if kept in the shower.- Although the product is advertised as a perfume free formula there's a lingering perfume smell that stays with you long after you've rinsed the product from your face.- After - hours my face was oily again.  No different than any other facial cleanser I've used.Nivea for Men Sensitive Face Wash for Men  Ounce just didn't cut it for me.  I didn't really see any noticeable change in my complexion after using it daily (sometimes twice) for a month but I can say that about most facial cleansers.  Would I use it again?  Probably not.  The fragrance free formula was definitely not as advertised.  To be honest my face smelled like Grandma's perfume for the majority of the day after use.  Not a scent I was particularly fond of and enjoy smelling.  However since I like Nivea products I'm glad I gave it a try. A gentle but overly aromatic facial cleanser,Neutral
I love this wonderful fragrance and I use the shampoo conditioner and some of the styling products in this line.  I was delighted to see that this body lotion has been added to this line.  It is a lightweight moisturizer - not heavy or greasy and gives me just the right amount of moisturizing for everyday use.  It smells slightly different than the shampoo but still has the same underlying scent that is in the rest of the product line.  It is fairly strong and I don't use any additional perfume with it.  I don't think the scent is heavy or overwhelming though. Love this fragrance,Neutral
Suave Professionals Body Lotion Moroccan Infusion has lots of potential for individuals who have occasionally dry skin.  I find it a bit too perfumed and have to pair it with another moisturizer to last.  When I use it alone on my dry skin I use more applications than I would typically use. Great for normal skin,dry skin
This is an excellent moisturizer. This lotion immediately removes ash and sinks into your skin. After a bath/shower you smooth this on and your skin feels wonderful. The only drawback is the amount of perfume. There is wayyy too much scent in this huge bottle. My suggestion is that Suave cuts the perfume in half and this will be a Star Five product. Lastly great moisturizer but a little toooo much perfume. Excellent Moisturizer but Way Too Much Perfume,Neutral
With kids and pets and a house to maintain plus all the germ exposure at school I wash my hands a lot so they are frequently dry.  As a result I go through a lot of lotion. This lotion has a nice consistency and is fairly fast-absorbing and I really like how soft it makes my hands feel but the smell is a little much. It smells a bit like Nag Champa incense which is a nice aroma but pretty intense. With the smell this strong just on my hands I can't imagine using it as an all-over body lotion; it conflicts with my perfume and is stronger than I usually wear a fragrance. Perhaps they also have this in an unscented version I can look for. Nice moisture fragrance is a little much,Neutral
I suffer from dry skin and eczema so all winter I have to be religious about daily moisturizer.Prior to this I used Aveeno's basic unscented daily moisturizer which worked great unless I skipped a day.This Suave lotion is rich and creamy sinks in easily and leaves my skin very soft for two days. That's right two days. I can moisturize every other day in the middle of winter and my skin is fine.I just which it was either unscented or had a milder scent. Instead there is a very strong perfume-like &#;Moroccan spice&#; fragrance that makes it difficult for me to use at times.With a better scent this would be a five star product. Works Well But the Scent Is Not So Great,dry skin
I tried this lotion and it goes on smoothly without feeling greasy but as one who does not use perfumes I didn't care for its scent. Although the scent is not that strong and it's not a bad scent either it's strong enough where I could still smell well after it was absorbed into my skin with the scent lasting for several hours. That's the reason why I'm giving it three stars. But if you prefer a long lasting scented lotion then you probably would like this product. SCENT A LITTLE TOO STRONG FOR ME,Neutral
This spray is very silky and immediately works on dry rough areas of skin. It really helped smooth out the sun dried skin on my legs and rough heels.  I have only good things to say but I would like to caution you that if you aren't very careful with the spray and some gets on the floor it is very slippery.  I have found that I like spraying it into my hands and then massaging it on.  Also it does have a scent and while I find it pleasant it does last a little while and will be noticeable and could interfere with your perfume and cologne.  I've found it better to use at bedtime.  This is a great product and I'll continue to use it. Highly recommended. Great product.,great product
The Moroccan Infusion Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil Spray has done wonders in re-hydrating my skin! I found that very little tends to go quite a long way too! I've been using this  ounce bottle for about two weeks and it still appears to hardly have been used. The transparent bottle this product comes in is nice because I can see how soon I'd be needing to pick up another. The spray head on this bottle has more of a direct shot than a spray liked I imagined it would have. Because of this I tend to squirt the oil into my hand and then rub into the desired area. I find rubbing the oil in helps it to absorb into my skin much quicker. The smell is delightful and I always get compliments by my husband after it's applied. He and I tend to be quite sensitive to many smells and fragrances causing adverse allergic reactions than often start with sneezing fits but have had zero issues with this product.What I really like is the fact this hydrates my skin and the silkiness that follows after it being applied. There is definitely a glow too! It absorbs pretty quickly so there's no need to worry of it staining anything I am wearing. I usually apply directly after a shower. I really like this oily and compared to other it doesn't leave me looking or feeling greasy after application which usually last all day long. The fragrance isn't overpowering though I would recommend not wearing anything else when using this product. I feel that this fragrance would clash leaving an undesirable scent if mixed with a lotion or perfume. Other than that I would totally recommend it! It's decently priced considering how a little goes pretty far! A Little Goes a Long Way!,long way
I like some Suave products quite a bit -they are very affordable and often comparable to higher priced brands.  I'm not crazy about this one. I've used dry oil sprays before and I expect them to spray a fine mist of oil that is absorbed quickly and is dry to the touch. This product does not fit my idea of a dry oil spray. It sprays a stream rather than a mist and you get a concentrated amount of oil in one spot which you then need to even out with your hands. A dry oil spray should not require this step. It does not absorb quickly - I wouldn't use it before getting dressed.The oil itself has a mild fragrance that is not too perfume - y.  Note that mineral oil is the main oil in this spray rather than the argan oil that is touted on the front label. So not a dry oil spray and not mainly argan oil either. NOT REALLY A DRY OIL SPRAY. NOT REALLY MOROCCAN.,argan oil
Once again as with the other products in the Suave Professionals line the first thing I noticed is the intoxicating exotic smell. I love it! It's not overpowering though. I only wish it lasted longer. It does linger but doesn't last that long. However the moisturizing effects do last.I agree with another reviewer that it comes out in streams or squirts rather than an even spray so you do have to even it out by spreading it around. It's not a major issue for me. I have gotten it on my clothes and it does leave a spot but in my experience it always comes out in the wash but it you get it on the clothes you're wearing that day you might not be able to get it out by cleaning it by hand. However this is easy to avoid.I know some reviewers said it was oily but that is in fact what it is -- a dry body oil spray. It does absorb quickly. And it does a great job moisturizing my dry skin especially in the winter. It lasts all day and you only need a little bit. You don't need to lather it on like you do sunscreen spray. So one bottle does last a while. I like how it make my skin look and feel radiant and silky. I know this is probably mind over matter but I feel a little more confident when I use this spray. Maybe it's the exotic scent that does it but whatever the reason I enjoy the feeling!While it's not made for this purpose I often use it as a type of perfume and spray it on my wrists and neck for a light pleasant exotic fragrance.It's funny that I was reading another reviewer's comment about the oil going on warm rather than cool like most creams. It's funny because I was thinking the same thing. It's minor but it's a nice benefit in the winter when most people need extra moisturizer.I would definitely recommend this product. It is an oil so if you are not a fan of oils you might not be happy with it. But if you like oils and/or are open to another type of product to relieve dry skin then I think you'll enjoy it because it works; it's lasts; it's easy to use; and it smells wonderful but the smell is not overpowering at all.My only suggestion to the manufacturer is to take a look at the nozzle and how it dispenses the oil. I thought it was just my bottle but I notice others find it doesn't come out in a spray either. It's not major but just something that I hope they address.I highly recommend you give this product a try! Love the Idea of a Body Oil Spray for Dry Skin,little bit
All in all it's not that bad but maybe just a little pricey considering the ingredients.The main ingredient in this body oil is mineral oil hench the fact that it goes on a little heavy and isn't as easily absorbed by your skin. It sprays on in a stream instead of a mist so you do have to rub it in a little after using.  My skin gets pretty dry and itchy in the winter so I've been using this spray after showers and it has helped with the itchy skin but I'm still having to use a moisturizer as well as the oil. I noticed that a lot of people really liked the fragrance but I really didn't care for it myself to me it smells a little cloying like old lady perfume. A little heavy.,Neutral
Well how to describe this topical body oil&#;let&#;s just say that it isn&#;t like pure/natural oil &#; such as olive oil sesame oil coconut oil etc. &#; but it helps the skin by leaving a similar feel. Though the bottle says &#;unscented&#; &#; my guess meaning there is on perfume-y added scent such as you might find at Victoria&#;s Secret or Bath & Body Works &#; but there is a mild &#;scent&#; of the oil [mixture] itself. The scent is NOT strong or overpowering however for someone who is more sensitive to ANY kind of smell [such as my mum] then I&#;d exercise caution when using this by either putting it on some time before you are around someone as such [if you are aware of someone being this sensitive] or simply not put much on.Thus far I&#;ve tended to simply apply to my arms (forearm elbow upper arm some of the shoulder and the calf &#; knee area(s). The oil is a bit thicker than some kind of pure oil and for me it leaves my skin feeling refreshed & hydrated but not overly oily or that feeling  of &#;oily&#; like some pure/natural oils can leave (if over-applied).The slight scent does not bother me and though the &#;spray&#; is more like a jet of oil (there really is not a &#;spray&#; feature to it which I&#;m disappointed but oh well) so I HIGHLY recommend exercising great caution when trying to apply and either slowly & gently press on the &#;spray head&#; (is that what it&#;s called?) OR I&#;d suggest squirting a wee bit in your hand [fingers or palm] and then rub it on the area you wish to hydrate.Now the directions/description &#; the ones that I remember reading &#; state that it is &#;best&#; for after you get out of the shower (I understand the principle behind that) but for me the first/one time I tried it I just felt&#;.greasy. So I just use it for when I need it/want it&#;or whenever the occasion arises that I feel the need to use it.All in all it isn&#;t that bad of a product out there on the market. Would I personally continue to use this after my current bottle runs out???? Maybe. I wouldn&#;t rave about it but I honestly don&#;t have anything negative to say nothing to an extreme or overly bothersome or distasteful. The only &#;negative aspect/feature is the disappointing lack of a &#;spray&#; but I can live without that&#;it really isn&#;t too inconvenient. Would I recommend this? Yes. I wouldn&#;t promote/advertise but if someone was set on purchasing a body oil [spray&#;..or no spray] or some kind of product similar to this one I&#;d support the purchase and use of this one. a strong   &#;  &#;  &#;  &#;  / not a 'love' but still rather enjoyable,Neutral
This product reminds me of my Neutrogena Sesame Oil which I have loved and used for years  The dry body oil spray is good for when I am on my way out the door and just want to give a nice sheen to my arms and legs.  It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  The scent is not unpleasant but I wish it were unscented so it wouldn't clash with my perfume. Good for a quick moisturizer,Neutral
I have to admit my hair can be quite frizzy at times and while pulling it back into a ponytail might seem the obvious solution that particular hairstyle can sometimes just emphasize the frizz in the shorter hairs that pop up all over what should be a sleek pulled back look. This smoothing creme didn't completely tame those frizzies but it did make them seem less like crazy wires and more like part of a natural hair style. More importantly when I wasn't wearing a ponytail this serum helped add a glossy shine to my hair. I've had other products that can do this (maybe not quite as effectively) but what really impressed me about this product was how little I have to use despite my hair being rather long and thick.I like the scent of this product too. It's clean and not perfume-y at all. And it dissipates after an extended time so that it doesn't overpower any other scents that I might be wearing. Gives me a glossy shine but doesn't quite tame the frizzies,Neutral
My college-age daughter has dark brown hair which she has professionally dyed platinum blonde.  She wears it in a cute short spiked-type style which she achieves by blowing dry and straightening.  And as an active young woman she sweats and washes her hair often sometimes even twice a day.  So her hair goes through a lot.She has been using this deep conditioning mask for a month now.  She says it's the best product she has ever used to keep her hair soft and shiny and to help protect against split ends and dry scalp.  She says that the mask is easy to use and she likes that it has no scent.  She says that she likes wearing her perfumes and doesn't like her hair products to interfere with their scent.  She uses the product just about every time she shampoos unless she is really pressed for time.  She says that her hair has never looked better.  She asked me to send her the Tresemme Renewal Shampoo and more of this conditioning mask before she runs out so I know that she really likes it.  It may be a tad pricy for a college student's budget but for what it does I think the price is worth it.Recommended. My daughter loves this stuff,Neutral
I love the slightly pepperminty scent of tea tree oil and I love the tingling that it brings to my scalp as it conditions my hair. This Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Deep Conditioning Mask leaves a very pleasant scent in my hair that doesn't smell at all perfume-y making it an ideal product for both men and women. The product instructions suggest that you use it in place of or in addition to your regular conditioner and they also suggested that you comb through your hair with your fingers or a comb to work it through to every strand. While these directions would easily work with any conditioner I think combing through with my fingers really did help to detangle not just in the shower but afterwards as well. My hair currently has a lovely shine to it which I can at least partially attribute to this product. Tingly Feeling Refreshing Scent Great Hair,Neutral
This is a wonderfully thick conditioning hair and scalp mask.This glided on our hair easily and rinsed cleanly.  It didn't leave any oily or slick feeling on our hair.  But it did leave our hair very soft smooth and it made it so much easier to style.This has a nice light smell too.  It's not too strongly scented or full of a perfume smell.We use this every  or  days and it has seemed to make a great difference to our hair.  Our hair looks and feels much healthier. Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Deep Conditioning Mask,Neutral
I love this shampoo - it's really nice-smelling and makes my hair feel great. It doesn't feel dry or brittle afterwards which can happen with cheaper stuff. The shampoo is creamier than most and I had wondered initially if it was a shampoo + conditioner. It is not but it seems like it.The smell is GREAT - it's a really nice smell. Not perfume-y but nice. Not strong... a gentle clean smell.My hair feels really clean and soft after using this shampoo. It claims that it &#;nourishes the scalp&#; but I can't see any specific benefit there. I actually have itchy bumps on my scalp (diagnosed by my dermatologist as &#;oh yeah lots of people have those&#; - huh?) and this product despite containing tea tree oil did nothing to alleviate those. I still have the itchy bumps on my scalp. My scalp didn't necessarily feel more moisturized.Overall a great shampoo and one I'd consider using again and making a part of my regular hair washing routine! Love it! Silky smooth hair that smells great,Neutral
Can someone explain to me why this product is listed at $. when my local Shoprite sells it for $. (same size!).Anyway I have very long thick hair that is prone to broken/dead ends. I've recently been using Herbalife shampoo that my sister got me for Christmas as part of a gift basket and I've been happy with the results. But Herbalife products themselves aren't inexpensive either (and when you start buying the stuff they pressure you to become a distributor *sigh*). So suffice it to say I'm actively looking for a product that will provide similar results that I can buy off the shelf.I'm happy to say I'm pleased with the product. It has a nice rich lather and a pleasant but not overwhelming smell. It smells clean and fresh not &#;flowery&#; or like perfume. Despite being promoted as a shampoo for women your man can safely use this shampoo and not worry about smelling like a girl. I've never had issues with dry scalp so I can't comment on whether or not this does anything for that particular condition. Buy it at the grocery store instead!,Neutral
If you regularly use one brand of shampoo your hair can eventually become flat due to build-up. I wanted to try this product to see if there would actually be any &#;renewal&#; and was extremely pleased with the results. It has a pleasant &#;clean&#; scent (no heavy perfume) and produces an EXTREMELY thick lather. The results? Your hair and scalp will feel MUCH cleaner. Hair picks up volume and is much lighter. This stuff WORKS it is a great product and I recommend it highly. Excellent Product,great product
I was really hoping that this was going to be a good product.  I've used other Tresemme products and really liked them so I was disappointed with this one.  My five year old daughter has very curly unruly hair that gets tangled horribly.  So I thought trying a good leave in conditioner would help with the tangles and calm the frizzies down.  The first thing that I didn't like was that the perfume scent of this spray is VERY strong.  If you don't like strong scented hair products this one is not for you.  I like the scent itself okay it's just over powering.  The second thing is that it did not help with the tangles it didn't even make her hair softer it ended up making it sticky and crunchy.  So it didn't help with the tangles at all.  I did not like the way it left her hair feeling because it left it sorta stiff and crunchy like I stated already.  So it's not a bad product and for a different hair type it might work better but I didn't like this product. Perfume Scent is too strong,Neutral
Hello my name is Leah Marie and I am a bit of a hair products junkie.  It started when I hit puberty.  First I would pilfer my mother's products.  Soon I was a complete addict - spending all of my babysitting money on gels and mousses.* Shampoos* Clarifiers* Conditioners* Glosses* Glazes* Temporary color* Leave-in conditioners* Smoothers thickening spray beach hair spray......I've tried it all.I have my favorites (like Hemp's now-discontinued orange shine spray and Aveda's Damage Remedy) but I am too liberal to remain beholden to one line.I ordered this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.  I have tried other fabulous hair products courtesy the Vine Program like Toni and Guy's Leave In Conditioner.  Unfortunately this product is NOT fabulous.  The conditioner did not leave my hair soft or smooth.  The worst part of it:  IT SMELLS NASTY.  No lovely perfume or clean soapy smell.  No botanicals or fruits.  It smells like Mr. Clean.  That would be great if I was mopping my bathroom floor but who wants to toss their hair and smell chemicals?***Also the shampoo that goes with this conditioner was horrendous.  It left my hair feeling stripped and dry (even when it was soaking wet)...and that was only after one application!  By day seven I looked like the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.Sorry Tresemme I am a human not a scarecrow. Stinky Head,Neutral
This is a good cream for sealing the moisture in my hair to prevent the frizzing after I finish styling it. It can be used while blow-drying the hair stylizing with  a flat iron or hot air brush and even while I'm wearing a ponytail or a braid because it does keep the hair in place. It has a strong scent that lingers and that heat makes intense. It&#;s a nice one but I don&#;t recommend using perfume along with it. It took a couple of uses before I get used to the smell of it. Good to keep the humidity away from one&#;s hairstyle,Neutral
Oh at the end of a long day it really is tempting to use a cleansing cloth (or make-up remover cloth). The quick swipe of all make-up...followed in a few days by nasty breakouts.Not so with the Cetaphil cleansing cloths! The smell is fresh and neutral not perfumey; each cloth is large enough to remove the day's make-up; the texture is very gentle. Best of all these cloths get skin wonderfully clean (including my waterproof/long-wear mascara and eyeliner). They don't irritate my sensitive skin and they don't cause breakouts. Perfect for travel too.These are going to become a part of my regular routine! Favorite cleanser >>>> favorite cleansing cloth,sensitive skin
I was chosen to do a review of this product and I don't know what I was thinking when I applied for it. Having Lupus SLE (an autoimmune disease) and being a former Cosmetologist even more wonderment in my mind on what I was thinking when I ordered this and accepted the chance to review this product.What are my concerns with a product like this? Though in theory this should work think about Aerating a lawn... what aerating a lawn does is let more water and fertilizers and the such get into the lawn better. In the same way as Aerating this should allow more of the good stuff in your skin care products to penetrate the skin. And since it is punching little holes into your skin it should also in the way of slight damage (if not used to vigorously) cause your body to produce more collagen and elastin supporting your tissues and in the end making your skins structure stronger.Now for the concerns (and why I didn't use the product) this although UV/Gama Sterilized and in a Sterilizer type bag (inside the box) sterilized things usually (by law in a tattoo shop like my husband owned) should be dated as even unopened & unused should be sterilized once again within  months (or at least the laws stated that via the Health Department in the state we had the tattoo shop).  Secondly after use it should be sterilized again for your protection even if we had the simpler form of sterilization in our homes (a autoclave) we wouldn't be able to use that with this since it's made of plastic.Next concern if you don't have super clean hands or skin you may have a problem. Think of common household pathogens that are found everywhere in the household touch the faucet and your pass the pathogens to anything else you touch... set the Derma Roller down there your go again. And don't forget pathogens that pass on illnesses can be air born as well.Further concern is the slight puncture wounds to the skin and overly using this product (rolling it too much or using it too often) can actually cause damage to perfectly healthy Elastin & Collagen instead of helping your skin to develop more. And because of the puncture type wounds although tiny you will be causing some swelling and irritation... even if you don't notice it at first. As a result of these wounds to your skin you could suddenly become sensitive to your skin care regime molecules from your hair spray or perfumes and even sensitive to your own makeup. Sunscreen could suddenly stop working the way it is supposed too and because it's penetrating deeper into your skin you may also run sensitivities to these as well.Now I have Lupus SLE and I couldn't use the product because of that to even test this out once... if you have any broken skin sores rashes or even ingrown hairs (and more) don't use this on your skin until you are healed. And if you are thinking about getting this to use at home please talk to your doctor about it (describing the product an appliance for what is commonly called &#;needling the skin&#; and the fact that it can't be boiled and has no instructions for cleaning the needles between use etc) and ask your doctor what they would recommend. Better yet talk to a dermatologist he will tell you if my worries are any real concern or not.For now take my recommendations or leave them... just please leave this sort of needling the skin to the hands of the professionals where you can sit back relax and test out what this does for you in a clean and sanitary environment. :) Former Cosmetologist Sees Some Possibilities and Yet Has Major Concerns!,sensitive skin
I love smelling good but I really don't like the lingering scents of heavy perfumes. There are times when I get in an elevator and can still smell the perfume of the people who are no longer in the car! Just too much! So when I was asked to try Pink Champagne Handmade Hair and Body Spritz I was excited because it sounded so light and fresh!School of Wash was started when a loving mom sent her daughter to camp and the daughter sold the bath products that her mom made to all of her summer camp friends. The feedback from those sales was so positive that School of Wash was created! Now the Mother/Daughter owned company makes handmade products that contain no dyes and are safe for sensitive skin right here in the USA.School of Wash promises that they will use the highest quality ingredients that are paraben-free talc-free SLS-free sulfate-free sodium choloride-free and freshly made when ordered! They deliver fresh hand-made products right to your door. What's not to love about that?!There is nothing better than an intoxicating aroma and the Pink Champagne Hair &amp; Body Spritz is just that - intoxicating!  It's light and fresh and you can use it as a body spray spray it in your hair and even on your clothes!  It moisturizes too so your skin will get an added benefit as well.The scent is clean and bubbly. I love it! It's refreshing and doesn't have that heavy hanging odor that a lot of perfumes do. No worries about your scent lingering long after you're gone!I received this product to help facilitate my opinion however my opinion remains my own. So clean and fresh!,sensitive skin
My girlfriend used this here's what she says about it. This an affordable utterly competent self-tanning lotion that achieves a realistic sun-kissed tone on fair to medium skin tones.  The lotion itself is thin and easy to spread - not tacky and it has a light very pleasant smell; it&#;s not cloying perfume-y smell nor does it smell like the mineral pigments so often used in tanners and makeup.Unlike other similar lotions I have tried Visible Glow is not so tinted that it leaves one&#;s hands clothing or towels with orange streaks. As long as the usual &#;use sparingly&#; spots on the body (knees ankles elbows) are spared the skin darkens naturally and does not get overly orange-colored. It's not a miracle product since washes off with a shower or two and a close shave (most self-tanners do) but in general it does exactly what it&#;s supposed to do and does it well. After trying Visible Glow I am sure I&#;ll I will use this brand going forward. Pleasant to Deal With Works Extremely Well,Neutral
I've used sunless tanners on my legs regularly all summer for about  years since I reviewed a bunch of them for a story when I was working at The Detroit News. So I've known a pretty full range of products. This Suave Professionals tanner I tried out in the past couple weeks for a trip out of town to cover an event. It worked great. The lotion (which is of a slightly thinner consistency than others I've used) went on easily. I used it over the course of a few days and it did produce a nice even tan with some results on the first day. The tan was natural-looking. You do have to be careful to go light around the ankles and the knees which is true of all sunless tanners.Couple things about this product that puts it above the others I've used: These types of products can have a pretty strong smell after they've settled in (hours after application). It can be a chemical-like smell or more of a perfume smell that radiates off the skin. This Suave product had very little scent -- I could barely even detect it. Plus the tan faded evenly. That's pretty huge. Some of the tanners I've used fade in a rather chunky fashion -- with (for lack of a better word) globs in certain places on my skin. And after a while you can even scratch the stuff off because it starts to flake. This product did not do that. So yea five stars! So I've known a pretty full range of products,Neutral
Argan oil is extracted form the kernel that comes from the Argan tree that is found in Morocco. It has so many benefits in it's natural form for the body to even using it in foods. I have used Argan oil for many years now for my hair because I use a Keratin process to straighten it. I have thick long Latina hair and I avoid using products that weigh my hair down making it look greasy stiff or dull.My hair goes through a lot - from chemical straightening to coloring and high temperature appliances such as blow dryers and flat irons. Argan oil protects my hair before using heating appliances and then locks in the look after. Rich in Omega  and  which helps to prevent hair loss and repairs damaged hair follicles. Absorbs quickly into your hair without weighing it down.Apply to wet hair just before blow drying to eliminate friction and prevent hair breakage or apply to curly hair to give it a polished look that will last all day long. Protects adds moisture and shine...naturally.I was pretty impressed on the size of this bottle it is quite large for the asking price. It comes with an eye dropper which is a nice touch since most other brands you have to pour it out and you tend to pour out too much.Another great comment I must mention is that the odor disappears after a few minutes of application. I don't understand how but I love it! This is % Argan oil with no perfumes. If you know your Argan oil you know they are not pleasant smelling unless the have perfumes added. However after rubbing this into my hair the odor &#;magically&#; disappears and I am felt with no harsh smelling scent.No matter if your hair is thick dry frizzy thick curly or just out of control - Argan oil will help. Do some online searches for the many uses of Argan oil. Besides using it &#;as is&#; from the bottle you can use it as a hot oil treatment skin moisturizer dry scalp and eczema treatment treat dry hands and cuticles treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid use it to grill vegetables add some lemon and use as salad dressing. The list can go on and on....Sample provided for review. Naturally repair and condition your hair,argan oil
The Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF  is an excellent moisturizer. I found my skin feels smooth and clean. No grainy substance as posted in one review. It proposes to provide the benefit of  anti- aging properties:Line Minimization: Reduces the Appearance of Fine WrinklesNourishing Moisturization: For a Radiant Healthy GlowTone Enhancement: Balances Color & Reduces Appearance of Age SpotsGentle Exfoliation: Smoothes & Evens Skin TextureDark Circle Reduction: Reduces the Appearance of Dark CirclesFree Radical Defense: Helps Prevent Damage to Skin&#;s SurfaceDryness Defense: Moisturizes to Reduce DrynessIt will take a few months before I can say yay or nay to those  properties. However I can say that it does provide nourishing moisturization. The protection against sun damage is questionable. Once you have applied make-up over this moisturizer does the sun protection still apply? According to dermatologists you need to apply sun screen lotion or cream under the moisturizer for a good effect. And the directions say to apply every two hours if going into the sun.This moisturizer has a pump effect which is appreciated. The moisturizer has a very slight scent that I like. Heavy or even light perfume scented moisturizers are a real turn off for me. I like the scent the fact that the moisturizer does leave my skin feeling smooth. I did inadvertently get a small amount into my eye and even though I rinsed it thoroughly with water several times it did leave an irritating feeling for  minutes or so. The next day my eyes were fine. So please be careful around eyes.The list if active and inactive ingredients is quite long take that as you will.Active Ingredients: Avobenzone % Homosalate (%) octisalate (.%) Octocrylene (.%)Inactive Ingredients: Water Glycerin Niacinamide (vitamin B) Polyethylene Dimethicone Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer Pentylene Glycol Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Stearyl Alcohol Isohexadecane Cetyl Alcohol Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B) Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E) Benzyl Alcohol Behenyl Alcohol Dimethiconol Sucrose Polycottonseedate Ethylparaben Methylparaben Cetearyl Glucoside Cetearyl Alcohol PEG  Stearate Disodium EDTA Stearic Acid BHT Polysorbate  PEG  PEG  Laurate PEG  Dilaurate Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate Citric Acid Titanium DioxideRecommended. prisrob -- Light Scented,Neutral
This is really a sunscreen with the drawbacks of one: it's thick and a tiny bit grainy and it will cake on your face if you apply it too heavily. It's not really ideal for under makeup but for a day outdoors it's probably useful. That said we really do need sunscreen and this one at least has nutrients for the skin. The scent is a little perfumey but it fades. I don't know about the anti-aging effects yet but I will update.Update: Now it's not grainy at all. Maybe there was a dried-out bit in the pump? It's still kind of thick but as sunscreen it's great. I still wouldn't use it under makeup. It's more for outdoor use. Thick and sunscreen-like,Neutral
I'd used the fragrance-free version of Olay Total Effects with SPF  for years eventually switching to another brand since Olay didn't make the Total Effects with SPF  so when I saw this I thought to myself it's about time that you came out with the SPF  version Olay! Now that I've tried it I'm going back to the Devita SPF  sunscreen. The Olay Total Effects is too thick and I feel like I'm making more wrinkles as hard as it is to spread. After it soaks in I can still feel it on my face. The active ingredients in this are chemical sunscreens except for titanium dioxide which is near the bottom of the ingredient list. It's so close to the bottom it's not listed as an active. But as far as keeping my face from burning I was out in the sun several hours yesterday even while driving which seems to make burning worse for me and my face wasn't red at all. Fragrance? I'm very sensitive to fragrance in skincare and this isn't perfume-y and didn't bother me.I like this better and it's a physical sunscreen:Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF + -- . fl oz It's about time Olay,Neutral
I do not understand this product. First impressions can mean a lot. In this case I liked the fun and vibrant packaging but when I opened the jar the color and texture of this product made me think someone had mislabeled it and it was actually hair gel. I was reluctant to put it on my face but I have to review these products so apply it I did.It goes on wet takes a few minutes to dry and leaves the skin somewhat matte looking. I can not discern any difference between my skin before and after application of this product. Is it moisturizing? It didn't seem as if it was. I have dry skin and it was dry before application and dry afterwards.Additionally I find the smell too strong. It's a perfectly nice clean flowery scent but I wear perfume and I don't want to wear something this fragrant right on my face or have my skin care product overpower or clash with my perfume. But that's a minor consideration when I can't detect any moisturizing properties in this at all.I am surprised. I use quite a few Olay products and like them a lot. I did think this might work as a light primer under foundation from what I read in other reviews but it did not. I see other people gave this product five stars. I don't know what is happening on their skin but it sure isn't on mine! Strange stuff indeed,dry skin
I have many lotions...I buy them and they are fine...but they don't impress me enough for me to really be especially loyal to one kind. I don't usually spend an excessive amount on lotions/moisturizers as I haven't tried many where they have performed so well that a high price has been justified.This has a very nice texture. Almost gelatinous. It reminds me a lot of pudding or yogurt. But shiny. If fruit juice was made thick enough to be pudding it would look like this! What is nice about it is that it feels really nice and cool putting it on. And the thickness of it helps it stay where you put it. Sometimes I put a thick smear on and just let it take its time and soak into my skin while I am doing something else. It does seem to keep my under-eye area nice for longer than a thinner lotion.It doesn't have much of a fragrance...which is good for me. I don't like overly perfumed lotions for my face. And sometimes they can smell medicine-y or just plain yucky. This one isn't that. This may be one I actually buy again! I really like the cool feel of this!,Neutral

Last fall when I knew the cold weather and electric heat were coming I got the moisturizer I have been meaning to try for years--Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream . Ounce.  That is the stuffGood Housekeeping (-year auto-renewal)once tested and said was better than a $ cream they also tested. Well either Olay changed the ingredients in it since that testing or maybe it was just my skin type but Regenerist ended up being a total waste of money.  It did nothing for my skin except make it look duller. When I got thisOlay Fresh Effects Dew Over Hydrating Gel Moisturizer . Fluid Ounce I immediately stopped using the Regenerist and used this only at night.  It worked much better and left my skin brighter; although my skin doesn't absorb it as well as other gel types I've tried.  The perfume scent is also not one I like but it causes no headaches and dissipates quickly. I stopped using this Fresh Effects tonight however because now I am tryingOlay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream . Ouncefor two months.  If that doesn't work well or when I run out of it I'll probably go back to this gel moisturizer. It's good enough. Worked Better Than Regenerist . . . .,Neutral
First let me start by saying I LOVE anything that Poppy Austin makes. So when Poppy Austin contacted Everything Beauty and Beyond to try out their Vitamin C serum I literally almost cried. And I am not saying that because they sent me a free bottle of Vitamin C.  Before I was even contacted by them I was already using their Argan Oil for my face and hair and loved it!! I love them because . They sell the real deal. Their products (vitamin C and Argan Oil) are all natural with nothing added or taken away.  . The dollar amount for the size of product you get is amazing!  Their Argan oil for example is priced at $. US versus their competitor which is $ US for a much smaller bottle! Ok back to the Vitamin C review here!One thing that I love about this product is that it contains Hyaluronic Acid.  Now I know a bunch of you out there use face serums and creams and have absolutely no clue what you are putting on your face. tsk tsk! You should ALWAYS read the back of the packaging label and google what the main ingredients are before applying it on your face.  Things like witch hazel alochol parabens fragrances and perfume should never be applied to face or found in your facial products.  This are all signs of potential irritants for your skin.So when I saw that Poppy Austin Vitamin C serum also had hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil I knew I had to try it.  When it arrived to my house I started using it every morning after my skincare routine but before I applied my sunscreen and makeup.  I have to say my skin looks and feels amazing.  I noticed that I was getting fine lines forming on the top of my forehead (gasp!!) and was trying desperately to get rid of them.  When I started using this product I noticed that they diminished a bit and really looked less noticeable.  While we all know that nothing you do (expect a face lift) will get rid of lines and wrinkles however there are things we can use like hyaluronic acid that can really help to mask them.  And yes this works like any other product; if you stop using it then your lines will 're-appear'.  So lets talk about the ingredients.Hyaluronic Acid is found naturally in the human body and seen tremendously in babies.  Ever wondered why babies and small children always look like they have beautiful supple plumpy skin?  Well its because of hyaluronic acid.  Its a major component of skin tissue that give babies this effect.  Skin in general holds about fifty percent of your body&#;s hyaluronic acid in it.  However as we get older we loss a lot of it and thus aging takes it toll.  Hyaluronic Acid  plumps and moisturizes skin as well as it helps to heal and comfort it when its damaged. Hyaluronic Acid also prevent fine lines and wrinkles from forming and helps the skin by retaining moisture and creating a cushion to help plump them out as we age.Another thing that I love about this product as stated earlier is that it contains jojoba oil.  Jojoba oil is actually not an oil but a wax ester.  Because it is a wax ester it is hypothesized that jojoba oil is very comparable to human skin oil which manipulates the skin into thinking it has produced enough and balances out oil production.  Thus helping to give you only the added oil you need for your face and stopping the over production of sebum.  It is also not an antioxidant so it won't expire or go bad in a few months.  It is stable in that regard.  It also adsorbs well into the skin and doesn't leave it sticky greasy or just plain nasty.Finally the seller for me here was the Vitamin C.  Vitamin C is an antioxidant that is used to protect and help the face from wrinkles sun damage signs of aging dark spots and brighten your complexion amongst other great benefits. Vitamin C can also help to prevent or treat hyperigmentation defend against free radicals and brighten your skin. However with all the advantages of vitamin C the only draw back is that because it is an antioxidant it oxidizes itself very quickly and once this happens it is no longer good. You will be able to tell by the color when this happens to your product. It normally starts off clear and then turns yellow.Based on all these amazing properties is while I love love this product.  That and the product comes in a serum form in a dark bottle with a droplet in order to help it for oxidizing and bacteria.  Once Vitamin C hits air and light it starts to breakdown so its good to see that Poppy Austin nailed it by packaging it correctly!I just love Poppy Austin and plan to try out more of their products!

The serum has a faint fresh perfume scent. It is kind of hard to describe but it's a very pleasant and I love it. It's easy to apply on the skin and you only need a few drops to cover your entire face. A little goes a long way so you'll save up on this serum. My skin absorbed it right away and it instantly felt velvety soft and smooth. I also noticed a big difference on my dark circles and dark spots. They are lighter and the dark spots are less visible now. This serum really works! It's effective!,long way
I have tried many serums expensive designer serums and expensive natural serums. This one works perfectly. It works everyday. It's a pleasure to use. It isn't sticky or tacky felling no irritation or perfumery or chemical odor. I'm so glad I have it! I'm on my second bottle! I've already been using it for two months. It's amazing to find a much better priced product that is all natural and WORKS!!! Magic in a bottle! No more fines lines and smooth as silk.,Neutral
No perfume or overpowering smell went on smooth. Didn't make my face break out. Perfect to travel with! I recommend this product! Very impressed,Neutral
This Dove Leave In Foam works well to add a little hold to my hair.  When I use this I don't have to use much hair spray when styling my hair - this give just enough hold without leaving my hair heavy or crunchy.  The scent is nice and while I can smell it through out the day it's a nice clean scent it doesn't have a strong perfume scent. Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam,Neutral
This leave-in moisture foam works best for me (I have mens short to medium length hair) when applied to damp hair combing through and letting it air dry on its own. The end result provides a slightly wet look with some added volume and surprising hold that can last the entirety of a day if mostly indoors. Also appreciated is the light foam quality to the product that applies very easily to the hair and washes out just as quickly to boot. This is a nice styling option when you're in the mood for something subtle with light hold and lasting moisturizing effects. There is a soapy perfumed scent to this that is noticeable if you're sensitive to it - but nothing too extreme in my opinion. Cheap and versatile,Neutral
If I were looking for perfume for my hair then this would be a great choice because I really like the smell of it.  Unfortunately that's all it does for me and my daughter.  My hair is long and wavy but limp and dull at the top so I hoped to give it a lift.  If there's any lift to my hair you can't tell it.  My -year-old daughter's hair is completely opposite from mine.  Her's is long and straight.  She could certainly use some lift but unfortunately she had the same results.  Or should I say no results.The good thing is this product won't leave your hair greasy or stiff or anything like that.  In fact you can't tell anything was added at all.  Therefore it really doesn't help for styling purposes either.Unfortunately this isn't a product I can recommend. Smells Good but Does Nothing...,Neutral
Moisturizing and volumizing are often at odds with one another.  And frankly well I don't like the feeling of dry hair I'm not usually too bothered by most shampoos and rarely do I feel the need for more volume either!  But this is a solid product - my hair feels clean and not left with residue and my hair doesn't feel flat or too dry either.  The shampoo's scent is pleasant without being overpowering or too perfumey.  It's a fair shampoo representation of Dove bar soap in fact . . . so if you like that you'll like this! Very good,Neutral
The first thing that put me off is the fact that the top was off the bottle and  percent of the contents was spilled into the padded envelope and my mailbox. It took me a half hour to clean everything up and find I actually had enough left to wash my hair.The shampoo is thick and creamy and smells really fresh not perfumed. It suds up thicker than my usual shampoo but I didn't feel like it cleaned as well. My hair felt thicker but like it was coated. After drying my hair it was quite a bit more tangled but I didn't use a conditioner. Once completely dry my hair did feel softer and fuller. Even the next day my very curly hair feels soft.Maybe it takes some getting used to. Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo,Neutral
Very nice shampoo. Clean smelling lightly scented-pleasant-not over powering.  No awful heavy perfumes here-guys like it.  It just cleanses and gets the job done in a superior way.Gentle cleansing for hair lathers nicely.A little goes a long way. Favorable response by both men and women.Conclusion: Nice product. Would get again. Superior shampoo for both men and women.,long way
I have been using this with its companion conditioner exclusively and I feel that it works well.  It leaves my hair manageable with bounce and body.  I did think it would be a little more moisturizing than it is though but my main qualm is with the scent.  It's a super sweet synthetic perfume type of smell that I just don't enjoy.  I really prefer natural scents or at least naturally inspired scents.  The smell largely rinses out after shampooing so there's no lingering perfume smell. Works Well,Neutral
I have short hair so just one pump of the creamy foamy liquid is enough to condition my hair effectively. The texture is like whipped cream distributes evenly into my hair and rinses out easily. However I find the scent rather strong - more like a perfume than a hair product and probably spend longer than normal rinsing it out so that I don't have that lingering scent the rest of the day. A Little Goes a Long Way,long way
I like this product fine.  It's not as scented as I normally like - I like a heavy scent.  I have long hair and like to catch a whiff of it if I toss my head.  This one is barely noticable after my hair dries.This one is pleasant to smell a bit feminine and leaves hair smelling fresh if someone sticks their nose in your hair but not really perfumed.  Some may like it better for that.It works ok.  It reminds me of when I use a light inexpensive conditioner and THEN add some hair oil (like macadamia nut or something) before drying my hair.  It leaves my hair shiny and soft with fewer fly-aways and lots of body.It's really ok.  I'd buy it again if I found a good deal on it but it is not one of my preferred brands. Reminds me of using a hair oil,Neutral

About / c. of conditioner was lost because it was all over the inside of the envelope.  What a mess!  I hope this doesn't happen to you.  I'm sure amazon would gladly have taken it back if I had bought it but I received it free as part of the Amazon vine program so that wasn't an option for me. Works Well,Neutral
The journey from naturally dark brown to blonde and back again took its toll on my finemedium length hair. The inclusion of macadamia and coconut oil held the promise of the silky healthy hair that has eluded me for years. The conditioner has a pleasing consistency and a fairly strong perfume aroma that dissipates after use. It applied smoothly and rinsed out with ease. My hair was nicely conditioned but on a par with other conditioners in its price point. It is an adequate not exceptional conditioner and the addition of the exotic oils failed to elevate its performance. Not bad but it is unlikely I would go out of my way to use another bottle. Exotic Oils Fail To Elevate.,Neutral
This does a pretty good job of softening and helping my hair stay nice. It's most striking feature to me though is the coconut in its scent. It's more mellow than a lot of the very flowery stuff meant for women which is a plus if you try to go easy on the perfumes or you're just not in the mood. Generally speaking coconut isn't my favorite but that's just personal preference and not an issue with the product.There's nothing really bad about it it just also doesn't stand out in a big way either. It's a perfectly reasonable product for what it is. Definitely Coconut,Neutral
The Dove Pure Care Dry Oil conditioner is formulated for dull dry hair. I definitely have dull dry hair. My hair is dry coarse and frizzy all on it's own but now my hair is damaged from recent hair coloring and it's in even worse condition. The bottle says &#;nourishing oils can enhance silkiness and shine without being greasy or weighing hair down. The conditioner is definitely non-greasy and did not weight my hair down as advertised. On the other hand I didn't feel like my hair was any more silky or shiny than when I use any other conditioner.It's not a bad conditioner but to me it's just average. I also do not care for the scent. The scent is slightly spicy powdery and perfume-y all at the same time. Average Conditioner Don't Care for the Scent,Neutral
I am a sucker for hair products so of course grabbed this when it became available. I should have skipped it. At first I thought Hey cool it smells like baby powder but then something else kicked in and WOW it has a VERY strong perfume-y scent. Bad enough that it made me want to wash my hair again to get rid of it. It literally made me scrunch up my nose and squint my eyes. And I could almost live with that IF it was a good conditioner--but it felt like super cheap conditioner in my hair. Normally conditioner has a FEEL to it in your hair but this stuff felt like it never even coated the hair (and of course I used way more than recommended as I have thick hair). After rinsing my hair didn't feel any different either--it felt like it does after shampooing. And the scent lingered even after I towel-dried and blow-dried. NO THANK YOU. Super perfume-y scent and not a great conditioner,Neutral
This is a very creamy white conditioner with what is to me a mild to moderate perfume strenth leaning towards mild.  It's a fairly feminine clean floral modern scent that is nice.It absolutely leaves my long hair silky to the max.  I had my son feel it and he said &#;It feels like a Halloween wig.&#;  I thought maybe that was bad but he explained &#;No I mean that good- it's like it's brand new never out of the bag or tangled once.&#;  Yes my hair is UBER soft.It's thick and creamy - it feels almost like cold cream going on.  It rinses easily and I didn't notice any extended drying time for an air-dry.  (Some conditioners will make my hair take all night to dry this one did NOT.)it doesn't weigh hair down and it leaves it with lots of volume.My ONLY complaint is that it did leave my hair with tons of frizzy fly-aways and I normally don't have a lot.  At first I didn't notice it I just knew there was SOMETHING about it that was keeping me from loving this conditioner but after using it for a few days that got worse and worse.  I added some smoothing serum and now it's better but that is a drawback to me.It dries with a good bit less scent than when it is applied.  The fragrance lasts about a day. Leaves hair silky,Neutral
I want to love this conditioner. I think it makes my hair feel nice but it smells like old lady perfume. So strong and potent that I just can't breathe when I use it. I gave it three stars because like I said as a conditioner it does a great job - but that smell...yikes. Dove's other shampoo's/conditioners have a lovely soft scent so why did they go all 'powdered old woman' scent with this?Gross skip it because the scent makes it not worth it otherwise it is fine...but at the price point you can choose something that smells better and does the same job. Mehhh...the smell...,Neutral
This is a highly-concentrated conditioner. A small amount goes a long way.It conditions well leaving a very clean feeling.The perfume is light.All in all a fine product that should work well for others if my experience is representative. Fine Conditioner,Neutral
I'm a big fan of Clean products and this nourishing conditioner really works. First and foremost it smells fantastic. Nice and fresh and clean. Not perfume smelling at all. It makes my hair feel healthy and well hydrated. With continued use you can really notice the difference. Works great!,Neutral
This is a highly-concentrated shampoo. A small amount goes a long way.I applied the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration conditioner following the shampoo. However the shampoo also conditions to a significant extent. One might well choose to forego conditioner or at least not apply every time when applying this shampoo.The perfume is light.All in all a fine product that should work well for others if my experience is representative. Fine Shampoo,Neutral
Sometimes it's difficult to tell the effect of a shampoo when you also use a conditioner. The way I generally test a shampoo is to look mainly at how well it cleans my scalp but also to use both the shampoo and conditioner one day while using only the same conditioner (no shampooing) the next day. I could tell that this had a significant effect on the texture of my hair because it was softer after a combination of both the shampoo and conditioner than just the conditioner alone.In terms of how it left my scalp it did a serviceable job with one shampoo but as is so often the case no matter how thoroughly I scrub the shampoo into my scalp repeating did a better job than just doing it once. I'm guessing this has something to do with how particles build up on your scalp than anything else but I have this issue with all shampoos not just this one.This smells very pleasant and doesn't leave a strong perfumey scent behind (which is very important to me as strong scents make me sneeze). It does appear to improve moisture in your hair as it keeps down frizzies while still holding body. I should say that I have a lot of hair though - very long and thick - so it takes a pretty heavy product to weigh it down. I don't know how it would affect someone with finer hair.The price point on this at present (around $.) puts it in the ballpark of most mid-level common consumer shampoos. However at the time of this review Walmart has it available for $. so you can do a bit better on the pricing if you shop around. If you've got dry or thick hair and want something a cut above the lowest price product this is a very decent option. leaves hair soft,Neutral
I have a medium length thick hair that has been highlighted.  I have a normal scalp and dryer ends.  I used this product a couple times even though I felt it had a perfume-y chemical smell to it.  Everyone's sense of smell is different.  I tend to go for fresh natural scents in my products like the smells of Aveda products.Though this product is reasonably priced and is a good value it didn't work for me due to the smell and the consistency of my hair.  I like Tresemme  day Keratin Treatment Shampoo and Conditioner  better and it is cheaper.  If I use the conditioner with a shower cap on after application and continue my shower I find it works better than this mask.I also use Fekai Technician Color Care Luxe Color Masque for a more hydrating conditioner.  Though this product is more expensive it lasts a long time and is well worth the money.  If your hair is like mine and tends to tangle this was also no help in that department.  Hope this helps with your decision making. Fair,long time
This nourishing mask is a little thicker than regular conditioner and has a pleasant not-too-distinct smell. I left it on for a little more than the three minutes the label says to and my hair was easy to comb through (its usually knotty) and smooth. I can run my fingers through my hair with no snags... pretty cool! The scent has lingered for a few hours but hasn't bothered me (I get migraines from many perfumes). Great value. Nice hair mask,Neutral
I didn't expect much out of this product but it's doing a nice job at keeping my normally coarse dry hair under control and super soft. And the smell if wonderful. Not too perfumed but clean. Another added benefit is that when I use this I don't need any other product afterward i.e. hair serum (which I normally need for my frizzy hair). I use it about twice a week but I believe they recommend at least once a week. I would recommend to those with coarse thick hair. Super soft and shiny hair,Neutral
I just love Caress Body Washes my yr old daughter and I pick a different one every few weeks and have yet to be disappointed. I see several people here complaining that the scent doesn't last on their skin... I suppose I might be in the minority with this but I don't want it to. I love the smells during my shower they remind me of a spa or vacation... but once I'm out and dried off I have my usual lotions or perfume to wear and don't want to walk around smelling like whatever scent I opted to use in the shower.They lather well my skin feels clean without being dried out and they are a good value for the size of the container. You do need to be careful when opening them though I've had them splash up into my face and this one in particular burned my eye so badly when a tiny drop got in it that I had to end my shower and my eye hurt for hours after rinsing it out... so be mindful of that and don't use these on any young children who might get them in their eyes. Excellent spa-like scent makes showering enjoyable and doesn't linger,Neutral
Love this body wash. Fresh and clean skin is important as well as smooth and moisturiezed and this Aqua Sparkle does all of that. The fragrance is light and does not interfer with body lotions sprays or perfume. After showering I felt clean and refreshed. Will purchase again AQUA FRESH,Neutral
I had used Caress products in the past but with switching to liquid body wash I no long bought Caress.  Now that I've tried this product I am a Caress customer again.  This body wash is very rich and lathers nicely.  I absolutely love the strong scent while showering especially since it doesn't linger on your skin afterwards and compete with your perfume.  My skin feels soft and clean after use. caress body wash,Neutral
What can be said about body wash? It's a nice thick consistency and it works up into a nice lather. I can't say that the aroma is particularly strong. If you actually sniff the bottle you'll get a whiff of gardenia but it's not a very strong smell as you shower. Two hours later my skin doesn't have a slight lingering floral scent if I sniff myself which I rarely do and I suppose this is all to the good because I work with people who have to open all the windows if someone's wearing perfume. So as body wash goes this is a very nice product. Well it is body wash...,Neutral
With a name like Juicy Escape I thought it would be a fruity scent.  I've never used any Caress either and thought it would be a sudsier body wash.  The scent was no where near fruity - more like an older lady's perfume that she's had forever.  It's the same scent I remember smelling in my Aunt Wanda's house when I was a little girl and I'm  now.This could be great for girls that are into the floral scents JUST floral scents there's no hint of a fruity note in here.I'll use the rest of the bottle the scent doesn't linger on your skin or clothes after the shower but I would not pay for it personally! Not many suds and it stinks!,Neutral
This is a nicely scented body wash.  It lathers nice and rinses off well.  The scent on my skin is not too strong and doesn't clash with any perfume or scent I might wear during the day.It's a nice big bottle which is easy to open and will last for a while.  Nice product! Caress Body Wash Juicy Escape,Neutral
One of the biggest drawbacks to anti-dandruff shampoo is that it is so darn unpleasant.  I just finished a bottle of Dove Men+Care Fortifying Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and I just hated the way it smelled!  I certainly don't want my hair to smell perfumey but it would be nice to have a fresh and clean scent.  The Clear Men Scalp & Hair -in- Anti-Dandruff Shampoo (say that three times fast) addresses that complaint perfectly!  I tried the Citrus Fresh Hydration formula and it had a pleasant and extremely clean smelling aroma.  Nothing was overpowering but it left me feeling ready for the day.I don't know a lot about the science of anti-dandruff shampoos so I'll just say that this brand did seem to keep the flakes away.  The active botanical ingredients include Tea Tree Mint and Ginseng but the special Bio Nutrium  labeling promises a blend of  nutrients (including the ones listed above).  I don't rave about practical products.  If something does what it's designed to do I'll give it four stars.  But I genuinely liked this shampoo and would definitely seek it out for purchase.  For me that's the highest praise I can give so here's five stars.  KGHarris /. An Anti-Dandruff Shampoo That Actually Leaves Your Hair With A Fresh Scent,Neutral
Clear products have sort of taken over at my local stores.  I've found that the women's scents sometimes smell like cheap perfume so I recommend the &#;Men&#; scents which are more aptly unisex to everyone.  They use the standard anti-dandruff (pyrithione zinc) ingredient so you probably already know how well they will work for you in that respect.  This citrus scent is particularly nice with a sort of herbal background.  Dandruff shampoos can leave my scalp dry and itchy and my hair more dry and brittle than usual.  That is somewhat the case here but the conditioner does a good job of combating it.  Overall my favorite Clear -in- so far. Clear's Best Fragrance,Neutral
My husband has used the Clear Men's Scalp & Hair shampoo & conditioner for a few weeks to see how it compares to Head & Shoulders (which is the brand he's used for the last few years).  He uses dandruff shampoo with conditioner to control flakes that occur because of dry scalp and H&S; shampoo with conditioner has served well to control his dandruff ever since he started using it.The Clear shampoo compares favorably to H&S;: it's thicker and lathers more than H&S; and it seems to control his dandruff just as well. His hair feels clean and soft though I don't think that's any different than before.The Citrus Fresh scent is nice and most importantly it's not overpowering like the perfumes in some shampoos so if you like this scent or one of the others that are offered you won't have to worry about the scent of your hair announcing your entrance to a room! Major bonus is that I like it much better than any of the H&S; scents he's used even their citrus one. His hair smells good all day long (without triggering an asthma attack for me) which it didn't with H&S.; I am fussier about the smell of his shampoos and deodorants than he is so he has me pick them out for him! This one gets a thumbs up from both of us.We recommend this shampoo and he will likely stick with it over H&S; even though it's slightly more expensive. Smells nicer than Head & Shoulders and works a bit better,Neutral
Out of the box this soap has a wonderful fresh scent - not too strong but pleasant and appealing - and is a nice blue-green color (close to that of the box). I was worried the scent might be too strong and linger too much (and compete with perfumes or cologne) but it is just right. It lathers well is non-drying and leaves just enough of a scent that you feel fresh as well as clean. Especially during these lingering winter days I appreciate that this does not dry out my skin. The signature curved Caress bar is easy to grasp and also allows for faster drying when placed back in a soap dish. I do love the fresh new scent and guests have commented on it as well. Adds a nice pick-me-up to anyone's bathing routine. Exhilarating fresh scent in a non-drying bar soap,dry skin
I've used Caress before - it's a decent bath soap gentle and moisturizing good for sensitive or dry skin. I borrow my wife's soap and shampoo occasionally and I'm fairly tolerant of most of the scents that they use.This new variety of Caress however &#;Emerald Rush&#;  is quite strongly scented with a heavy floral aroma of gardenia. It also contains &#;white tea&#; whose advantages I'm not quite aware of: a scent an emollient or just a trendy ingredient?  Anyway there are probably some women out there who will like the scent but as for me I prefer something more neutral or &#;manly&#;. Too Perfumey for This Guy,dry skin
I prefer bath soap bars to shower gels or other body wash so I was eager to try this new scent from Caress. I love fragrances and this one is very fresh and pleasant lathers well and seems to rinse off cleanly. I have very dry skin from using extremely hot water during the cold winter months in the Midwest so I am always wanting a bar soap that is not going to further suck the moisture from my skin. Although this is not labeled as a moisturizing soap it seemed to leave my skin soft and the scent does indeed linger but not so overwhelmingly so that it interferes with cologne or perfume or other products if you use them as well.A nice little bonus is that the bars you're not using will make your closet or drawer smell really good too! I'll definitely buy this again. Smells great!,dry skin
I didn't expect to see a soap that was so BRIGHT TEAL!  WOW.  A very very colorful bar and fragrant too.  When I got them in their pack they smelled up my entire bathroom with a pretty and perfumed scent.  The scent is pretty with an older feminine flair (read: my grandmother would have probably loved this).When the soap is used it does not leave a heavy perfume smell on.  It also really helps to moisturize like other Caress bars do.Why did I knock a star off?  The color.  The crazy vivid teal color that seems just a little over the top and makes it seem way more artificial than it really is.  They could have dialed down the color a bit with no loss of benefit I am sure.  The extreme color as is is just so unnatural. Very fragrant at first loses fragrance quickly - and the color!!!,Neutral
I use these bars of soap in the shower daily. I really like the clean and fresh fragrance they have and the clean feeling they leave me with. The scent is good for either a man or woman..more soapy and clean smelling and not overly perfumed. Great every day soap! Fresh and clean fragrance for men or women and a good clean wash,Neutral
This is a nice soap and carries a heavy scent the scent of gardenia and white tea essence.  The package says it is made in the USA and comes from Unilever in Connecticut. The actual bar measures approximately  / long X  / wide X &#; deep.  This is a soap for someone who likes to smell like they just came out of the shower.  If you like that perfume like smell you should like this soap. A Scented Gardenia and White Tea Essence Bar Soap,Neutral
I've been a long-time fan and user of Caress soap so I thought I'd give this new scent a try. I was pleased to find that the soap works as well as the Caress I'm used to. It lathers very well (though the bluish color of the suds took a bit of getting used to) and it rinses nicely. I have skin that tends towards dry and has to deal with both the Florida sun and hard water on a daily basis so moisture retention is important to me but other soaps - even moisturizing bars - either don't rinse well enough and leave my skin with a slimy feel or completely dry me out. Caress has always been a cost-friendly reliable choice for my household.I'd love to say that this new Emerald Rush scent was a perfect fit given all that but unfortunately this scent didn't work for me. It's very strong which wouldn't be at all bad if I liked how it smelled. I'm sad to say I don't. It's very floral too floral for my tastes and rightly or wrongly it reminds me of a perfume my grandmother wore when I was a little girl.For those who like the scent I think this would be a great choice. It does work as reliably and nicely as the Caress I'm used to. This particular scent just isn't for me. I'll go back to the original and be happier for it. Works Great but the Scent...,Neutral
I was pleased to find the scent is very light. I was afraid it would be too perfumey. It suds up nicely and feels really nice. It's easy to wash off and doesn't leave me feeling dry. It really is very fresh feeling and smelling. A little goes a long way so it will last pretty long and help save me some money. Caress emerald rush body wash,Neutral
I chose this body wash because I liked the ingredients and the scent as it was described.  The scent was exactly as I expected but a bit more subtle than I like.  I normally use a competitor's products because of the strongly scented body was and bubble bath.  However if you like a light scent that is beautiful but won't compete with your antiperspirant or perfume.  I found that the body wash created lots of lovely suds with my bath sponge.  I'm going to keep using this lovely product and I'm also going to try it out as a bubble bath.  I will be purchasing more. Beautifully Scented Body Wash,Neutral
The body wash was refreshing It left my skin smooth and fresh as well as clean. Lathers up well so you do not have to use a lot at one time. I use a puff so it will lather up even more with just a few dabs. The fragrance is light and does not interfere with perfume or cologne. Gardenia usually has a  pretty strong distinctive sweet smell but I found this product was not heavy with aroma.  The bottle is a good size at  ounces and the price is comparaitve to other brands. REFRESHING,Neutral
I have always loved Caress soap and their body wash is great too.  I don't care for things that are too overpowering in the perfume department.  This is a lovely amount of gardenia and white tea.  It is a perfect blending for a very fresh clean scent.  Most of us don't have time for anything but a shower so I use body washes all the time.  This one will not disappoint and even if you want to relax in a hot tub with your favorite bath puff you will be glad you bought this product.  Caress has been around for a while and I trust this brand.  They have a lot of other fragrances if this one is not your cup of tea. (No pun intended) So try them I would highly recommend them. Loved this product!,Neutral
This is a nice thick white soap like liquid pearls in the hand. It lathers up well into a good foam -- I actually shaved my legs for a change. The aroma isn't very strong. It's been a while since I've smelled lilacs but I don't think they smiled like this. That being said the floral aroma light though it was does linger a bit on the skin but isn't noticeable so that it would bother people with perfume allergies. Even more exciting I showered with it this morning because my hands itched so badly with what I hope is a temporary pollen allergy to the oak bloom this season.  Now my hands thankfully are free of that dreadful itching so this product works better for washing than whatever generic handsoap is available to me at work. A very nice product,Neutral
Judging by the title I thought it would smell a little like Irish Spring because of its green color but I was disappointed that it has a scent that's so mild I could barely notice it.  On the positive side it lathers well and it is cost-effective - just a few drops of gel go a long way.  TThis wash isn't irritating to my skin and so I will continue to use it. I'm not a fan of heavily perfumed body washes but it would be nice if the scent were just a little bit stronger.  Since gemstones aren't associated with a particular scent I think &#;Emerald Rush&#; as a name is fairly meaningless. It's a decent product but there is nothing that would make me go out of my way to buy it again (unless it were heavily discounted). Lathers Well and Doesn't Have a Strong Scent.  Good But Not Special,little bit
I used the shampoo once and It makes a nice lather and leaves hair soft and clean.  My issue is that it is highly fragranced from I'm assuming the white orchid infusion.  It is really overpowering.  I ended up shampooing again later that day just to get rid of the heavy fragrance.  I don't care for shampoos or any hair product that leaves a strong fragrance after use.  I am very sensitive to perfumes of any kind.  If you enjoy a sort of musky white orchid fragrance in your shampoo this would most likely be a choice you'd enjoy but it is simply not for me. Very Strong Fragrance,Neutral
This shampoo Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid has a great scent and really bubbles up! It is not harsh in the least however. As well it actually has a light leave in conditioner available here (last time I looked) which you can buy to match the fragrance of this shampoo. I use them both together!I live in New York which I am beginning to think is never going to warm up (we have temperatures twenty degrees below normal today). Arguably the next best thing to booking a flight across the country is to get in a wonderful comforting shower and pretend you are in the state of Hawaii which of course has all those yummy Macadamia nuts and all those beautiful Orchids!  Try taking a trip in your mind by using power of Suave!  This product's smell isn't so strong that you will have a fragrance fight on your hands concerining the perfume (or body lotion)  you may choose after your shower. In fact my  year old son tried this shampoo last night and was very happy with the results on his long hair. He didn't say a word about the smell.I do believe in the positive benefits of aromatherapy however I am no expert.Then again I cannot imagine anyone not liking the smell of this!Additionally if you like to pamper yourself with your shampoo choices but don't want to spend zillions of bucks on the fancier spa brands go for Suave. I do every single time!thanks and Aloha!jean I love Suave products and love how they have the most delicious fragrances which match other hair treatments which they offer!,Neutral
This shampoo has no parabens and no dyes but its main ingredients are water and petroleum derivatives like most shampoos. With that said it's a good shampoo. The texture in use is unusually silky the scent is lush but not lingering (so it won't fight with your perfume) and it leaves your hair clean and healthy.If you have both males and females in your household you probably need to keep this for the girls and get the guys something with a less feminine scent. Effective Economical Everyday Shampoo,Neutral
I should begin by saying that I am an enormous fan of the &#;infusion&#; line by Suave. The Morroccan infusion line is a favorite of mine and I was really looking forward to trying this but the perfume scent was very very strong. What was worse was that it lingered the next day. I only wash my hair every other day and when I got it wet and conditioned it the strong perfume scent re-asserted itself. I was also disappointed to find that this left my head feeling itchy the next day (I wash at night). I guess it's just not playing well with my body chemistry. Usually Suave's shampoo works a dream for me but this one did not. too perfumey for me,Neutral
I love the smell of this shampoo! Not fruity or too sweet. Not overly scented or perfumey. It really makes my hair soft and manageable and the ends aren't so dry. My hair is easy to comb out when it's wet and doesn't get as tangled when it's dry. In fact I like it so well I bought the conditioner which also works very well. Unfortunately when I use the shampoo and conditioner together my hair is so soft it's flat. It doesn't appear greasy it's just not fluffy and lively. I've combined them with other shampoos and conditioners and I do like the outcome better than when I use them together.If you have coarse hair that you would like to tame I think this shampoo would work very well for you but it might be too much for fine or thin hair. The only way to know of course is to give it a try. I am going to continue to use it but with other conditioners. Smells Wonderful!,Neutral
This one has taken me by surprise by turning out to be one of my favorite shampoos I've tried. I switch around pretty regularly because I get bored of the same scents and styles easily and sometimes I like to use products intended for men when I want a milder scent or something that's not too flowery. This has been doing a really good job of leaving my hair light and soft and not making me feel like I've been doused in perfume. I was expecting it to be just okay but it's turned out to be something I really like. Good stuff!,Neutral
Check out this price and compare it to anything you would buy at the grocery store.  It's a bargain for . ounces of shampoo and you only need a small amount each time.  The creamy white shampoo does not lather up much but does manage to clean thoroughly.  You also don't have to leave it in to get the conditioning effect.  My dandruff is gone but that's because this solution moisturizes to the point that my already fine hair lays flat - it droops.  It does not present a voluminous result.  However if your hair is thick and unruly this might work for you.  I also use it on my beard and I no longer have dandruff when I scratch it.As far as a scent goes I can't really notice anything much at all.  I like that as there have been so many times I am stuck in an elevator with women who has used WAY too much of a perfumed shampoo or spray that have to hold my breath in fear of vomiting on the poor persons feet. It Works Almost Too Well,Neutral
My husband had already tried the CLEAR Citrus Fresh scent version of this shampoo and we liked it better than Head & Shoulders so he decided to try this scent as well. He uses dandruff shampoo with conditioner to control flakes that occur because of a dry scalp and H&S; shampoo with conditioner has served well to control his dandruff ever since he started using it.The Clear shampoo compares favorably to H&S;: it's thicker and lathers more than H&S; and it seems to control his dandruff just as well. His hair feels clean and soft though I don't think that's any different than before.The Ocean Mineral scent is nice but not as pleasant as the Citrus Fresh scent. Neither is overpowering like the perfumes in some shampoos so if you like this scent or one of the others that are offered you won't have to worry about the scent of your hair announcing your entrance to a room or triggering an asthma attack for your sensitive spouse (aka me)! It smells much better and more natural than Head & Shoulders. My husband's hair smells good all day long which it didn't with H&S.; I am fussier about the smell of his shampoos and deodorants than he is so he has me pick them out for him! This one gets a thumbs up from both of us.We recommend this shampoo and he will likely stick with it over H&S; even though it's slightly more expensive. The only problem is that it's been hard to find them locally so far so we will end up ordering them here on Amazon. better than Head & Shoulders; I prefer the Citrus Fresh scent,Neutral
I use Suave kid's cherry vanilla scented mousse for my son's hair and his product seems eerily similar in appearance.  The first  main ingredients of each product were the same and the rest of them were similar.Basically the kid's mousse is mousse without alcohol in it... so it's texture is a less dense foam than regular mouse.  More like soap bubbles than shaving cream.  This product does not advertize itself as mousse rather as a &#;leave in foam&#;.  But in reality I think they are basically the same thing... just marketed differently with different perfume scents.  Price wise- this is more expensive than the kid's mousse (which I have used on my own hair because it's less sticky) but they work the same.If you are not one who cares about labels or need a specific adult-smelling product and you want to try this stuff... maybe you should try the Suave Kid's Mousse first.That being said this IS a good product.  It is less sticky than regular mousse and doesn't feel as weighty.  You don't have that crunchy feeling either if you use a lot of it.  So that is why I am giving  stars.  I just felt like I should point out the other stuff. Seems a lot like kid's mousse,Neutral
Foam disappears into your hair static disappears.The smell is so great I wish they made shampoo with this scent.  There used to be a suave with Lotus petals but they discontinued it.This is better than perfume! You do have to use alot to get your hair scented but it's worth it. Works great on static smells delicious,Neutral
When you have baby fine hair like mine getting it to look full can be a challenge.While this didn't give the kind of volume that using a curling iron does it did indeed give a lift.The scent is light and doesn't interfere with your regular perfume or cologne.It's no miracle product but does as it claims. Gives a Lift when you're Limp,Neutral
The serum felt nice on your face (no oily residue) and it came with both a dropper and a pump nozzle so you can pick whichever you prefer. I prefer the pump personally. The smell is not terrible but it does not have a perfume like scent either. I like that it helps fade away sunspots and also prevent sun damage in the future.What I loved most about this product is that it has high quality ingredients is made in the USA AND has a ONE YEAR % back money guarantee if you do not like the results. Finally a company that CARES about its customers! The company will refund the price of the product and the shipping no matter where you purchased the product. I love products where the company takes care of you. Being honest and and faithful TO me is what makes me honest and faithful to a company. Works well to even out complexion,Neutral
Olay is the only brand of skin cream I use for many years now.  It makes my skin look and feel great unlike any other brands I've tried.  The difference is amazing with some of the Olay Creams.This comes in a more elegant jar than most of the Olay Creams and the jar comes in a nice box.  So right away you know this is a premium product.  The cream is light with a silky smooth texture and a light orange/peach color.  The scent is a very light peach/floral which fades away after a few minutes upon application.  I find the texture color and scent of this cream very pleasing.  It's a little perfumey but in a good way. In fact I would buy this scent as a perfume if I could.This has that water feel to it that better creams have.  By that I mean you can feel a cool water sensation when you apply them and they spread out and sink in immediately.  It also is whipped slightly making it airy and lightweight.I do not get a feeling of moisturization unless it's very slight.  I feel that this is more of a tone perfecting cream to even out the skin tone.  I noticed a definite difference in a few days in my more even skin tone and while I don't have noticeable dark areas my skin did seem to be more evenly tones and more glowy.  I was disappointed it wasn't more moisturizing.This did not clog my pores which is important to me.  It also works well under foundation since it's so light and smooth feeling.  I can feel the dimethicone in this that silky smooth feeling that makes makeup glide on and look smooth. There is the slightest bit of tackiness after I apply this a strange combination of that dimethicone silky smoothness combined with a tiny bit of stickiness.If you want help with your skin tone mostly this is an elegant way to even it out.  It's probably best to apply this morning and evening as the instructions in the box recommend. It does work well for that.  If you are looking for a moisturizer this isn't great for that.  And if you must have an unscented cream you won't like this.I alternate this every other night with my beloved Olay -in-One Night Cream.  It's a nice regimen that makes my skin look great. Elegant light moisture,Neutral
Im probably the target marketing audience for this product being a  year old woman.  I wasn't overly impressed.  To be fair it recommends that you use their whole line which I did not.  I ONLY used the tone perfecting cream.  I'll start with the positives...the cream is pleasant smelling without being overly perfumed.  It goes on smoothly and does indeed leave my face feeling hydrated.  Thats about where the positives end.  My skin is relatively sensitive and this didn't cause the reaction that some creams do but it did make my face red and slightly burny after use.  Fortunately it went away rather quickly.  I used it straight for  weeks and saw none of the claims the product packaging makes.  IMO it does no better than any other cream on the market.  That being said I didn't dislike it. however like many of the miracle cream products it didn't live up to the package claims.  The fact is as we get older we look older.  There isn't a magic cream on the market to make it go away.  Take care of your skin and it will prolong the visual signs.  That's about it. Just okay,Neutral
I live in a very dry climate and my skin gets so dry that it is almost painful sometimes (And I don't even have to look at my face that has to be worse.)To be honest no one has told me I look younger using this but my skin feels more supple.It is a very light cream and easy to apply.  It has more scent than I like but it didn't cause me to wheeze or anything (I'm pretty sensitive to perfumes)Price is moderate and very reasonable compared to some similar products that I don't really like any better.I am likely to purchase this regularly. Really relieves dry skin.,dry skin
I received this cream to try through Influenster and have been using it for a few days now. I really like the texture of the cream and how it quickly absorbs and isn't oily. It leaves a soft velvety/powdery feel on your skin. The only thing I don't like is the scent. It's very perfumey and a bit strong for me. I would prefer a non-scented version. I will definitely continue to use this cream since I don't experience any negative side-affects and hope that it'll help with my acne scars. Feels great on skin non oily but very strong scent,Neutral
My wife reviews: I have super sensitive skin and most perfumed products and some without perfume irritate my skin. My first night's use left me with no irritation so I was pleasantly surprised. My second night gave me slight irritation and still on the morning after I can tell that my skin's not % pleased. Most people are not as sensitive as me so this should not be taken as a condemnation - but if you DO have super sensitive skin this might not be a good fit for you. Probably okay for most people,sensitive skin
I gave this product a try to see if it'll do anything to get rid of the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks. I've been using it for almost  months. NO difference than from before I started using the product. And it kind of dries up my face a bit. Not much but I can tell the difference in my skin.I only thing I like about it is that it goes on smooth and leaves your face feeling nice and smooth. I can do without the fragrance though. Too many products with perfume in it that I can do without.If I can leave a product review on the Olay site I would. But you have to be a member to leave a review. Really?!? Didn't go a thing for hyper pigmentation,Neutral
Looking for a facial moisturizer that I can rotate with my more expensive brand. Proctor and Gamble tells us this 'tone perfecting cream' will recapture healthy looking youthful luminosity. My skin is in great condition. I have always taken care of my skin and I have good genes light skin with pink cheeks. What I want and need is to keep my skin well hydrated and glowing. I doubt I will see younger looking skin in  weeks but but sure does sound good.I have been using this tone perfecting cream for a couple of days. My skin does feel soft it has not lost the smoothness. I admit there may be more of a glow. The cream does feel good. I will be looking to see if my dark spots are reduced over time.My usual routine is to wash my face in the morning and evening. I apply a serum usually one with hyaluronic acid and then apply moisturizer. Morning and night thus is my regime. I never wear make-up to bed. In the morning I apply a light mineral foundation powder blush mascara and a light powder veil. In the evening after removing my mascara I apply my cleanser and then use a Clarisonic to remove the last vestiges of make-up then apply the serum and moisturizer. This has kept my skin in good stead. I will continue to use the Olay Regenerist Luminous and update with any improvements and observations.The only negative is the perfumery scent. It does dissipate quickly but is a negative for me.The list of ingredients is long have no idea what most if them are.full ingredientsWATER CYCLOPENTASILOXANE GLYCERIN NIACINAMIDE  ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE ACETYL GLUCOSAMINE DIMETHICONE DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER POLYETHYLENE PANTHENOL* TOCOPHERYL ACETATE*** PALMITOYL PENTA PEPTIDE-^ CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF EXTRACT^^ ALOE BARBADENS LEAF JUICE^^^ALLANTOIN SODIUM PEG- OLIVE OIL CARBOXYLATE ACRYLAMIDE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAUREATE COPOLYMER DMDM HYDANTOIN LAURETH- LAURETH-DIMETHICONOL SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE ACRYLATES/C- ALK ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER DISODIUM EDTA PEG- STEARATE IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE C- ISOPARAFFIN FRAGRANCE TITANIUM DIOXIDE YELLO RED .*VITAMIN B **PRO-VITAMIN B ***VITAMIN E ^AMINO-PEPTIDE ^^GREEN TEA ^^^ALOE VERARecommended. prisrob -- Smooth Toned,Neutral
After discovering last fall thatOlay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream . Ouncedid nothing for my skin except make it look dull I hoped maybe this luminous regenerist cream would work better.  And it did. I have been using it every night for weeks and my skin looks better and brighter.  I also wake up with no small lines around my eyes which only appear when using electric heat during cold weather.  The micro-sculpting regenerist cream did not prevent those lines.  This luminous cream has a nice light texture and only a light scent that quickly dissipates. (I am hypersensitive to perfume scents too.) Olay says to use it twice a day but I prefer usingCoverGirl & Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer -Ounceunder foundation during the day. So this is my night cream only and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to try a new night cream. Works Much Better Than The Other Regenerist Cream . . . .,Neutral
I have not even experimented with all the different ways that Moroccan Argan Oil is used for but it has already exceeded all of my highest expectations.As a  - Star Skin Treatment:I have dry skin and I have always had dry skin.  We moved to the Southwest Desert almost  years ago where the climate is dry and acrid and the condition of my skin became even drier.  I have also reached my sixties and with age your skin dries even more...you might call my situation a triple whammy!  I first started using the Argan Oil on my face right before my moisturizer.  Just three drops is sufficient for both my face and neck just a minute or two after the oil has been absorbed I apply my moisturizer.  I could probably skip the moisturizer as the Argan Oil is adequate for both softening and hydrating but as I have stated my skin is very dry and the climate here seems to strip all the moisture from skin and hair so the extra protection is necessary.  I now use it both morning and evening especially since I am in the process of derma-rolling six nights a week.  The evening application is extremely beneficial because a derma-rolling session strips out all the natural facial oils leaving face red raw sensitive and dried out.  The Argan Oil is soothing as it helps to replenish some of those stripped out oils.A  STAR Hair Repair Miracle!I have dry course textured colored treated thick hair that is about shoulder length.  My hair has always been a challenge no matter what climate I have lived.  I use to live in a very humid climate on the east coast and my hair was constantly frizzy out of control and needed to be beaten down with a brush on a daily basis.  Here in the dry desert where I now reside I also face `hair challenges' of a slightly different nature.  My hair is still dry and frizzy but with the lack of any humidity it has become limp and lifeless.My first experience with Argan Oil as a hair remedy happened under the worst conditions and the incredible transformation that the Argan Oil performed was nothing short of miraculous.  Due to the arrival of unexpected company I did not get the chance to use any moisturizing conditioner; I just wrapped my hair in a towel and it dried on its own all bunched up.  When I finally removed the towel my hair resembled a damp dried up mass of tangled tumbleweed.  It was late no time for a `do-over' so I poured a small amount of the Argan Oil into an empty perfume atomizer spritzed the hair with about five spurts piled it on my head proceeded with a brisk  second hair and scalp massage and prepared to attack the `tumbleweed' with my comb and brush.  Miracle # the Argan Oil was a hair detangler the wide tooth-comb glided through with ease.  Miracle # my hair was full bodied that does not happen often in a desert climate unless you're at the hair dresser.  Now I cannot claim that my hair was shiny silky and glossy because course textured hair generally does not have that characteristic unless one uses a silicone or other chemical product but it certainly was very smooth soft and manageable.This ends my review on Moroccan Argan Oil but if you wish to read further I have done some research on this fascinating product and the information below contains some interesting facts along with useful information.Interesting Argan Oil Facts* Argan oil is made with the nuts or the kernels of argan trees found in the hills in a rural town   hours away from Marrakesh.* For oil used in cosmetics the nut oil extracted is raw and native Berber women hand-process just one liter of argan oil every few days in a painstaking manner.

I have always loved the smell of Irish Spring soap and the green striped bar is pretty in my bathroom.Now Irish Spring comes in a liquid form.  I used it from top (hair) to bottom (toes) and was pleased with the way it cleaned everything.  The smell lasted after my shower.  I noticed it for a couple of hours but as with perfume you become accustomed to the fragrance so I don&#;t know how long it really lasted.The liquid is a bit thicker than other liquid soaps/bath gel I have used so it tends to go farther for less of the product.If you are a fan of the Irish Spring bar you will like the gel as well.

Wonderfully clean smell.  Rich lather.  Softeskin.  The clean smell is the perk here.  My husband uses this and I want to snuggle up.  It's a gentle clean subtle smell.It makes a good lather and keeps him clean and smells great.It's not as heavily perfumed as some men's washes but it's as sexy if not more so. Clean and fresh,Neutral
This Irish Spring body wash has a pleasant fresh scent and lathers nicely.  It leaves a light barely noticeable clean scent afterward that won't clash with any perfumes or colognes. I decided to try it due to the hydration claim.  Unfortunately it doesn't moisturize or hydrate any better than my other soaps.  In the interest of fairness and full disclosure I do have extremely dry skin.  Even scented Dove leaves my skin dry after an hour or so. I need a very special soap to prevent excessive dryness.  On someone with normal to mild dry skin it may work much better. Clean fresh yet subtle scent,dry skin
Irish Spring was the soap of choice in our house when I was growing up. I was excited to try the body wash and I was not disappointed. It has the same wonderful fresh scent we've come to expect from Irish Spring. It lathers beautifully and rinses clean. I love the way it leaves your skin with a hint of fragrance but isn't perfumey masculine or feminine. Just clean. Great Fragrance,Neutral
I use this as a daily moisturizer and its amazing! It makes my skin feel super smooth! I have sensitive skin and allergic to a lot of stuff and this oil didn't give ANY sort of reaction. This oil is great organic and natural product to use! It makes my skin feel so much healthier! Great product that everyone must use!Another great comment I must mention is that the odor disappears after a few minutes of application. I don't understand how but Ilove it! This is % virgin moroccan Argan oil with no perfumes. If you know your Argan oil you know they are not pleasant smelling unless the have perfumes added. However after rubbing this into my hair the odor magically disappears and I am felt with no harsh smelling scent.Argan oil has made my dry flaky skin look and feel much better with regular use and it has even reduced the itching. It has also improved the appearance of my cuticles with regular use. Lately I have been using it on the dry skin on my feet after I shower and it softens it and eliminates that ashy appearance. I do use it in my hair because my scalp is really dry and I have several friends who do.No matter if your hair is thick dry frizzy thick curly or just out of control - Argan oil will help.

I&#;ve never tried a facial mask but decided to give it a go for a change.  The Jayda Elizabeth which had a lovely light lavender scent was a really nice facial pick-me-up for a change of pace.  Of course many people use these all the time and swear by them.The application is perfect after showering or washing your face with warm water.  You simply put on a thing layer and let the Jayda Elizabeth do it&#;s magic for five or ten minutes before washing it off.  The feeling is actually quite luxurious and wonderful.After removing the Jayda Elizabeth Revitalizing Facial Mask my face not only looked cleaner but felt cleaner.  There&#;s nothing like enjoying a bit of creature comfort that doesn&#;t offer up a lot of calories or costs a minor fortune.  Although the price seems a tad steep there is enough to last for quite some time.FEATURES:&#;  Draws out impurities&#;  Nourishs and refreshes your skin&#;  Tightens and tones your skin&#;  Revitalizes your skin&#;  Helps heal blemishes&#;  Improves circulationYou don&#;t have to have any particular skin type to benefit from it.

I really like the scent of this...its a yummy almost dessert-like scent...not overpowering but just a light scent that is much better than any other night creams I normally use. (I'm not fond of the perfumey types and this one is not that) This moisturizer has a cream luxurious feel that I am now hooked on! And its not so oily/greasy like some creams - in the morning when I wake up my face is still smooth and feels moisturized without any greasy feel. Definitely a keeper for me! Love the scent!,Neutral
I recently had the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid from Insta Natural. One thing that I can say sets this serum apart from other similar serum is its scent. It does not have any perfumes or artificial scented additives in it but it has a faint sweet and natural herbal scent to it that smells wonderful. Since I began using this serum my face has felt softer than it has in many years. I have received compliments from friends and acquaintances about how great my skin looks and how young I look at my age. I have to give the credit to this wonderful serum which I am so happy to have found.I am so impressed with this product that I also began adding a few drops to my lotion so that I can use it on the rest of my body. I would definitely recommend this product to others. Customer service was very professional and answered my questions promptly&#; My package was delivered very quickly. What more could I ask for?! You'll Be Impressed!!!,Neutral
I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to feel clean and relaxed (I am reviewing the Lavender and Chamomile Relax version) and pampered.  It is wonderful smelling and cleans  wonderfully without  overly drying my skin. There is no heavy lingering aroma to interfere with you perfume or cologne.The natural ingredients out- weigh the few  man made ingredients so I am very happy about that.  This is made in the USA for a little added bonus.The only drawback - and it is a slight one - is that if you are using this in the shower instead of the tub the pump bottle can easily slip out of your hands.Sample provided for testing and review purposes. Lovely,Neutral
I'm a bit of a lotion hoarder always getting new bottles of different scents and trying out all different kinds. From thick body butters to thin moisturizers I have them all. The Energize fragrance in this Aqua Spa is unlike anything I've ever had before. The fragrance is totally different than anything I've tried. Normally when I get a lotion that's listed as a citrus scent it ends up being the typical orange fragrance or another similar scent. This Energize lotion is much more of a ginger fragrance than citrus. Very unique! I find the smell to be very true to the Energize name.It's a large bottle of lotion. Much bigger than I expected. It almost resembles the size of a bottle of shampoo. The lotion is thin enough to be easily absorbed by the skin. So it doesn't leave a greasy feeling on you. While the bottle is orange the lotion itself is white. So if you're sensitive to added dyes in products there doesn't appear to be any in this.You only need a little bit to get a lot of scent and it lingers on the skin for quite a while. It has a very clean smell to it. Not perfumey. So if you're looking for something different than the typical orange citrus lotion this is it!Sample provided for review Huge bottle and invigorating smell,little bit
I love love love this body creme. It's texture is soooo luxurious. It moisturizes my skin perfectly. It smells great and the scent stays with you for quite a while. The great thing about the fragrances they use is that they blend with and work well with any perfume I put on. this stuff is Amazing,Neutral
{Re} store hyaluronic moisturizing cream contains a blend of highly-effective ingredients to moisturize and protect the skin from drying while softening and plumping it to improve the texture and appearance.  It can be used on the delicate areas of the face as well as on problem areas such as the elbows.  My skin is very sensitive to some cosmetics but this formulation did not irritate it at all.It is a white moderately thick cream that quickly melts into the skin leaving it silky but not oily.  It has only a very neutral odor faint and inoffensive with no added perfumes.It can be used as an everyday moisturizer after bathing or washing the skin.  It is also very soothing when applied after using a natural facial peel such as{Re} Fresh Lactic Acid % Gel Peel.  Just a tiny dab will go a long way.The plastic screw-top jar is useful when emptied for holding stamps or a few pieces of jewellery when travelling.A sample was provided by {Re} Fresh  for testing and evaluation.

There are so many uses listed for rose water. I use it for the pretty scent. It's pleasant and light not weighed down like perfumes. It dries very quickly so I don't feel any moisturizing effects but there is a tingle of toning.I only wish the bottle was not open mouth. It would be so much easier to apply if there was a smaller drip spout or spray pump. If it had a spray pump I could spritz this all over. As it is I use a cotton ball but a spout or other dispenser would be much appreciated.This product was provided for review by InstaNatural. Pretty Scent,Neutral
I have never used rose water before but i heard great things and you know i just don't go by what others say i am more of a seeing is believing so when i was asked if i would like to try this of course i said yes! Everyone knows i am always skeptical about everything until i try it not once but twice i have used this since i got it yesterday but not twice  times yesterday and already once today after my shower i kept wondering where that amazing rose smell was coming from until i remembered i used the rose water the smell was me! I love it i am using it as a fast face wash in the morning and at night after i wash my face just as a toner i hear it's great for hair i read i may try that too! I am using it as a perfume because it smells so good! Thank you for letting me try this i love it! blown away!,Neutral
I would use the Insta Natural % Pure Moroccan Rose Water if for no other reason than the smell alone! The wonderful perfumey scent of roses will greet you as soon as you open the bottle! I was in love with this product just for that reason. But of course I had to check it out to see if there was more to it than just a wonderful scent!The Rose Water can be used for many purposes and I always appreciate a product that is good for more than just one thing. Some of these include:-Cleanser-Toner-Hydrator-Reduces sunburn-AromatheraphyI happened to get a sunburn the day after I received this so I decided to put it to the test. I used a cotton ball to apply it to my burnt shoulders. It felt cool and soothing to the touch and absorbed quickly into my skin. Since hydration is one of it's uses I was hoping it would rehydrate my skin and give it the moisture the sun took from it. I used it for a couple of days until the sunburn disappeared and my skin never peeled like it usually does so I'm guessing it really did hydrate. And it left me smelling like roses - literally!I also used it as a Toner on my face. I love the way it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into my skin. It is thin and watery in texture and smells amazing. The scent alone really does calm and sooth the senses and leave me with a feeling of peace.The % Pure Moroccan Rose Water is a great hydrator and Toner and cleanses at the same time while leaving you smelling amazing! It Will Leave you Smelling Like Roses,Neutral
With all the natural products that are out there but my main benefit was to look for one that will me smooth out my skin and reduce the appearance of my stretch marks.I have  kids  / years apart and my youngest literally stretched my tummy out beyond recognition. I have used several products that claim to improve and smooth blah blah blah but none has shown any consistency. I got to review this Organic Rosehip Oil and just said hey why not because nothing else has worked. After  weeks of daily and evening use on my tummy I am pleased to say I am back in a bikini. As much as I still have a nice figure my tiger stripes (stretch marks) really bother me and shot my confidence down. I was down in FL recently and really love how my tummy looks even after just  weeks. I am definitely continuing use to see how much more improvement I can get.Now I know that the smell isnt the best but really it isnt that bad. I expected it not to smell like perfume has been added because it clearly states pure unrefined organic rosehip oil. If you want to know a little trick which I do to help with the smell (which isnt overbearing) I use the rosehip oil in areas that I need then smooth over a very tiny bit of coconut oil. The texture isnt sticky or greasy and it absorbs very quickly. ALMOST  AND LOVE IT,Neutral
I received this item for the purposes of review via Tomoson.  The bottle of oil is impressive in size and I appreciate that it comes in a light resistant brown glass bottle.  The bottle was wrapped nicely and completely in bubble wrap for shipment +++.  The oil itself like my title says is a little thick and smells of flax.  This makes sense since Rosehips are high in lingans just like flax.  This odor does not dissipate.My suggestion if you plan on using this in your beauty routine is to only use it at night where you or others won't be bothered by the smell or the sheen.  It's not gross or anything it's just a bit much to take if you are wearing it all day.  Also it competes with the fragrance of lotions or perfumes you may be wearing.  I wore it under my makeup one day and didn't do it again. Good moisturizer a little thick and smells of flax,Neutral
I was surprised that the oil doesn't have a strong smell considering that it's from Rosehip. It's a plus because it won't clash with your perfume or any other products you use. It's very rich so a little goes a long way. It worked perfectly on my elbows knees and heels. and I love how it made them soft. It also brightened my dark elbows. As for my acne scars I noticed that they have become lighter as well. This is not just great for moisturizing the driest spots but it works as a skin brightener as well. Wonder Oil!,long way
It is a rich feeling oil that can moisturize and make your face feel so incredibly soft and smooth. This amazing oil is USDA Certified Pure Organic Unrefined Cold pressed Rosehip Seed Oil.It is naturally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega   and ) and Vitamin A and C that make it a face hair nail and skin restorer. It is a chemical and preservative free formula extracted from (Rosa Mosqueta) that provides natural and safe protection and total skin revitalization.I could not believe how amazing this oil helped my dry skin on my face but where I got the most benefit was on my elbows heels and hands.  I have extremely dry skin due to Hypothyroid and RA so I am constantly on the lookout for products that can alleviate the itching dry skin that I suffer with. I have even taken small drops and rubbed them into my scalp to stop the itching and it really does work. I do have dry hair also so it does not make my hair oily. I am not sure what it would do to someone who has oily hair so I caution those who have oily hair to double check first before using in your hair.Also InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil is recommended for aging sun-damaged dry flaky uneven pigmented skin. It can be used to fight aging reduce scars and marks provide nourishment/hydration to skin give protection and care to hair and nails. I do have to tell you that it does not have a rose like scent like the Moroccan Rose Water. InstaNatural believes in the earthy scent of pure oil so you won't see the rose scent in this oil. Which is a good thing because wearing it could clash with your perfume or other fragranced products that you use. Sometimes it's best not to have a scent and this is one of those times. Love this versatile oil,dry skin
The Rosehip Seed Oil is a pretty amazing product. It has so many uses. First it can be used as a moisturizer.  I was a little worried it would leave my skin feeling greasy but the oil rubs in evenly leaving behind only softness and no oily residue. It also works wonders on scars. My daughter has been having issues with hives. She scratched some and they scarred up her legs. After using this product about two weeks those scars have pretty much faded completely.  I don't have stretch marks myself but you can also use this oil both to prevent and to treat them. If that's not enough a little on your hair can add luster and shine and applying it your nails will strengthen them so they an grow long and healthy.The bottle comes with a little pump dispenser. A little goes a long way so this four oz bottle should last for a least a few months with moderate use. Overall an amazing product with no perfumey scents that really works and is made with only all-natural and organic ingredients. Organic RoseHip Oil,long way

Rosehip seed oil is a type of oil produced from rose hip seeds. This oil has a high concentration of vitamin A which makes it ideal for many skin uses. Always consult with a doctor before trying any new skin care product to ensure the health and safety of your skin. If a doctor gives permission to use the oil there are many uses for the oil.BurnsRosehip seed oil contains a high concentration of vitamin A. Vitamin A can help counteract some of the damage accrued by burning through unnatural causes and through sun burn. The vitamin A activates with the skin to speed the healing process. Rubbing the rosehip seed oil into the skin will help speed the healing process of all burns.ScarsRosehip seed oil can also help repair scar damage left by eczema acne burns stretch marks and minor cuts. The same ingredient that helps to heal burns can also help heal scars. The vitamin A absorbs into the skin and encourages the body to heal itself from deep inside the skin. The rosehip seed oil cannot erase the presence of scars but it can diminish the appearance of some minor scars.MoisturizerRosehip seed oil is a dry moisturizing oil. It is called a dry oil because it seeps deep into the skin leaving the skin feeling moisturized and refreshed without leaving a sticky or oily residue on the surface of the skin. With continued use the skin should feel younger and firmer.WrinklesSome individuals use rosehip seed oil as a remedy and filler for skin wrinkles. The continued use of the product can fill in fine lines and make them less visible to the naked eye. The oil does not eliminate the presence of wrinkles but rather plumps the skin and makes the wrinkles harder to see. This is an ideal treatment under makeup to create a flawless canvas for foundation application.NailsThe high concentration of vitamin A in rose hip seed oil makes it an ideal strengthener for nails. Rubbing the oil around nails and cuticles can help strengthen the nails to help them grow longer and thicker.HairRosehip seed oil can help condition dry and damaged hair. The vitamin A inside the oil nourishes the scalp and helps encourage healthy hair growth. The oil also helps condition the individual hair strands making them stronger and healthier.I was sent VoilaVe&#; Organics % Pure and Organic Rosehip Oil to check out for myself which can be used for many applications such as: wrinkles scars stretch marks rashes burns acne scars dry skin dermatitis age spots brittle nails psoriasis eczema hyper-pigmentation radiation and sun damage dry & damaged hair anti-inflammatory. It&#;s % pure and USDA and ECO Certified Organic by Ecocert through NOP. Now please note that this does NOT smell like roses. I know it would be great if it does but it doesn&#;t. With that said though it doesn&#;t stink. It also doesn&#;t have a perfume smell. There is an odor but it&#;s a bit hard to describe but it&#;s not awful as some oils I&#;ve smelt. This product is really amazing. It leaves your skin silky soft and I can actually see it working on my fine lines so far (just started using it)! Now I don&#;t have wrinkles yet I&#;m only  but I do have imperfections such as stretchmarks from pregnancies. No they&#;re not gone at least not yet but you can see the improvement since using the oil. The redness/purpleness of the stretch marks are lightening up and becoming more uniform with the surrounding healthy skin.This product goes on smoothly and does not cause a single adverse reaction to my skin. I have not broken out and believe it truly hypoallergenic. I&#;ve heard others with super sensitive skin can even use it without any problems! Not only have I used this for stretch marks I also have started putting this on my face. I was weary at first about putting an oil on my face but I gave it a shot since I&#;m looking for something with good acne-clearing and skin toning abilities. It only takes a little bit to moisturize the entire face and it absorbs very quickly. It does not look shiny or greasy at all. I can truly say that it heals blemishes and fresh acne issues nearly overnight at most  days. It heals acne on the spot which is a miracle! It actually dries them out (you can see it if you look at a pimple in the mirror after applying this) and you&#;ll see it just basically shrink into nothing within a day. No redness no whitehead&#;it&#;s amazing!!You have to try this product for yourself to believe how great it is. It is worth every dollar which isn&#;t very much honestly;  just $.. The smell may throw some people off but I have been reassured by holistic professionals that this product should have a flax seed type smell to it and it also depends on a woman&#;s status on her menstrual cycle how the smell is perceived! With that said once the product is on you you do not smell anything at all. The scent completely dissipates and blends in with whatever other oils/lotions you use. The color is orange but it rubs in colorless. Don&#;t be afraid to try something natural and good for your body! A miracle oil!,little bit
Manly Stretch Mark's?. It does happen as I have noticed over the year's. As I have gotten older I have noticed my bicep'spec's and forearm's have lost size and tone. Which in turn leave's behind some loose skin. I found this cream and over a course of three week's  is starting to tighten my skin a bit. Which is a hopeful sign that if I follow my regimen of applying morning and night thing's will continue to improve. All in all that makes me feel a little younger. Also there is no perfumey smell.

CeraVe Baby Wash and Shampoo is great for your baby's skin and hair. The baby formula is great because it doesn't have any perfumes or scents and this keeps your baby's skin from drying out and becoming irritated. This wash is also good because there is no sticky film and your baby is clean from head to toe.The CeraVe baby wash and shampoo can also be used as a face wash for adults if you have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and can't trust my skin to just any face wash and I tried this and this formula and it is perfect for my face it didn't dry it out and my face felt so smooth and clean aftewards All in One.,sensitive skin
This is a smooth non-sticky lotion. What I love is that it has no noticeable fragrance. I am sensitive to many perfumes and even some &#;natural&#; odors so this is great for me to use.Babies will benefit from that too. Your baby cannot tell you if the smell bothers them although if they react strongly (i.e. coughing or choking) to a perfume you can probably figure it out. But when babies are just slightly annoyed from a fragrance all they can do is sniff or get cranky. Children and adults often react that way to fragrances too.This lotion was developed to be non-toxic and it seems to be at least with our current knowledge. It's very pleasant. Really nice lotion and Adults can Use it Too,Neutral
Cerave Baby Lotion has a complex formula with several different ingredients to condition and protect the skin and lock in moisture.  It is very viscous white and has a slightly medicinal smell as there are no perfumes.When applied generously it provides some protection even after being exposed to moisture which makes it good not only for diapered babies but for adults who need a long-lasting lotion to apply before exercising bathing or swimming.Active Ingredient: DimethiconeInactive Ingredients: Purified Water Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Cetostearyl Alcohol Cetyl Alcohol Emulsifying Wax Niacinamide Ceramide  Ceramide -II Ceramide  Hyaluronic Acid Allantoin Tocopheryl Acetate Lauric Acid Zinc Citrate Polygylceryl- Diisotearate Behentrimonium methosulfate Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate Arginine PCA Potassium Phosphate Dipotassium Phosphate EDTA Sodium PCA Phytosphingosine Cholesterol Xanthan Gum Carbomer Conditions and protects the skin,Neutral
Is it wrong for an adult male to use a &#;baby lotion?&#;  I don't think so.  I have aging dry skin -- particularly on my face during the winter months.  Most days I simply use a sunscreen but there are times that I simply want to put on a little moisturizer when I'm not planning to go out into the sun.  Lots of moisturizers are too heavy/greasy feeling but not this one.  It absorbed very quickly and evenly into my skin.  Best of all it has little scent.  (I'm tempted to say &#;no scent&#; because I didn't notice any added perfume but since every skin care product has its own scent it's probably more accurate to simply say this is unscented.)Highly recommended to baby your adult skin.  ;) I'm not a baby nor do I have a baby but I love this lotion,dry skin
I had never used Carave lotion although it had been recommended once by my child's pediatrician. It absorbed quickly left no greasy residue left the skin seeming moisturized and had no perfumey odor as expected.I did not use it on severely dry or eczema-affected skin as I use stronger preparations for that and am dubious of lotions for such areas.It seems rather pricey so minus one star for that.I received for free from Amazon Vine which requires my review.Regarding the shipment: Amazon has in the past shipped lotions and other liquids in an envelope with no protection generally leading to leaks of up to half the bottle. I am happy to say that this was shipped inside a sealed plastic pouch and was received with no damage. Athough shipping it in a padded envelope would not have been my idea of a safe mode of transport it arrived intact. Pleasant feel on body  works well,Neutral
Okay. It&#;s a water bottle. But it&#;s a *pretty* water bottle. If you have to have something constantly in your line of vision why not go for something with a little pizzazz? I have a number of black and pink bottles nestled around my Chanel. Not all of them are expensive but on display together they look phenomenal. This little number fits right in. I&#;m always looking for the perfect container &#; something that combines function and beauty &#;for my bathroom countertop.  It cleans easily (although I probably wouldn&#;t put it in the dishwasher. I&#;m not sure how well the rhinestones would do). It does a great job with spritzing but not so much with misting (still repurposing an old perfume bottle for that). SO fun!,Neutral
My daughter suffers from Trichotillomania which is a hair pulling disorder.  I have been looking for some assistance to try and get that under control.  This Dead Sea Mud Shampoo has done a better job at controlling it than any other product to date.  I tend to be the person to wash her hair so we can make sure all suds are fully washed out.  When I started scrubbing in this shampoo I was most amazed with how great it suds-ed up!  There were suds everywhere!  It does have a slight odor to it but not a medicinal odor at all - more of a perfume type scent.  She does seem to be pulling her hair out less since we have been using this for about a week.  I will re-evaluate after we have been using it for a while longer.  But I am very happy with the product and quite impressed with how clean everything feels afterwards.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. Definitely helping my daughter,Neutral
I was provided a bottle of this shampoo in exchange for an unbiased review. Dead Sea Mud Shampoo by Adovia really pampered my hair which is on the thin side but with a slight wave to it. Upon first use a bunch of my waves near my face turned into curls and ringlets a fun and positive effect I did not expect but enjoyed nonetheless; the shampoo's claim that it adds body and volume is definitely validated by my experience.Before I started using the Adovia shampoo I had been suffering from a dry and irritated scalp for about a week or so but after the first use of this product my feelings of discomfort disappeared altogether. After several days of use my scalp felt like it was completely back to normal. Again one of the shampoo's main benefits scalp conditioning was validated by my positive firsthand experience. I am happy this shampoo was able to bring me some immediate relief on first use and then helped my scalp heal in less than one week.I must also remark about this shampoo's lovely scent which I would characterize as a sweet perfume with baby powder notes. My hair smelled fantastic even when I skipped a day between shampoos. It's so surprising and refreshing to find a shampoo that treats my scalp issues effectively without smelling at all medicinal. Also it's nice to use a product containing the renowned Dead Sea mud that does not smell earthy at all just fresh and clean.Even though my review time is technically over I am going to continue to use up my entire shampoo bottle in the days to come and there is a strong likelihood I will buy more when it is gone--that's how good this Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo really is. I give this shampoo  stars without reservation and recommend it to anyone who wants more body and bounce in their locks along with a healthy scalp. Wonderfully Scented Moisturizing Shampoo featuring Dead Sea Mud,Neutral
I love that this shampoo bottles up Dead Sea salt and minerals to benefit hair and scalp. It leaves my hair feeling so soft - but not too soft like some chemical-laden shampoos can do. It's gives my fine hair the perfect balance of moisturized and clean. I also feel like my hair doesn't get greasy as fast as it usually does which maybe is due to a healthier scalp from this shampoo.The smell of this mud shampoo is really nice - it does not smell like mud. It has a nice natural smell with just a hint of perfume. Definitely one of my new favorite products. Works Really Well - Natural Healing Properties,Neutral
First the scent. I can't quite put my finger on the perfume that it reminds me of but it smells so good!! I want it bottled to wear everyday! Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is not just a pretty scent but the shampoo is fabulous!The shampoo doesn't feel grainy or like mud it is however brown until you start massaging it into your hair and scalp then turns white. I definitely get plenty of rich soft suds. My hair has TONS of BODY and SHINE since I've started using Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.I have very thin lifeless color treated hair. Dead Sea Mud Shampoo doesn't stain my blonde highlights. It doesn't change the color of my hair in the least. My hair is soft! FULL and my scalp is totally and completely itch and flake free. My hair feels awesome!!If you have dry scalp like I do this is one great shampoo to try!! The shampoo contains Chamomile and Olive Oil which keeps your hair from drying out as it keeps natural moisture in scalp. I felt a difference from the first shampoo!LOVE!!! Awesome Stuff!!,Neutral
I received this product for my honest review.The Adovia Dead Sea Mud shampoo has a very light scent that I really loved. Some shampoos smell too heavily of perfume but the Adovia Dead Sea Mud shampoo has a much more natural scent. I used about a nickel sized amount of shampoo when I wash my hair. While you don&#;t get a lot of lather it definitely does a great job.  I don&#;t suffer from a scalp-related problem however this shampoo leaves my hair so soft that I would definitely continue to use it again for just that reason. I was worried that using a shampoo with mud in it would weigh down my hair. Since I have very thin hair that&#;s a big concern of mine.  Thankfully I did not notice any difference in the body my hair had after I used it. I love that this shampoo is not tested on animals. That is very important to me and I look for products marked not tested on animals when I shop. Love this shampoo!,Neutral
My ReviewI just love this shampoo. It lathers up nicely and truly cleans your hair and leaves it clean and shiney.  I have used it and seen a great improvement in my scalp and in my hair. Everyone says my hair looks nice and healthy and no longer dried out . It smells wonderful and feels great when your shampooing.  I even got  &#; Something smells good from my Husband ! &#;.  I am sensitive to perfumes and such and this did not bother me at all.I will be using this for a long time to come !Linda Excellent Shampoo !,long time
I really like this shampoo! It makes my hair soft and silky and my hair looks healthy. The (mostly) healthy ingredient list is a HUGE plus - Dead Sea Mud Olive Oil Vitamin E and Aloe Vera. My only disappointment is that is does have a fragrance in it. There really is no need to have Sea Mud Olive Oil Vitamin E mixed with a perfume.  I'm usually sensitive to smells from fragrance but thankfully the scent is light and hardly noticeable. The fragrance aside I like the shampoo and would recommend it.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. It makes my hair soft and silky and my hair looks healthy.,Neutral
When I first got this shampoo I thought it would be very thick and gritty. I was also a little nervous about the smell that it may have during and after use! Also I feared that my hair would be really stiff and stringy after using it.Since I thought it was going to be so thick (like a paste....is what I thought)....I started to pour quickly into my hand and I was VERY surprised as it poured out! It was nowhere near as thick as I had expected and the amount I poured into my hand and used was really more than I would have needed!So it really is not gritty at all and it is pretty thin! The other concern I had about smell......the smell was NOT gross. It was actually scented almost perfume-y (is that even a word...lol) The scent was a little stronger than I would normally like but after you rinse out the shampoo....the scent is not too strong and it isn't bad at all. The shampoo did lather really well!Once dry and brushed.....my hair is not stiff or stringy at all! On the contrary actually it is very soft and has a beautiful shine! I love this shampoo. I am happy with the outcome and I would recommend it to anyone looking to try something new! Really like this shampoo,Neutral
This Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is only made with the best ingredients. The main ingredient Dead Sea Mud is an ingredient that will create a enriching and nutritious product for your hair making it clean and not dirty.This Shampoo is full of minerals and nutrients that are found in the dead sea and work wonders on the hair. I think after my first use I'll never go back to old name brand shampoos again! The feeling of it is like a normal shampoo feel bit sticky and nothing out of the unusual. After I applied it to my hair and washed it out I felt like my head was cleaner and not dried out. I also felt my hair becoming soft and silky not frizzy.I can definitely tell the difference and how hydrated my hair became with the use of the Dead Sea Shampoo. Plus Your getting those natural nutrients that will make the hair stronger and healthier! Also I'd like to mention that the smell isn't gross so don't think of it as a wet/earthy mud smell instead your smelling a perfume like scent from the other wonderful ingredients.This product is very well known to help relieve the issues of dandruff itchy and dry scalp as well as Psoriasis.Here is a list of the main ingredients in the bottle:*Dead Sea Mud*Olive Oil*Shea Butter*Chamomile*Vitamin EThese ingredients allow for a more nourishing and smooth flake free scalp It will never leave your scalp dry or even your hair.A very terrific shampoo and great smelling as well! Wonderful for the hair!,Neutral
I have found my skin seems to be so dry the past few years. Moisturizing is hard work once you hit your 's. It is a real struggle...at least for me.  I am always looking for something to really make a difference and keep my skin looking youthful.  I was intrigued to hear about Emu Oil. I find that I use the emu oil right after my shower and it keeps my skin looking smooth and eliminates that parched look. It has been lasting all day long. This is nice especially because the weather has been warmer and I wear dresses and skirts often. I don't want to look down and see dry legs.  Emu oil has eliminated that problem for me. I feel confident and professional all day long. I don't notice much of a scent but I like that because I can use my own perfume.  My skin can be sensitive but I have found no issues with the emu oil.  That really elevates Emu Oil and makes it a super skin moisturizer for me.  I have also used it after my shower to keep my hair and scalp moisturized. I just use a drop right out of the shower and gently rub it into my scalp and hair. I notice my hair styles so much nicer and looks great. Emu oil is a great all around moisturizer.,Neutral
As I get older I get more serious about my skin care.  I am constantly on the lookout for good skin products.  I am delighted to be introduced to this eye product.Why I love this product:* It works.  This is the most important thing for me.  Even after only a few uses I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes were less obvious.  Of course nothing will completely get rid of the dark circles short of surgery but this product does a nice job of making them less noticeable.* It&#;s gentle on my skin.  My skin is very dry especially around the eyes so I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.* It&#;s natural.  I wasn&#;t completely sure what &#;wildcrafted&#; meant but according to Wikipedia it is the &#;harvesting of plants in their natural or wild habitat for medicinal or food purposes.&#;  When I read the ingredient list for retail skin creams it&#;s all unpronounceable chemical names.  This product has things like:  aloe vera geranium and periwinkle.  Sounds like a delightful herb garden.The smell is medicinal which might take some getting used to.  But it is a lot better than the heavy perfumed and artificial smell of most skin creams.If you are looking for a natural product that works this is for you!* I received a free sample of this product for testing and review. Nice light eye gel that really works,Neutral
This conditioner has a mild flowery perfume scent and squeezes out of the bottle easily.After I washed with the Dead Sea mud shampoo I used the Dead Sea salt conditioner. I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out. I noticed that my hair felt soft and silky. I love that feeling! When my hair dried my hair looked so healthy and vibrant. My hair was also still very soft. This conditioner is wonderful! Leaves hair soft and vibrant!,Neutral
First impression: I was impressed by the size of the bottle. It is . fl oz which is difficult to find in a deep conditioner. Usually deep conditioners come in a small bottle since you don&#;t use them as often and regular conditioner. Like I do with all beauty products I twisted off the cap and smelled the conditioner. It has a musty smell kind of like a deep cologne or perfume. I personally love the smell. It leaves an amazing scent on your hair for the rest of the day after using it.Before: My hair is very curly and dry. Since my hair is so dry it&#;s gets tangled every time I wash and condition it. The bottle says to shampoo first and then use the conditioner. It directs you to leave the conditioner on your hair for  minutes. I didn&#;t shampoo my hair first because I don&#;t like to use shampoo daily. I massaged the conditioner into my scalp and then spread it throughout my long hair. It says to use a dime size amount butI made sure that I used enough to cover every hair. I didn&#;t have to use very much a little went a long way which is incredible for conditioner.After: By the time  minutes was up I rinsed the conditioner out of my hair and boy was I happy! My hair felt amazing as I was rinsing it out! It felt so soft clean and smooth! After I got out of the shower my hair was very shiny and smelled great! My boyfriend even commented on how good my hair smelled. I am very happy with this deep conditioner!Read my full review here: [...] My New FAV Conditioner!,long way
Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner is very light in texture and has a light refreshing scent. It's not perfumey like some hair products can be. The conditioner did not weigh down my hair and made it feel soft and smooth not greasy at all. Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner is light in texture but conditions my hair perfectly,Neutral
I received this item for the purposes of review via Tomoson.  One of my pet peaves in skin and hair care is fragrance.  This smelled like an old perfume from Avon an elderly friend of my mom had when I was a kid blech.  The conditioner was a little on the thin side and didn't feel like it was coating my hair the way I felt it should.  I used it on myself and my two daughters to not the greatest results.  Our hair felt a little plasticky and not at all silky and easy to comb like I'd hoped.  Trying to comb out the knots in our hair was a huge challenge.  Styling it was a nightmare.  Even trying to keep my hair curly was thwarted and I ended up with a frizzy mess.As far as packaging goes it was sent well packaged.  Almost a little too well packaged because I almost cut myself trying to get the clear tape off the bottle that was holding the screw cap and flip top secured to the bottle for shipping. Nice conditioner but too floral,Neutral
The first thing I noticed is the scent. It smells so good. A lot of times conditioners will be a little too perfumery or sometimes when they&#;re particularly to &#;repair&#; the hair it will have more of a chemical scent.The conditioner had a really pleasant scent.I also liked the way it felt in my hair. It wasn&#;t heavy at all. It spread easily and evenly through my hair and I didn&#;t have to use too much to cover my hair completely. I&#;m a bit of a conditioner over user. Sometimes putting globs upon globs until I feel that there is enough.I went about my usual routine of drying my hair and it it felt instantly soft to the touch. My fingers ran through it easily and it didn&#;t feel dry. It actually did feel silky which is a nice change since my hair has been dull and in need of some type of deep conditioner for a while.My daughter loved the conditioner too.I highly recommend it! my hair feels and looks amazing...,Neutral
I thought that this cream went on very smoothly and was easy to apply. It absorbed quickly and I immediately noticed that my skin felt soft and smooth. It has a very mild scent - not an overly artificial or perfume-like smell that can be overbearing. It is a very fresh natural scent. There is no greasy feel to my skin after I apply the cream and it does not leave me feeling oily at all. Great cream for face neck and more,Neutral
My husband and I share a lot of the same health and beauty products. We use the same toothpaste the same shampoo and conditioner occasionally we have even been known to share the same deodorant. While there aren't a great deal of product lines for men some companies are beginning to realize that men need skin care too. InstaNaturals fills that bill with their Age Defying Moisturizer Cream a great product for both men and women.InstaNatural Age Defying Moisturizer Cream has a lot to offer. It has a light scent that won't linger and interfere with perfume or cologne. It reminds me of fresh cucumber or melon but I can't quite put my finger on the exact fragrance. The easy pump bottle helps ensure product is not wasted. One pump on my fingertips gives me just enough to cover my face and neck while two pumps covers those areas and my hands. My husband needs only one pump.This is a very light moisturizer but it does not contain sunscreen. InstaNatural is known for using quality natural ingredients so I believe that is why there is no sun protection. Because of the lack of SPF however  this is not my favorite moisturizer for my husband. He is so fair skinned and has a history of skin cancer that I want him in at least  SPF every day. My foundation contains sunscreen so I'm covered whether my moisturizer does or not. Moisturizer for men and women,great product
The serum is very lightweight and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without being oily or greasy. It absorbs very quickly and the pump top makes it very easy to use. A lot of other serums I have tried in the past come with a dropper which works well but can tend to be a bit messy. I typically use about - &#;pumps&#; to cover my face and neck area. it is perfect for every day use and I had absolutely no negative reactions to it. There was no noticeable fragrance to the serum so it didn't leave me feeling like I had put some sort of heavy perfume scented lotion on my face. I have been using this for about  weeks now and I have been very pleased with it. It leaves my skin feeling fresh which is great during the summer when so many other creams and serums make me feel like I need to wash my face after just a few hours. My skin is looking and feeling healthier - I think this would be a great product for women of any age. It not only helps to protect your skin but also helps reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles over time. Great Product for Healthy Youthful Looking Skin,great product
This serum is not too thick and does not feel greasy or oily on my face. I used it after the Dead Sea Salt Soap by Adovia. My skin feels soft and refreshed. The scent is very mild which I love. I don't like using perfumes on my face. I love Adovia products. Great results,Neutral
When I read this was a lifting & firming serum I was thinking of those gel like serums that you use around your eyes that kinda clear & dewy but this serum is so not like that it is a creamy white serum that absorbs into skin clear with no residue & it leaves your skin feeling firm toned & moisturized diminishing the visible fine lines & wrinkles like crows feet & laugh lines.Pump out a drop at a time because a little goes a long way.The only real con for me anyhow is it does have a bit of a stronger scent than I prefer but after reading others review they think the scent is a plus & they love it so I guess I am the only one that would prefer it be unscented but if you have issues with perfume type smells you might want to avoid this product. Otherwise it does work great & is very effective. Simply wash your face & pat dry & apply to skin in tiny circles working it in & fell the firmness start happening (not to firm kinda just right).Thank you to Adovia Face lift in a bottle? Maybe,Neutral
I have been using this product for about  weeks now and I love it ! It leaves my skin soft with no greasy feel to it at all. I can have full assurance that I am actually treating my skin in a good manner and doing something to help my skin not to age from dryness.  It has a soft scent to it that I also am sure does not upset my body as I am sensitive to many perfumes and chemicals. I just love Adovia  Facial Lift !Linda ... this product for about  weeks now and I love it! It leaves my skin soft with no ...,Neutral
Okay ... At first I was thinking &#;Yay! Free soap.&#; I have a slight addiction to soaps and things that smell good.THEN IT ARRIVED IN THE MAIL.I honestly do not think after trying this that I will buy anything else.First the smell because I always start with the smell. It smells AMAZING. There isn't one bad thing to say about the smell. I think I huffed the box a good five or six times getting myself excited for bath time.Second. You know how most soaps after you rinse them off your skin feel rough? Your fingers don't slide over smooth its a bumpy ride. This stuff. NOT THE CASE! I swear I feel like a baby. Well my skin does. It is really soft. So the moisturizing capabilities of this stuff is awesome. I normally use dove because its soft too. But this stuff blows my normal brand right out of the water.Third. Seems to have a slight healing capability too. I had broken out really bad after trying a lotion with too much perfume. my skin reacted so badly to it that I had little red bumps &#;Which naturally I had picked at and irritated farther.&#; ONE USE and they were almost gone. Two days ... they were finished. So I am thinking that if I had a really bad break out on my face &#;Which I don't know if its true because thanks to vitamin c serums I haven't have that issue.&#; But my assumption is that it would work on clearing that up quite well too. IF YOU GUYS TRY IT and you do have a problem with acne. Please let me know. &#;I am curious.&#;All in all this stuff ROCKS! I don't like the price tag off  dollars a bar ... but I love what it does for my skin so I will be looking past that. I truthfully LOVE this soap.Thanks for stopping by xxDee In love with this stuff!,Neutral
I am a lover of Adovia products so naturally this Dead Sea Salt Soap is no exception!The soap size is perfect for use on the face or even in the shower. I like to use mine with a loofah and create a nice lather that way. I have sensitive skin and I had no issues at all with this. I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation. As I mentioned above I use this in the shower on my body but also as a facial soap as well. It leaves my skin feeling very soft clean hydrated and smooth. I like the fact that I can use this soap all over makes for a better value.The smell is a fragrant clean sort of scent. I find that after I have used the soap I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin which is nice. I can use my perfumes over it and not have my perfume scent be mixed with my soap scent.I have had absolutely no issues with this soap at all and it is something I give my recommendation on trying!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience thoughts and review. Fantastic soap!,sensitive skin
Yet another superb product from Adovia!  I have now tried  products from Adovia containing the dead sea salt minerals and I have not been disappointed in either one.  I have been using this bar of soap for  days now and my skin is so soft and I feel so much more clean when I get out of the shower now.  I live in a very old house that has TERRIBLE water with rust and even the water softener does not help.  Since I started using the Adovia products I received my hair and skin has been so much better!  Using this soap has actually even helped reduce my acne.This soap smells so clean and fresh; comes in a regular size bar and is a very silky smooth white color.  The moment I opened the box from Amazon I could smell it and it was like heaven :)  I love body products that are not heavily perfumed but just smell wonderfully fresh.  You can most definitely smell the ocean in Adovia products and of course with all of the minerals from the Dead Sea Salts it is always good for your skin.This specific product retails for $ on Amazon and although it may seem expensive for a bar of soap the benefits FAR outweigh the costs if you appreciate the healthiness that comes along with using the product :)  Just check out the gorgeous photos of the sea salts that make the products!  Imagine being able to swim in that water every day and the health benefits it would bring!  Then just think of this soap and if you try it you will be hooked!***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest and open review*** Like swimming in the Dead Sea every day!,Neutral
This is a . ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over  Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc bromide sodium calcium magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed! Aaagghhhh...,Neutral
This soap has a nice subtle scent that is perfect for those with perfume allergies like myself. The soap further impressed me by giving a nice lather great body wash and to top that off without leaving a residue or drying out my skin. Texture wise it is a harder soap which makes it last longer and not melt in the shower like some others.For me Andovia's Dead Sea Salt Soap gives me the essence of having a salt scrub but without the mess! Superb Soap!,Neutral
I am not usually a fan of bar soap so I was skeptical when Adovia sent me this soap to try but I am completely converted!  I absolutely love this soap.  Not only does it leave my skin soft and smooth it smells AMAZING.  I don&#;t like super strong smells but this smells clean and nice without being overpowering like perfume.  Plus I have super sensitive skin so some products that I can use on my body I can&#;t use on my face because it will break out.  This doesn&#;t  - my face is perfectly fine with this as an in-shower cleanser.  Love it!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!The price is outstanding and it lathers really really well.  I will definitely be purchasing again in the future! I absolutely love this soap,sensitive skin
I will freely admit that i am a bit obsessed with soaps and bath products. I love trying different scents and brands and probably have enough body wash to last a lifetime (ok so that may be a bit of an overstatement bit I do have alot). My general preference isn't usually bar soap but was kindly sent this soap to test out so I figured it was worth a try.This is the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap.This is a face/body soap containing a combination of Dead Sea minerals and trace elements derived from Dead Sea Salt.The smell is an extremely pleasant and fresh scent. Not to mild and not to overpowering either. Just the perfect amount of perfume.It's very moisturizing and lathers well. Leaves you clean and smooth without stripping away to many of your skins natural oils. I also really enjoyed that it didn't leave any of that funky filmy residue that so many soaps do.It's a fairly good size but at $ a bar I suggest you not use it as your main soap.... especially if you live with multiple people.Overall I give it an /. I throughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone seeking a nourishing and effective soap!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free usingTomoson.com. Regardless I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. clean and soft,Neutral
To start I am a huge fan of bar soaps. I love how little packaging they have in comparison to liquid soaps and I also love that what packaging they do have is usually a box which is biodegradable. I'm all about reducing my waste so I don't have to worry about reusing or recycling much and bar soaps help with that goal.So I'm going in expecting to be pleased and I was overwhelmed! This is hands-down the most moisturizing bar soap I have ever tried and I've used absolutely wonderful hand-made cold-processed goat's milk soaps. Don't expect this soap to rinse squeaky clean - it leaves a slight film of something softening on your skin that soaks right in as soon as it's dried. You don't feel anything but smooth supple skin after you wash with this. I can definitely skip moisturizer on my face when I use it to wash away the day and I don't find my hands drying out nearly as much as they do with normal bar soaps - or even other good ones.It's also a hefty solid bar that's incredibly long-lasting. Most of the really moisturizing bar soaps I've tried have melted away quite easily especially if left in damp places (like the shower). This one just keeps going and going...I've used it multiple times a day for nearly two weeks straight now and you'd hardly be able to tell by looking at it - the logo has barely worn smooth.About the only thing that approaches a negative for me is the scent. It's very reminiscent of &#;old lady perfume&#; smells to me - that really heavy heady floral-type fragrance. It's incredibly strong in this soap so much so that it constantly fills the room with the scent even when you aren't using it. Fortunately though it doesn't linger much on the skin so I don't wind up smelling it all day long. Thanks to that I really don't have much of a complaint about the smell.Honestly it's hard to say anything bad about this product - I absolutely love it the price is reasonable and I'm definitely prepared to order more! One of the best bar soaps I've ever used!,Neutral
The Mineral soap arrived in great condition in a cute little box.  It is about the size of a regular bar of soap.  My mom was here the day it came and she said that it smells like ivory.  I thought it just had a strong soap smell.  I know imagine that the soap smells like soap :-).  There is no perfume or fruity like smells (which really is to be expected from an all natural soap) and it was very strong. However  During a shower the smell is not that strong and I really like how it smells on your skin.My husband is a carpenter so he is around dust dirt and is sweating for a good part of his day.  I thought he would benefit from this the most. It has been a few days now and I can feel a difference in my skin as well as see a difference in my husbands.  His pores on his face and back do not look as clogged and yucky like they usually do  he scrubs them twice daily before the new Mineral Soap and now with it.  The new soap has clearly made a difference!  You can feel a tightening in the skin almost immediately before even getting out of the shower. Soap DOES lather on a wash cloth! The bar seems to be lasting a decent amount of time. We have used it quite a bit and there is plenty left! I would most definitely buy this soap in the future as well as recommend to everyone! Dead Sea Salt Soap - Face and Body Soap - % Natural Soap,Neutral
This is a great product.i love that it doesn't have any perfume type smell. It's great that it's all organic. Based on the results right now I'm sure long term it will be a great product Great Cream,great product
It has a nice light creamy texture to it and it absorbs quickly into your skin. The gel does not have any perfume smell to it and to me it is really  quite scent free.The Adovia Mineral Eye Gel contains Dead Sea Salt and Minerals Vitamin C and Vitamin A Retinol which are amazing ingredients that help to reduce puffiness and dark circles under your eyes. It also includes Aloe Vera and Sweet Almond Oil to soothe and revitalize your skin. The Adovia Mineral Eye Gel is for all skin types which is nice for anyone. Your area under the eyes is very delicate and this eye gel is so perfect for it.Since I have been using the Adovia Mineral Eye Gel for a few days I am already seeing a slight difference around my eye areas. My skin looks more refreshed and radiant. I'm going to continue using this eye gel and would recommend it for any beauty regimen. Would recommend!,Neutral
I really like anything that comes from the Dead Sea as long as it's real.  I have used Adovia products before and just loved them.  So when they contacted Everything Beauty and Beyond to try this product I for sure thrilled!  This product arrived to my house about three weeks ago through amazon.com.When this product arrived I noticed that it came in a nice large jar with a screw off lib.  It was literally packed to the rim with dead sea salt.  The crystals were finely grind and very soft.  The salt had NO smell dye or perfume in it.  It is literally % Dead Sea salt.The product states that this is best to be used on oily acne prone skin.  I have neither however I still gave it a shot and saw that it left my face really clean.  However I decided to get creative with and try it on my body. I read on their site that you can combine this with olive oil which I did and used it as a body scrub.Boy was I amazed.  This literally worked as an amazing moisturizing scrub from my body with the olive oil mixed in.  I first mixed the salt and olive oil in a plastic bowl and took it into the shower with me.  I applied it to my body carefully (as you can slip in the shower) and really worked it in on elbows knees and feet.  I have to say my body really felt nicely exfoliated and moisturized!I would recommend this product if you have oil skin.  However if you don't then this can still work for you if you apply like a body scrub.  Since its all natural it really doesn't get any better then this! Dead Sea Salt for Multi Uses!,Neutral
Curel Rough Skin Rescue Lotion  Ounce does help soften my dry skin. Also I appreciate there is no perfume smell and no allergic reactions. Overall a good thick lotion for dry skin. I don't see the cost on this one via Amazon as of today. I would hope they'd include it via Prime for about $ and via the subscribe and save program as well. Curel Rough Skin Rescue  Ounce,dry skin
I've been a Curel user for years I usually stick with the Ultra healing formula and use it from head to toe. I've been using this formula on my body(not my face) since I feel like the olive oil addition could make me break out - I haven't found the &#;non-comedogenic&#; statement on the bottle so I don't want to be the guinea pig in that respect. Otherwise I do like it. Not too heavy though it takes a bit longer to sink in I'm guessing due to it being a very hydrating formula to rescue your skin. Fragrance free which is nice doesn't compete with my perfume. It does note not to go out directly into the sun due to the alpha hydroxy acid so I'm only using it in the evening. Nice lotion,Neutral
Being a nurse for quite a few years I've come to respect a good dry skin lotion.  My routine is to apply lotion nightly to my hands arms legs and feet at least.  This has maintained it in fairly decent shape through the cold dry Midwest winters and summers when you want to look good in your sandals.  Sometimes though I still have rough areas on my heels and feet.I was familiar with Curel products but hadn't purchased any for a while as I've had many scented products that I'd purchased or received as gifts.  I immediately opened this and used it after receiving it.  I will add that it was packaged well in a plastic bag in case of leakage which thankfully didn't happen.I thought that this felt a little greasy when first applied.  I had a few minutes of waiting before it was absorbed but I was so pleased with the way my skin felt later that day and into the night!  It really does the job on rough dry skin!This is a large bottle with a nice plunger that works.  You don't need a lot of lotion so it should last a long time.  There is no heavy scent to clash with your perfume if you wear it or to discourage men from using it as well.  My bottle is sitting on the vanity in our bathroom and I've told my husband to use it as his hands get rough and dry from working outside on our farms.I believe this will become a staple in our home.  I recommend you give it a try as I think you'll like it too! Wonderful Product for Dry Skin!,long time
I was sent some Advanced Anti Cellulite Treatment & Body Firming Cream to try out for myself and I honestly have to say I was rather skeptical.  I've been using the product for about a week now and much to my surprise I've seen some slight improvement already. Because of where my &#;lovely&#; marks are I didn't take before and after photos but I have noticed a small change. My stretch marks are still there and the cellulite is still there. The improvement comes in the fact that they have all lightened up a bit since using the cream. Remember it's only been about a week since I've used the cream. I use it after my evening showers before bed. I apply the cream and rub it in like any other lotion. It does have a slight smell - not stinkybut nothing you'd want to wear as a perfume scent either. Also you will feel a bit &#;greasy&#; feeling after applying the lotion and generally I wash my hands after to get it off. After a few minutes though I don't feel that way once the lotion has dried up. I don't feel any pain burning stinging or tingling. It's just like adding a lotion. After about a week is when I started seeing the improvement. While I don't know what the final results or how long it'll take to get there yet I'm feeling confident since seeing some improvement after just a week. I'm impressed and can't wait to further the results! If only there was a way to speed it up even faster! I'm impressed!,Neutral
